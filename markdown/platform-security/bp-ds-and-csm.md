# Domain separation and the Customer Service Management \(CSM\) plugin

For the best outcome, be aware of how the properties in the CSM plugin work. When the plugin is enabled, you can see the status of your records in your domains.

Instance owners should contact Customer Service and Support to enable the **csm\_auto\_account\_domain\_generation** property.

**Note:** This base system property is located in the system properties table and is available after CSM plugins are enabled.

-   **What the property does**

    Whenever a new account in the Customer Service application is created, a domain is created and placed under the TOP domain. If the parent field on the account form is populated, and a new record is inserted, it creates that account as a subdomain of the parent.

-   **What happens if this property is not true and the domain is enabled**

    New account records in a domain-separated environment are automatically placed in the default domain.


In the header bar, you can see the status of the records with the plugin enabled.
