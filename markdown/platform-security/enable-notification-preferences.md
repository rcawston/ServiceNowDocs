# Set preferences for security event notifications

Configure preferences for the types of notifications you want to receive for occurrences of specific security events. For each type, you designate whether to receive notifications by email, by push notification in Now Mobile, or in third party messaging applications such as Slack or Microsoft Teams.

## Before you begin

To enable third party messaging applications to send security event notifications, you must activate the Messaging Notification \(com.glide.notification.messaging\) plugin. Individual users must configure their own settings. For details, see [Notifications in messaging applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/messaging-integration.md).

Role required: admin.
