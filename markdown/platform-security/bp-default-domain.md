# Importance of the Default domain

Organizing your domains is a crucial part of the domain separation process. If you don't set a default domain, new tasks and user records go to the global domain. Anyone can see the records in the global domain, which means that data can be seen when it is not supposed to.

When you set the default domain, its records are not visible to any user other than an admin.

**Note:** The defaults access can be changed by granting users visibility to the default domain or the parent domain.

You should always set one default domain for the domain records on your instance. The default domain is where the system automatically assigns task and user records that are not already assigned to a domain.

When you create a default domain from the Domain Administration screen, add the name Default in the **Name** field to differentiate it from other domains. Check the **Default** check box for the record.

Maintain regularly the records that you create in the default domain and move them to the correct domains. If records show up often in the default domain, you may need to investigate why. Ideally, you should make sure that all records are created in their appropriate domains \(not global or default domains\).
