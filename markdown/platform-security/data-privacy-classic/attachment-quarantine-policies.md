# Attachment quarantine policies

Manage policies that automatically isolate suspicious attachments for security review and analysis.

## About this task

Role required: data\_privacy\_admin and admin

To create attachment quarantine policies, perform the following procedure:

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Security** &gt; **Data privacy** &gt; **Real time protection** &gt; **Attachment quarantine policies**.

3.  Enter a Policy Name for the policy.

4.  Toggle the **Active** button on if you want the policy to be enforced.

5.  Select **Add table**.

6.  Enter the tables you want the policy to apply to.

7.  Specify which data patterns you want to monitor for sensitive content in attachments.

    **Important:** Attachments matching the patterns you define here will be automatically quarantined. Users will receive an **Attachment Quarantined** message indicating the attachment was quarantined due to sensitive data detection, information on the scan result, and instructions for getting their attachment released.

8.  Select **Save** to set the table definitions as part of the policy.

    **Note:** You can define multiple tables for the policy to apply to.

9.  Select **Confirm** to save the policy.
