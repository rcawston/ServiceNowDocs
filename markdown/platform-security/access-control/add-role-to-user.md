# Adding Roles to users

Use the **Simulate Add Role** for simulating the user's access changes for a resource \(table\).

## Before you begin

Role required: access\_analyzer\_admin

Enable Take actions. For more information, see [Configuring the Access Simulator \(Take actions\)](configure-access-simulator.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Access Analyzer** &gt; **Access Simulator**.

2.  Select **Simulate** from the **Add a Role to the user** section.

3.  In the **Simulation criteria** view, configure the following fields:

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Select user \*|Specify a user name to select from the list. In this example, **Abel Tuter**.|
    |Select role \*|Specify a role to select from the list. In this example, **itil\_admin**.|
    |Rule type \*|Rule type is auto-populated and it can’t be changed.|
    |Select table \*|Specify a table name to select from the list. In this example, **Incident**.|
    |Select record|Specify a record name to select from the list \(Optional\).|
    |Select field|Specify a field name to select from the list. This field can be used to analyze permissions at the field level. For example, **Active**, **Created By**, and so on.|

4.  Click **Next**.

5.  Preview the changes.

    Use the **Preview changes** view to see a simulation of your configured choices. Validate the roles and child roles that have been added to the user before moving to the next step.

    In this example, you can see the new child roles that have been added in this simulation \(highlighted in green, as **Role or Group being added**\) as part of the **itil\_admin** role, along with the user's currently assigned roles \(Role or group being unchanged\).

6.  Click **Next**.

7.  In the **Simulated results** view, check the **Present status** and **Simulated status** to validate that access is **Passed** or **Blocked** to the simulated user as intended.

    In this example, adding the **itil\_admin** role enables the user to perform delete operations on the table \(Incident\).

    **Note:**

    -   To know more about an ACL \(operation\) in the **Simulated results** view, click its operation link.
    -   To start the simulation again for a different role, click **Start over**.
    -   To exit the simulation, click **Exit**.
8.  Click **Next**.

9.  To apply the simulated changes, on the **Take action** view, click **Add and complete** .

    ![Actions](../images/simulate-add-actions.png)

    **Note:**

    -   If Access Simulator isn’t enabled, you can't complete the simulation. To enable it, select **Enable actions** and accept the legal information.
    -   To hide the simulation, select **Hide actions**. To unhide and enable actions, go to **Settings**. For more information, see [Configuring the Access Simulator \(Take actions\)](configure-access-simulator.md).
    -   To exit the simulation without applying the simulated changes, select **Skip and Exit**.
    If you clicked **Add and complete**, the simulated roles are successfully added to the user. You can verify the access again by using the Access Analyzer. For more information about how to verify access of a user, see [Access Analyzer](access-analyzer.md).
