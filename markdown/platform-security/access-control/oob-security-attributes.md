Following security attributes are added for client session \(plugin: `com.glide.client_session_security_attributes`\):

-   **IsIframeEmbeddedSession**: The attribute is used in embedded iframe in third party portals. For example, Engagement messenger, Virtual Agent Web Client, Embedded Session, and so on.
-   **IsIntegrationAsAServiceSession**: The attribute is used in messaging apps like Virtual Agent in teams, Virtual Agent in slack, Virtual Agent in whatapp.

**Note:** You must use the **IsIframeEmbeddedSession**, **IsIntegrationAsAServiceSession**, and **IsIntegrationAsAUserSession** only while configuring client type for OAuth and SSO records. To learn more, see [Configure client type for OAuth and SSO records](../authentication/client-type.md).
