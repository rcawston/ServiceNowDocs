# Domain assignments

How you assign a domain impacts the value of the sys\_domain field. The assignments contain designs and business properties that affect how the application functions in each domain.

## Value of the sys\_domain field

The value of the **sys\_domain** field contains the domain that is assigned to the record by any of the following:

-   Company to which the user belongs
-   Business rule that is used when creating the record
-   Module that is used when creating the record
-   Form template that is used when creating the record
-   Domain of the parent record
-   Domain that is assigned to the User record
-   Domain of the user who creates it

Make sure that your domain assignment strategies and designs are well documented and tested so that you are creating records as those strategies and designs are inserted into the correct domain. That way you can see that the properties of each domain should you need to duplicate or modify them.
