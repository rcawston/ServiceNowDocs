# Contains queries and domain access

Use a "contains" query only in special cases, such as when users or groups need to see data from a domain that they don't have access to, but you don't want to move those users to a domain. Creating domain "contains" and user or group access for a domain should be an exception, only when absolutely needed.

"Contains" is a domain-to-domain relationship that is many-to-many, and has no effect on the flow of process. If you create a large number of domain "contains" relationships or provide broad access, you will generate queries with too many OR conditions. OR conditions are slow and impact the performance of your instance. Instead of using too many "contains" relationships, set up your domain hierarchy as follows:

![Sample query](../image/bp-contains-domain-visibility.png "Sample query")

Before you move users to a domain, make sure that they really should have access to that domain. Weigh the benefits and limitations. The query above is for just one contains relationship. If you have a domain that contains another domain, and that domain is the parent of a number of other domains, you will have many more OR conditions. Be careful when you create a domain map so that you do not impact the performance of your instance.
