## Review multiple instances

![Multi-instance view of the security posture dashboard](../images/spd-multiple.png)

View the security posture of your non-production instances without leaving your production instance using the **All instances** tab at the top of the dashboard. The **All instances** tab displays a condensed version of the same information as the **This instance** tab, but also includes data from all your non-production instances.

By default, the **All instances** tab displays information on the production instance you’re logged in to, and all non-production instances across all your production environments.

You may add or remove instances that appear on this dashboard by modifying your trust configuration. Providing data visibility between instances allows them to appear within your dashboard. For details on this process, see [Basic trust configuration for data sync applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/grant-access-other-instances.md).

## Dashboard customization

The instance security posture dashboard can’t be customized, but you can duplicate the dashboard by selecting the **More Actions** \(![More actions](../../../reuse/icons/product-icons/ellipsis-vertical-fill-24.svg)\) icon and selecting **Duplicate**. You can change the duplicate dashboard.
