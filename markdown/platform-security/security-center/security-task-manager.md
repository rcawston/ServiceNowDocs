Access the Security Tasks by navigating to **All** &gt; **Security Center** &gt; **Security Tasks**. By default, all tasks are displayed in the list. You can easily filter upcoming, overdue, or open tasks by selecting the cards above the list. These cards also display the current count of tasks in each of these categories. You can further refine your filter by using the normal table field filtering options and then selecting the filter button \(![filter button](../images/filter-panel-icon.png)\), then selecting the Advanced view button to create and save a custom filters to use later.

## User roles

The Security Tasks use the following roles:

|User|Required role|Description|
|----|-------------|-----------|
|System Administrator|admin|System Administrators can view, create, assign, and delete Security Tasks.|
|Security Center Viewer|sn\_vsc\_security\_center\_viewer|Viewers can view, but not create, delete or edit Security Tasks.|
|Security Task Manager|sn\_vsc\_task\_manager|Security Task Managers can work on assigned tasks, view task manager-related pages, and create and manage tasks within Security center. They can view tasks assigned to other users but can't edit tasks assigned to other users. Task managers can't access non-task manager pages in Security Center.|
|ITIL|itil|ITIL users can interact with Security Tasks assigned to them, but can't view all tasks as the admin and Security Task manager roles can.|
