# Customer Actions

Use the Customer Actions tool to implement important security updates based on your instance and the configuration of plugins.

![Customer Actions app homepage](../images/critical-updates-homepage.png)

ServiceNow updates your instance with family releases and patches to keep base system platform code and functionality current and secure. However can be additional actions you can take to secure your instance that are unique to your custom instance configuration. These recommended updates are found in the Customer Actions tool.

|Feature|Customer Actions|Family releases and patches|
|-------|----------------|---------------------------|
|Definition|Manual, guided tasks for admins to implement important security changes.|System-driven updates applied automatically during family releases or patches.|
|Purpose|Address security risks that can’t be resolved by ServiceNow upgrades alone. Designed to avoid disrupting custom configurations.|Keep platform code and functionality current and secure.|
|Examples|Deprecating weak certificates, enforcing multi-factor authentication \(MFA\), disabling insecure protocols.|Platform version upgrades, patch-level fixes, backend security enhancements.|
