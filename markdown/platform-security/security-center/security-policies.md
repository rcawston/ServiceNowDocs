# Security Event Notifications

View, manage, and analyze the default security event notification policies on your ServiceNow instance, as well as access the functionality to create custom policies.

Customize and create notification policies that trigger email notifications when users perform actions in the ServiceNow AI Platform that might be insecure or require admin monitoring.

Admins can customize the values for the default policies, clone, and edit default policies or create their own custom ones.
