# Instance Security Center

Monitor the compliance level of instance security controls, view security event monitoring metrics, and configure and maintain instance security settings all from within the Instance Security Center. The Instance Security Center consolidates several key security components into a single control console that helps you detect, protect, and respond to instance-based security events.

**Important:**

Instance Security Center \(ISC\) has reached the end of sales as of September 2024, and is no longer supported or available for new activation.

ServiceNow Security Center \(SSC\) is the recommended solution going forward. For more information, see [Instance Security Center to ServiceNow Security Center migration](instance-security-center-to-security-center-migration.md).

## Instance Security Center components

To access the Instance Security Center, navigate to **System Security** &gt; **Instance Security Center** or the System Administration homepage.

![Instance security center homepage](../image/instance-security-center.png)

The Instance Security Center homepage contains the following security components:

-   Administrator messages
-   Rotating security banner
-   Search
-   Security event ribbon
-   Daily compliance score
-   PCI Configuration Controls Score
-   Session Management
-   Hardening
-   Auditor
-   Metrics \(user, email, and antivirus\)
-   Resources
-   Security notifications
-   Tours
-   Security testing portal
-   Security center
-   Help
-   Virtual Agent access

From the Instance Security Center homepage, you can view the security compliance score for your instance and monitor its overall security health. You can then configure or update system properties that are related to your instance security so that they comply with security requirements.

**Note:** The Instance Security Center does not support domain separation.

## User roles

To use the Instance Security Center, you must have the admin or security\_dashboard\_user role.

To learn more about managing per-user subscriptions, see [Managing per-user subscriptions in Subscription Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/managing-user-subscriptions-v2.md) and contact your account representative.

</table>**Warning:** To ensure that the Instance Security Center receives up-to-date security information with every upgrade, do not customize this module. If you change any security settings on your instance, make sure that you test them in a non-production environment first.

## Administrator messages

Messages and reminders, intended mostly for administrators, appear above the rotating security banner.

For example, a `Configure Security Notifications` message appears to remind administrators to configure preferences for security notifications if they have not done so. It also points them to the proper page to do so.

**Note:** The administrator messages banner does not appear for non-admin users, or if there are no actionable items for admin users.

## Rotating security banner

To assist you in monitoring the security health of your instance, critical instance security messages appear in the rotating banner.

-   Two to three security messages normally rotate at a regular interval.
-   The dots at the bottom of the banner show you the total number of current security messages.
-   To navigate through them, select the dots, or select the arrows that appear on either side of the messages.

The banner background colors indicate the relative severity of the messages.

|Color|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Red|Critical security situation requiring a timely response, or a recommendation on how to protect or respond to critical security events.|
|Dark gray|Non-critical warning message.|
|Blue|General information message.|

To collapse or minimize the text content in the banner, select ![Collapse/expand banner](../image/Inst_sec_center_banner_collapse_expand.png). To maximize the text content, select it again.

-   When you use the Instance Security Center again, the text content appeared as collapsed or expanded, depending on how you used it during your previous session.
-   If the text content itself changes, it appears as maximized for all users.

## Search

Use the search bar to search the entire Instance Security Center for security resources that assist you with understanding and resolving security issues. You can search the following security-related resources:

-   Now Support Knowledge Base articles
-   Instance Security Center pages
-   External Now Support links
-   PA security widgets, such as the Daily Compliance Score and External Incoming Emails
-   Banner content

## Event ribbon

Use the event ribbon to view key security event monitoring metrics for the current instance.

-   To manually scroll through the metrics, select the right or left arrow keys.
-   To configure the event ribbon, select **Edit**.

To learn more about the event ribbon and how to configure it, see [Monitor security events](instance-sec-center-event-ribbon.md) and [Configure the security event ribbon](instance-sec-center-configure-event-ribbon.md).

## Daily compliance score

The Daily Compliance Score section contains the **Daily Compliance Score**, **Session Management**, **Hardening**, **Auditor**, and **Resources** tiles.

You use the Daily Compliance Score to gauge how healthy your instance is from a security standpoint.

The Daily Compliance Score is a percentage score. It is based on how compliant the current settings of your instance security properties are with the compliance values published in the [Hardening settings](instance-security-hardening-settings/security-hardening-settings.md).

-   To learn more about Daily Compliance Score calculations, and how hardening settings impact it, see [Check the daily compliance score and configure security property settings](instance-sec-center-hardening.md).
-   The **Refresh** button enables an administrator to instantly recalculate the Daily Compliance Score. To learn more, see [How Daily Compliance score, trend, and graph data is refreshed](how-daily-compl-score-trend-date-refreshed.md).

## Hardening

Use this process to adjust the specific security configuration properties that affect the Daily Compliance Score:

1.  To access the Hardening Compliance Configurations page and perform instance security hardening, select the **Daily Compliance Score** tile or the **Hardening** link.
2.  Specify whether you want to view all or only recommended security controls. Then, select the category you want to work in.
3.  Set each security configuration property in the selected category. Click **More Info** to view detailed information for a property.

To learn more about hardening and optimizing security configuration properties to further increase compliance, see [Adjust instance security settings to increase compliance](update-security-hardening-params.md).

To learn more about how trend and graph data is refreshed, see [How Daily Compliance score, trend, and graph data is refreshed](how-daily-compl-score-trend-date-refreshed.md).

## Auditor

Run the Auditor to scan your instance and find incorrect security definitions. It provides findings you can correct to help improve the security posture of your instance.

To access the Auditor page, select the **Auditor** tile or the **Auditor** link. To learn more, see [Scan for incorrect security definitions](scan-for-incorrect-security-definitions.md).
