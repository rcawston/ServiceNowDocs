# Use agentic AI in Now Assist for Vault

Use the Now Assist for Vault agentic workflows to complete tasks autonomously.

**Note:** Depending on your license, you will have access to certain application features, generative AI skills, agentic workflows, and AI agents. For more information, see [ServiceNow product tiers](../intelligent-experiences/ai-native-sku-overview.md).

|Agentic workflow name|Description|Available AI agents|
|---------------------|-----------|-------------------|
|Securing custom apps with Vault agents|Proposes data classifications and available protections for a custom application.|Custom app recommendations|
|Access observer configuration|Views, creates, deactivates, and deletes Access Observer settings for a particular field.|Access observer configuration manager|
|Summarize access observer logs|Reviews and summarizes access logs for a specific field, identifying access sources, users, and their roles.|Access observer log analyzer|
|Field encryption with Vault module|Encrypts specific fields and configure secure access to users with designated roles.|Vault crypto module manager|

**Important:** Some Now Assist skills, agents, and agentic workflows are turned on by default. For more information, see [Now Assist skills, agents, and agentic workflows on by default](../intelligent-experiences/now-assist-skills/now-assist-skills-on-by-default.md).

## AI model providers

You can use Now LLM Service, Now LLM Long Term Stable models \(LTS\), Azure OpenAI, Google Gemini or Anthropic Claude on AWS as the AI model provider for all Now Assist skills and AI agents. Use the Configuration Controls in [AI Control Tower](../intelligent-experiences/ai-control-tower/ai-model-providers.md) to define which options are available, then set the skill-level preferences in the [Now Assist Admin console](../intelligent-experiences/manage-large-language-models.md). For more information, see [Large language models on the ServiceNow AI Platform®](../intelligent-experiences/servicenow-large-language-model-now-llm/exploring-large-language-models.md).

## Security

Enable security settings to run AI agents and agentic workflows using access control lists \(ACLs\) and user identities. You can configure and manage the ACLs in AI Agent Studio. See [Implement access control in Now Assist AI agents](../intelligent-experiences/aia-security-implementation.md) for more information.

## Installed agents

There might be AI agents installed with the Now Assist application that are not used in agentic workflows. To learn how to see all agents that are available to you, see [Find AI agents](../intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md).
