# Antivirus metrics

If the Antivirus Scanning plugin is activated, Antivirus Scanning runs in your instance to help protect it against virus infections from attachments.

The following metrics appear for the last 60 days of activity, and enable you to assess the effectiveness of the Antivirus Scanning functions.

## Antivirus Events

Antivirus Events indicate the number of antivirus events in your instance, by date. To access the antivirus events, navigate to **System Security** &gt; **Instance Security Center** and select the Metrics tab. Color coded graph lines represent the following types of antivirus events:
