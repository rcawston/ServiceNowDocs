# Minimize SMTP Recipient Quantity

The **glide.email.smtp.max\_recipients** specifies the maximum number of recipients the instance can list in the **To:** line for a single email notification.

The **glide.email.smtp.max\_recipients** system property specifies the maximum number of recipients the instance can list in the To: line for a single email notification. Notifications that would exceed this limit instead create duplicate email notifications addressed to a subset of the recipient list. Each email notification has the same maximum number of recipients.

Ensure that the property **glide.email.smtp.max\_recipients** is set to `100` or less.

-   Severity score: 4.9
-   CVSS rating: Medium
-   Security risk details: This can lead to resource exhaustion and potentially cause a Denial of Service \(DoS\) condition on the email subsystem or the instance itself. Limiting recipient counts is essential to prevent abuse and maintain system performance and availability.
