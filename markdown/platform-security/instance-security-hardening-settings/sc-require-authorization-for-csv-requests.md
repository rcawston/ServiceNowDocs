# Require authorization for csv requests \[Updated in Security Center 1.3\]

Use the **glide.basicauth.required.csv** property to designate if incoming CSV \(Comma-Separated Values\) requests should require basic authentication.

If the **glide.basicauth.required.csv** system property isn't set to the recommended value of **true**, then Basic Authentication for CSV format export processor is disabled. This also happens when combined with a wrong role within the guest\_user related property \(Ex: high privileged role\). This will lead to unauthenticated access to instance data.

Ensure the property **glide.basicauth.required.csv** exists in the System Properties \[sys\_properties\] table and is set to **true**.

**Warning:** This is a safe harbor property, meaning the value can't be altered once it's changed. It is non-revertible.

Security risk

</td><td>

-   Severity score: 7.5
-   CVSS rating: High
-   Security risk details: Unauthenticated access to CSV export data, when combined with misconfigured guest user role, poses a significant risk of unauthorized data exposure.

Functional impact

</td><td>

This remediation enforces a combination of authentication methods, in the form of basic authentication and system level access control.-   It performs this authentication while retrieving data from tables/pages in the form of CSV data on the instance.
-   It restricts any guest users who are currently accessing this data. If applicable, you may need to create a new account for users who need access to this content, with necessary access control permissions.
