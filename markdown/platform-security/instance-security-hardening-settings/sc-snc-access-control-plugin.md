# Enable SNC access control plugin

Activate the SNC Access Control \(com.snc.snc\_access\_control\) plugin to control access to your instances by Customer Service and Support personnel.

Prevent ServiceNow Customer Service and Support personnel from accessing the instances without your express permission by enabling the SNC Access Control \(com.snc.snc\_access\_control\) plugin. Although all access to your instance is audited, you may prefer to control this access. This access method is fully auditable and tracked.

**Note:** Other authorized ServiceNow Operations personnel, in their capacity to support and manage the product, are required to perform administrative actions on the underlying infrastructure. Enabling this plugin may affect support service levels and the Availability SLA. Availability SLA is then measured from the time that Support staff personnel are granted access to your instance.

Ensure that the SNC Access Control \(com.snc.snc\_access\_control\) plugin is activated.
