# Use Document Classification to limit publicly accessible documents \[New in Security Center 7.0\]

Control public access to permalinked documents using system properties.

**Note:** This hardening setting is not a part of the hardening baseline. It does not appear in Security Center hardening pages and affect your hardening score.

By default, the Document Management plugin includes these classifications:

-   **public**
-   **restricted**
-   **confidential**
-   **none** \(no classification provided\)

Use the **com.snc.documents.permalink.allowed\_classifications** to create a list of document classifications. Documents under these classifications \(and documents without classification\) are publicly accessible to any unauthenticated users with an appropriate link.

Use this property to control public access to document permalinks. Previously, these links were publicly accessible to anyone with the link. The value of this property depends on your specific needs. You may have additional custom document categories that may need to be added to this property to enable public access.

Set the **com.snc.documents.permalink.allowed\_classifications** property value to a comma-separated list of document classifications. Documents with these classifications are publicly accessible by unauthenticated users.

If this property isn't present in the System Properties \[sys\_properties\] table, it defaults to an empty list. In this case, only documents with no classification are publicly accessible by unauthenticated users. The default value of this property is **public**, meaning that only documents classified as **public** or documents with no classification are accessible to unauthenticated users.

If a document category containing documents which should be publicly accessible isn’t added to this property, it prevents those documents from being accessed.
