# Minimize failed login attempts for high assurance sessions

Decrease the likelihood of a brute force attack by minimizing failed login attempts for high assurance sessions.

Use the **glide.zta.high\_assurance.session.max.login.failed\_attempts** system property to limit the number of failed authentication attempts allowed before users are logged out when re-authenticating through Continuous Authentication.

Set the value of this system property to a low value \(such as 5\) to decrease the likelihood of a brute force attack.
