# Require authorization for SOAP requests

Use the **glide.basicauth.required.soap** property to designate if incoming SOAP requests should require basic authorization.

The **glide.basicauth.required.soap** system property controls whether basic authentication is required to make a SOAP request to an instance. If **glide.basicauth.required.soap** is not set to the recommended value of **true**, then unauthenticated users performing SOAP operations are mapped to the soap.guest user. This may enable an unauthenticated user to perform operations on the instance as if a logged in user to the instance. There may be additional impact if the user define within **com.glide.soap.guest\_user** is assigned additional roles.

Ensure that the property **glide.basicauth.required.soap** exists in the System Properties \[sys\_properties\] tableand is set to the value **true**. Alternatively, configure the instance for WS Security by setting the property **glide.soap.require\_ws\_security** to **true** and following the product documentation to configure WS Security Profiles. If the property does not appear in the System Properties \[sys\_properties\] table, add a new record.

**Warning:** This is a safe harbor property, meaning the value can't be altered once it's changed. It is non-revertible.

Security risk

-   CVSS rating: High
-   Security risk details: Unauthenticated access to SOAP export data, when combined with misconfigured guest user role, poses a significant risk of unauthorized data exposure.

Functional impact

</td><td>

This remediation enforces a combination of authentication methods, in the form of basic authentication and system level access control. -   It performs this authentication while retrieving data from tables/pages in the form of SOAP data on the instance.
-   It restricts any guest users who are currently accessing this data.
-   Create an account for a user who needs access to this content, with the necessary access control permissions.
