# Require Authentication on Event Management HTTP Processor \[New in Security Center 1.3, Updated in 1.5, and removed in 2.0\]

Learn how to establish secure basic authentication for inbound Amazon Simple Notification Service \(SNS\) requests when the Event Management plugin \(**com.glideapp.itom.snac**\) is enabled.

If the **glide.basicauth.required.evtmgmthttpprocessor** property isn’t set to the recommended value of **true**, and the Event Management plugin \(**com.glideapp.itom.snac**\) is active, then basic authentication is not required for all inbound Amazon Simple Notification Service \(SNS\) requests. This can lead to unauthenticated access to instance data.

To remediate this security risk, ensure that **glide.basicauth.required.evtmgmthttpprocessor** is set to**true** and that **com.glideapp.itom.snac** is active.

Functional impact

</td><td>

If **glide.basicauth.required.evtmgmthttpprocessor** is not set to the recommended value of True, and if the Event Management plugin \(com.glideapp.itom.snac\) is active, then basic authentication is not required for all Inbound Amazon Web Services SNS requests. This can lead to unauthenticated access to instance data.
