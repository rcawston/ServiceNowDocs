# Updated hardening settings for baseline version 4.0

Some hardening settings have been updated with the release of Security Center baseline version 4.0.

Baseline version 4.0 includes several updates to short descriptions for style and consistency between records. In addition, many property related scripts were also updated to improve accuracy of the default value for cases where the property has been removed from the sys\_property table.

[Require authorization for SOAP requests](sc-soap-request-authorization.md)

</td><td>

-   New technical configuration name: **glide.basicauth.required.soap, glide.soap.require\_ws\_security**
-   Old technical configuration name: **glide.basicauth.required.soap**
-   New description: The glide property **glide.basicauth.required.soap** controls whether basic authentication is required to make a SOAP request to an instance. If **glide.basicauth.required.soap** is not set to the recommended value of true, then unauthenticated users performing SOAP operations will be mapped to the soap.guest user. This may enable an unauthenticated user to perform operations on the instance as if a logged in user to the instance. There may be additional impact if the user define within **com.glide.soap.guest\_user** is assigned additional roles.
-   Old description: The glide property **glide.basicauth.required.soap** controls whether authentication is required to make a SOAP request to an instance. If **glide.basicauth.required.soap** is not set to the recommended value of true, then authentication is disable for SOAP requests on the instance. It allows unauthenticated access to administrator or maint level operations; thereby negating security controls within the instance.
-   New remediation: Ensure the property **glide.basicauth.required.soap** is set to the value true. Alternatively, configure the instance for WS Security by setting the property **glide.soap.require\_ws\_security** to true and following the product documentation to configure WS Security Profiles.
-   Old remediation: Ensure the property **glide.basicauth.required.soap** exists in the sys\_properties table and is set to true.

[Escape jelly script \[Updated in Security Center 1.3 and 1.5\]](sc-escape-jelly.md)

If **glide.ui.escape\_all\_script** is not set to the recommended value of true, then escaping of scripts injected into Jelly is disabled. Without this mitigation, the platform becomes widely open to a variety of script injection attacks. An attacker could execute arbitrary Rhino scripts on the instance.

[Prevent Users From Accepting Warning To Bypass CSRF Validation \[Updated in Security Center 1.3 and 1.5\]](sc-csrf-strict-validation.md)

</td><td>

-   New short description: Prevent Users From Accepting Warning To Bypass CSRF Validation
-   Old short description: Enforce CSRF Token Strict Validation
-   New description: This property prevents users from being able to accept a warning which allows a potentially malicious request to be sent to the instance. This warning appears when a POST request fails due to having a mis-matched anti-CSRF token belonging to one of the victim's other active sessions. If **glide.security.csrf.strict.validation.mode** is not set to the recommended value of true, then an attacker can formulate a CSRF attack utilizing a leaked anti-CSRF token from a different active session belonging to the victim.A POST request to an instance contains an anti-CSRF token within sysparm\_ck or X-UserToken which matches the user's current session. If the anti-CSRF token is instead tied to one of the user's other active sessions, the POST request will return a 302 redirection to security\_interceptor.do with a Continue button available to the user when this property is set to false. Clicking this button will re-submit the request to the instance, except it will now having a valid anti-CSRF token. When this property is set to true, the 302 redirection to the security\_interceptor.do page will not display a Continue button and the user will not be allowed to resubmit the request.A successful CSRF attack will allow an attacker to effectively perform any operation that the victim is able to perform.
-   Old description: This property enables CSRF token strict validation which prevents the reuse of CSRF tokens. If **glide.security.csrf.strict.validation.mode** is not set to the recommended value of true, then CSRF tokens could be reused which opens a door to CSRF attacks.

CSRF attacks exploit the trust a Web application has in an authenticated user. This property enables usage of a secure token to identify and validate incoming requests. This token is used to prevent cross site request forgery attacks. If **glide.security.use\_csrf\_token** is not set to the recommended value of true, then CSRF is possible.

If the value is set to false, the **glide.security.explicit\_roles.internal\_user\_blacklist** property is ignored. Misconfiguration of this propery increases the risk that an external user account gains access to internal information.

If **glide.security.explicit\_roles.enable\_internal\_user\_blacklist** is not set to the recommended value of true, and the **glide.security.explicit\_roles.internal\_user\_blacklist** property is not set to a list of untrusted user classes, then the specified roles can be assigned the snc\_internal role instead of the snc\_external role. If the list is empty, then all users will be assigned the snc\_internal role by default. The property should contain at least the default roles csm\_consumer\_user, customer\_contact.

Misconfiguration of these properties increases the risk that an external user account gains access to internal information.

[Proactively Invalidate Sessions After Defined Durations](sc-proactively-invalidate-inactive-sessions.md)

</td><td>

-   New description: The Glide Property **glide.active.session.timeout.invalidate.session** controls if a timed out session is proactively invalidated before the Tomcat container invalidates the session. When this property is not set to true, there can be a small interval of time where a timed out session is not invalidated \(60+ seconds, depending on queue size\). If a session is hijacked, an attacker may be able to utilize a session during this small period of time.
