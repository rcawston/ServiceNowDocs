# Remove credentials from Welcome page

Modify the default content on the Welcome page to remove the default credentials.

Two **How to Login** records are installed as part of the demo data for the CMS plugin.

**Note:** If you do not install the demo data for an instance, these records do not exist. In that case, the configuration is considered as Security Compliant as per the recommended security practices.
