# Limit session length for high assurance sessions

Reduce the risk of account takeover in high assurance sessions by limiting session length

Reduce the risk of account takeover in high assurance sessions by limiting the length of the session. After the specified length of time, end-users must re-authenticate.

Use the **glide.zta.high\_assurance.session.timeout** system property to set a time, in minutes, after which users must re-authenticate. The value of this property must be between 1 and 480 minutes. Consider limiting this value to 30 or lower to reduce the risk of account takeover.
