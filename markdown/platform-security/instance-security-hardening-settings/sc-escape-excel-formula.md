# Escape Excel Formulas \[Updated in Security Center 1.3\]

Use the **glide.export.escape\_formulas** property to prevent Excel Injection, also, known as formula injection.

Prevent potentially malicious formulas in programs such as Excel from being executed after exporting and opening the file by escaping formulas in these files. Excel injection occurs when websites embed untrusted entries inside Excel files. When you use a spreadsheet application such as Microsoft Excel, or LibreOffice Call, to open a file, any cells starting with +, -, =, or @ are interpreted as a formula unless properly escaped. Malicious formulas pose a risk even when the spreadsheet doesn't contain any sensitive information, as they can be used to compromise the viewer's computer through code execution.

Set the **glide.export.escape\_formulas** system property to **true** to escape these formulas from executing.
