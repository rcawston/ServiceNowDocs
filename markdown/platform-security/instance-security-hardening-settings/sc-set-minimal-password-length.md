# Require Minimum and Maximum Password Length

Set minimum and maximum password lengths to avoid compliance issues and reduce the risk of a successful brute force attack

Password policies define the requirements for passwords your users create on your instance. The password length must fall within the range accepted by the NIST 800-63B document.

Ensure that a password policy is being enforced for each password credential store in use on your instance. Ensure that the password policy mandates a minimum password length of at least 15 characters and maximum password length of at least 64 characters.

For each password credential store record in the Password Reset Credential Stores \[pwd\_cred\_store\] table:

1.  Ensure that a password policy is being enforced for each password credential store in use on your instance:

    For each password credential store record in the Password Reset Credential Stores \[pwd\_cred\_store\] table, ensure that **Enable password policy** field is activated.

2.  Ensure that the password policy mandates a minimum password length of at least 15 characters and maximum password length of at least 64 characters.

    Navigate to the Password Policy \[password\_policy\] record referenced in the record's **Password policy** field. Ensure that the **Minimum Password Length** field is set to at least 15 and **Maximum Password Length** field is set to at least 64.

3.  Further instructions on configuring a password policy can be in the documentation: [Enable password policies on your instance](../authentication/enable-password-policies.md)

Further instructions on configuring a password policy, see [Enable password policies on your instance](../authentication/enable-password-policies.md).

Security risk

</td><td>

-   Severity score: 5.9
-   CVSS score: Medium
-   Security risk details: Allowing passwords that are too short or not long enough could lead to compliance issues and increases the risk of an attacker successfully brute forcing passwords.
