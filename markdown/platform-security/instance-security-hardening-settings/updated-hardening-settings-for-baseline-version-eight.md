[Timeout Guest Sessions](sc-timeout-guest-sessions.md)

</td><td>

-   Description
    -   \(Old\)

Control the inactive session timeout for unauthenticated users with the "glide.guest.session\_timeout" system property. Raise the value of this property to extend the period of time your instance persists sessions beyond the default of 30 minutes. Avoid excessively large timeout values, which can increase the number of sessions persisted by the instance, and cause minor availability concerns.

    -   \(New\)

Use the glide.guest.session\_timeout system property to control the inactive session timeout for unauthenticated users. By default, the value of this property is 30 minutes. If there are availability concerns from persisting too many sessions in memory, the value of this property can be lowered to 5. Avoid setting this property greater than 30, as large timeout values increase the number of sessions persisted by the instance, and may cause minor availability concerns.

-   Remediation
    -   \(Old\)

Ensure the Glide Property 'glide.guest.session\_timeout' is set to a default value of 30. It may be desirable to lower this value to 5 in rare cases of availability concerns on the instance.

    -   \(New\)

Ensure the Glide Property 'glide.guest.session\_timeout' is configured to the default value of 30. In the rare case there are availability concerns from persisting too many sessions in memory, the value of this property can be lowerered to 5.

-   Security Risk
    -   \(Old\)

Large timeout values can increase the number of concurrent sessions on your instance, causing minor availability concerns.

    -   \(New\)

Avoid setting this property greater than 30. Large timeout values increase the number of sessions persisted by the instance, and may cause minor availability concerns.

-   Functional Impact
    -   \(Old\)

Small timeout values can result in an undesirable user experience as sessions expire too rapidly.

    -   \(New\)

    -   \(New\)

Activate Limit Concurrent Sessions Plugin

-   Description
    -   \(Old\) &lt;blank&gt;
    -   \(New\)

The Limit Concurrent Sessions plugin \(com.glide.limit.concurrent.sessions\) allows an administrator to limit the number of active sessions per user/role. It is recommended this plugin be enabled and configured to reduce the likelihood of session hijacking. If this plugin is enabled and configured, there will be a limit to the number of open sessions that can be hijacked.

-   Security Risk
    -   \(Old\) &lt;blank&gt;
    -   \(New\)

Higher numbers of active concurrent sessions creates security risk by increasing the attack surface for account compromise, making it harder to detect unauthorized access and enforce session accountability across devices and locations.

Proactively Invalidate Sessions After Defined Durations

-   Description
    -   \(Old\) &lt;blank&gt;
    -   \(New\)

When glide.active.session.timeout.invalidate.session isnot set to true, there's a small interval of time where a timed-out session isn't invalidated proactively before the Tomcat container invalidates the session. The duration of this time interval is dependent on additional properties representing differing use cases. glide.ui.active.session.life\_span: The value of this property defines the time, in minutes, before a UI session is invalidated. glide.guest.active.session.life\_span: The value of this property defines the time, in minutes, before a guest session is invalidated. glide.integrations.active.session.life\_span: The value of this property defines the time, in minutes, before an integrations session is invalidated.

-   Remediation
    -   \(Old\)

Ensure the Glide Property 'glide.active.session.timeout.invalidate.session' exists and is set to the value 'true'. If the property does not appear in the sys\_properties table, add a new record.

    -   \(New\)

Ensure that the property "glide.active.session.timeout.invalidate.session" is set to true.

-   Security Risk
    -   \(Old\) &lt;blank&gt;
    -   \(New\)

If a session is hijacked, an attacker may be able to use a session during this small period.

[Enable policy based session access for mobile](sc-enable-policy-based-session-access-for-mobile.md)

</td><td>

-   Description
    -   \(Old\) &lt;blank&gt;
    -   \(New\)

The Zero Trust - Policy Based Session Access plugin allows security admins to reduce user access in a session based on IP, Location, Identity provider attributes and user attributes using adaptive authentication policies. When this property is enabled \(set to 'true'\), then users logging in via mobile device will have their roles restricted as configured by the plugin policies.

-   Security Risk
    -   \(Old\) &lt;blank&gt;
    -   \(New\)

Instance admins may wish to restrict high privileged access when users login via mobile device, possible indicating an unsafe environment for sensitive operations.


</td></tr><tr><td>

[Enable work order management query rules for service organizations](sc-enable-work-order-management-query-rules.md)

</td><td>

-   Description
    -   \(Old\) &lt;blank&gt;
    -   \(New\)

When set to 'true', rules/filters from sn\_query\_rule table will be used to determine read access to Field Service Management-related tables \(Work Order and Work Order Task\) to the logged in user through query business rules and read ACLs. When 'false', the records won't be filtered based on query rules. Query business

rules add additional security validations. Specifically, this property will filter records for agents, qualifiers, and dispatchers based on their assigned territory or territory membership. It is best practice to follow the principle of least privilege when reading records.

-   Security Risk
    -   \(Old\) &lt;blank&gt;
    -   \(New\)

There may be increased risk of data exposure from Field Service Management tables.


</td></tr><tr><td>

[Disable SQL error messages](sc-disabling-sql-error-messages.md)

</td><td>

-   Description
    -   \(Old\) &lt;blank&gt;
    -   \(New\)

If "glide.db.loguser" is not set to the recommended value of "false", then sensitive server-side error messages could be displayed to end-users. Error messages can include stack traces and information about the structure of the database that could provide an attacker the knowledge needed to perform successful SQL Injection should the preconditions exist.

-   Security Risk
    -   \(Old\) &lt;blank&gt;
    -   \(New\)

Messages can include stack traces and database structure details, which attackers can leverage to craft targeted SQL injection attacks if other vulnerabilities exist. Exposing internal error information increases the risk of exploitation.

[Set guest user for soap requests](sc-set-guest-user-for-soap-requests.md)

</td><td>

-   Description
    -   \(Old\) &lt;blank&gt;
    -   \(New\)

Use the com.glide.soap.guest\_user glide property to control the access level of unauthenticated SOAP requests. If this property isn't set to the recommended value of soap.guest or is set to a user with limited privileges, then SOAP requests execute on behalf of this user.

-   Remediation
    -   \(Old\)

Ensure the property "com.glide.soap.guest\_user" is set to "soap.guest".

    -   \(New\)

Ensure the property is set to soap.guest to ensure an appropriate level of access for unauthenticated SOAP requests.

-   Security Risk
    -   \(Old\) &lt;blank&gt;
    -   \(New\)

Unauthenticated SOAP requests can allow unauthorized access if not properly restricted. Evaluating these requests against a minimally privileged user helps reduce the risk of exposing sensitive operations. Failure to enforce this control may result in elevated access and compromise system integrity.

-   Functional Impact
    -   \(Old\) &lt;blank&gt;
    -   \(New\)

SOAP requests are restricted to the permissions of the soap.guest user. If an integration relies on a resource that does not have the appropriate ACLs for soap.guest, those requests will result in permission denials.

[Required JMS connection factories](sc-required-jms-connection-factories-plugin-applicability-mid-server.md)

</td><td>

-   Description
    -   \(Old\) &lt;blank&gt;
    -   \(New\)

This property controls the Java Messaging Service \(JMS\) connection factories that the MID Server can use. It is intended for a few select factories needed by plugins for JMS activity or action. Including additional factories could be a step in a chain of attack for vulnerabilities such as JNDI insertion that rely on capabilities an attacker can leverage in allowed factories. To prevent the possibility of any leveraged vulnerability, do not include factories beyond the necessary defaults.

-   Security Risk
    -   \(Old\) &lt;blank&gt;
    -   \(New\)

Expanding the set of Java Messaging Service \(JMS\) connection factories beyond the necessary defaults introduces a significant risk because it increases the attack surface for exploitation techniques such as JNDI injection. Allowing additional factories can enable attackers to leverage insecure configurations or vulnerabilities in messaging components as part of a broader attack chain, potentially leading to remote code execution or system compromise. Restricting factories to only those required by core functionality is essential to maintain a secure posture.

-   Description
    -   \(Old\) &lt;blank&gt;
    -   \(New\)

If "glide.sg.blur\_ui\_when\_backgrounded" is not set to the recommended value of "true", then the mobile app's UI is visible when viewed from the app switcher once the app has been backgrounded.

-   Security Risk
    -   \(Old\) &lt;blank&gt;
    -   \(New\)

Blurring mobile backgrounding screenshots provides a higher level of confidentiality and privacy on the local device by blurring this view when backgrounded.


</td></tr><tr><td>

[Enforce device encryption and passcode requirements \[New in Security Center 1.3\]](sc-enforce-device-encryption-and-passcode-requirements.md)

</td><td>

-   Description
    -   \(Old\) &lt;blank&gt;
    -   \(New\)

When the Glide Property 'glide.sg.device\_encryption\_enabled' is set to true, the ServiceNow mobile app will check that device encryption is enabled and that device passcode is enabled. If encryption or passcode is not enabled, the user will not be allowed to log into the instance on mobile. This property enforces FIPS 140-2 Encryption. Mobile device encryption and passcode are important security features for ensuring an unauthorized user cannot access the content of the device even if the device is physically obtained.

-   Security Risk
    -   \(Old\) &lt;blank&gt;
    -   \(New\)

This creates a risk that sensitive data stored or accessed through the mobile app could be exposed if the device is lost, stolen, or compromised. Without encryption and passcode enforcement, unauthorized users can gain physical access to confidential information, undermining compliance with FIPS 140-2 and weakening overall data protection.

[Restrict access to GlideSystemUserSession scriptable API](sc-access-glidesystemusersession-scriptable-api.md)

</td><td>

-   Description
    -   \(Old\) &lt;blank&gt;
    -   \(New\)

The methods "gs.addErrorMessageNoSanitizationMessaging\(\)" and "gs.addInfoMessageNoSanitization\(\)" are used within the scripting environment for logging and notifications. Both of these are available in the sandbox if this property is not set to the recommended value of "false". The sandbox is a low privileged scripting environment available to unauthenticated and no role users. Both of these methods can be used to display unsanitized input to a user.

-   Security Risk
    -   \(Old\) &lt;blank&gt;
    -   \(New\)

Displaying unsanitized input to the user is dangerous, as unsanitized input may contain dangerous code that runs in the user's browser. This can be utilized for traditional reflected XSS attacks. Reflected XSS attacks can be used in multiple scenarios, including session hijacking.

[Disable GlideRecord Scope Fencing Legacy Behavior](sc-enable-gliderecord-scope-fencing-legacy-behavior.md)

</td><td>

-   Description
    -   \(Old\) &lt;blank&gt;
    -   \(New\)

GlideRecord provided cross scope create/update access to tables that were not configured with that level of access. In order to prevent customers from having applications broken when this scoped access behavior was patched, the property glide.record.legacy\_cross\_scope\_access\_policy\_in\_script was created. When 'true', cross scope access falls back onto legacy behavior \(insecure\). This property disables scope fencing, allowing scoped apps to access global script interfaces.

-   Security Risk
    -   \(Old\) &lt;blank&gt;
    -   \(New\)

It is best security practice to have scope fencing restrictions in place. Scoping ensures applications can only access resources with explicit access or within their scope, following the principle of least privilege. Disabling this feature could lead to confidentiality, availability, and integrity impacts.

An administrator can set an email property to automatically create users from incoming emails. If set this property to the insecure value, the instance will automatically create users from incoming email. Each user created will have the same hardcoded default password which makes bypassing authentication through brute force easier.

This property prevents users from being able to accept a warning which allows a potentially malicious request to be sent to the instance. This warning appears when a POST request fails due to having a mis-matched anti-CSRF token belonging to one of the victim's other active sessions. If "glide.security.csrf.strict.validation.mode" is not set to the recommended value of "true", then an attacker can formulate a CSRF attack utilizing a leaked anti-CSRF token from a different active session belonging to the victim. A POST request to an instance contains an anti-CSRF token within "sysparm\_ck" or "XUserToken" which matches the user's current session. If the anti-CSRF token is instead tied to one of the user's other active sessions, the POST request will return a 302 redirection to security\_interceptor.do with a "Continue" button available to the user when this property is set to "false". Clicking this button will re-submit the request to the instance, except it will now having a valid anti-CSRF token.

Use the glide.xml.entity.whitelist.enabled and glide.xml.entity.whitelist system properties to prevent your instance from processing XML external entities from untrusted sources. XML external entity \(XXE\) attacks occur when a malicious actor modifies incoming XML to access data or interact with otherwise restricted systems. An attacker can use the Document Type Definition \(DTD\) to include arbitrary HTTP requests that the server may execute. This could lead to additional attacks using the server's trust relationship with other entities. To help prevent these attacks, the glide.xml.entity.whitelist.enabled system property limits the sources

from which your instance executes XML. Use the glide.xml.entity.whitelist property to define a set of trusted sources. The value for "glide.xml.entity.whitelist" set to "http://java.sun.com/j2ee/dtds/" is a reference to the DTDs \(Document Type Definitions\) provided by Java EE \(formerly known as J2EE\). This URL acts as a central point where standard DTDs for XML documents are located, which define the structure and legal elements and attributes of XML documents.

Secure the images on your instance to prevent sensitive information leak. Images on your instance are accessible via urls that end in .iix. Set the glide.image\_provider.security\_enabled system property to true to prevent access to your images via these URLs. \[Note\] This property is not honored for images from the attachment table if the origin table is one of: Stationeries \[sysevent\_email\_style\] Welcome Page Sections \[sys\_home\] System Properties \[sys\_properties\]

    -   \(New\)

Use the glide.image\_provider.security\_enabled property restrict unauthenticated access to image attachments. If set to true, images are visible to any authenticated user but no unauthenticated user. If set to false, images are visible to anyone with a URL to the attachment. Thumbnails of an attached image maintain the same policy as the original attached image and are accessible to the same set of users as the original attached image. When this property is enabled, more fine grained access control for unauthenticated users is obtained through entries in the Security Allow/Deny List Entities \[sys\_security\_restricted\_list\] table and through the declaration of public KB articles for those images attached to KB articles. These exceptions to the default policy for unauthenticated users when this property is true are applied in the following order. Note in these exceptions, "parent table" refers to the table of the original image attachment from which a thumbnail is generated. 1. If the table of an attached image or parent table of a thumbnail image is deny-listed in the Security Allow/Deny List Entities \[sys\_security\_restricted\_list\] table, access is denied to the image/thumbnail. 2. If the table of an attached image or parent table of a thumbnail image is allow-listed in the Security Allow/Deny List Entities \[sys\_security\_restricted\_list\] table, access is granted to the image/thumbnail. 3. If the table of an attached image or parent table of a thumbnail image is included in a public KB article, access is granted to the image/thumbnail.

Use the glide.ip.authenticate.strict property to reduce the scope of the IP allow list of an instance and restrict the IP addresses that ServiceNow personnel can use to make inbound/outbound connections to an instance. The exact IP ranges removed from the IP allow list by this property may be adjusted over time as the

ServiceNow internal network changes. When set to true, glide.ip.authenticate.strict always guarantees an IP allow list that is equal to or more restrictive than the default. When glide.ip.authenticate.strict is set to true: A strict list of ServiceNow IP ranges replaces the default IP allow lists for inbound and outbound requests. This IP allow list, which starts with a more restrictive predefined set of allowed IP ranges, is replaced by the property glide.ip.authenticate.allow.secured.self\_hosted\_list if the instance is self-hosted. When glide.ip.authenticate.strict is set to false: The default IP allow list is used which contains a wider set of ServiceNow IP ranges. The default IP allow list is replaced by the contents of glide.ip.authenticate.allow.self\_hosted\_list if the instance is self-hosted. Note: Regardless of the value of glide.ip.authenticate.strict or if the instance is self-hosted, the allow list includes IP addresses in the glide.custom.ip.authenticate.allow and glide.custom.ip.outbound.authenticate.allow system properties, if defined. All IP list properties share the same format, which is a comma separated range of IP addresses in IPv4 or IPv6 format. IP ranges are specified using a hyphen \(10.0.10.14-10.0.10.19\), using CIDR notation \(10.0.10.0/24\), or consist of a single IP address \(10.0.10.5\). At runtime, you can make additions to the IP allow list by adding entries to the IP Address Access Controls \[ip\_access\] table. This table can also be used to explicitly deny IP ranges access to an instance.

When the com.glide.security.referrerpolicy system property is set to no-referrer-when-downgrade or unsafe-url, the referrer header of a request to a site different to the origin includes the full URL for the referring page making the request. The full referrer URL shared with external sites may include sensitive information from or about your instance. This can lead to data leakage and privacy violations. When the property is set to no-referrer, origin, or strict-origin, the referrer header is either not included, or includes only the origin portion of the referrer URL when requests are sent to the origin. This change may impede efforts to trace attack paths in the logs when a security incident occurs, as the exact origin of a request can't be determined easily. Proper configuration of this property is essential to help prevent unauthorized disclosure of internal identifiers or confidential parameters while allowing for security incident investigations.
