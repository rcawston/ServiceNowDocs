[Enable relay state in SAML requests to prevent replay attacks](sc-enable-relay-state-in-saml-requests-to-prevent-replay-attacks.md)

This relay state protects against SAML Replay attacks which could be possible in some ServiceNow instance versions if the property glide.authenticate.sso.saml2.enable\_relay\_state\_with\_id is set to false. Replay attacks allow a well-positioned attacker who has gained access to the SAML request to resubmit a valid request in orger to gain unauthorized access to the platform.

When this property is set to true, the relay state parameter contains the sys\_id of a record in the MultiSSO Request Parameters \[multisso\_request\_parameter\] table, which the relay state URL redirects to.

Set the system property glide.authenticate.sso.saml2.enable\_relay\_state\_with\_id to true. This helps prevent attackers who have gained access to a SAML request from accessing your instance by resubmitting a valid request.

    -   \(Old\)

ServiceNow instance owners are responsible for provisioning user accounts for their instance and ensuring that users can access the instance in expected ways. When a user, that is not locked out, has a valid password hash on the "sys\_user.user\_password" field, that user can perform local database authentication for both interactive and non-interactive access types. If a user is also configured to use SSO authentication, local database authentication can still occur without additional controls in place. That is, SSO users with valid local credentials may access the instance, or parts of the instance, with those local credentials.

When SSO authentication is enabled for a user, it is best practice to prevent that user from logging in locally. This reduces the chance that the valid local login credentials are stolen and used to login by a malicious user.

    -   \(New\)

Users configured to use SSO authentication may be able to access the instance, or parts of the instance, with local credentials stored in the user\_password field of their User \[sys\_user\] record. This access applies to both interactive and non-interactive access for users who aren't locked out. Help prevent SSO-configured users from using local credentials to reduce the chance that valid local login credentials are stolen and used by malicious users.

Review Now Support Knowledge Base article KB1649420 for instructions on identifying and addressing accounts with local login still enabled on an instance with SSO enabled.

[Enforce application specific ACLs only for application data](sc-enforce-application-specific-acls-only-for-application-data.md)

-   Description
    -   \(Old\)

Properties in the format 'glide.enforce\_security\_scope.' property, such as 'glide.enforce\_security\_scope.sn\_hr\_core', control the behavior of application data residing in primary tables outside the application, such as 'sys\_attachment' or 'sys\_email'. When properties in the format have a value of 'true', only the application specific ACLs are evaluated for access to the application data residing in these tables. When the properties do not have a value of 'true', the ACLs on the primary table will still be evaluated for access, potentially allowing unauthorized or undesired access to application data. Not all applications are designed to work in this configuration or ship a 'sys\_properties' record for this purpose.

The following application scopes contain this property:

        -   sn\_uni\_task

For any applications installed with the 'glide.enforce\_security\_scope.' property, such as 'glide.enforce\_security\_scope.sn\_hr\_core', in the 'sys\_properties' table, ensure the property value is set to 'true'. These properties can only be modified by the scoped administrator for the specific application.

    -   \(New\)

For each application installed with the glide.enforce\_security\_scope property in the System Properties \[sys\_properties\] table, \(for example, glide.enforce\_security\_scope.sn\_hr\_core\), ensure the property value is set to true.

These properties can only be modified by the scoped administrator for the specific application. If a sys\_properties record does not exist for the given application and respective property, it must be created.

[Prevent impersonating user from viewing application data](sc-prevent-impersonating-user-from-viewing-application-data.md)

</td><td>

-   Description
    -   \(Old\)

Properties in the format '.impersonateCheck', such as 'sn\_hr\_core.impersonateCheck', control how an impersonating user can access specific application data belonging to another user. When properties in this form are set to 'true', an admin level user impersonating another user will not be able to access the application specific data belonging to that user. Not all applications are designed to work in this configuration or ship a 'sys\_properties' record for this purpose.

A value of "false" for these properties allows an admin level user to impersonate another user and access application data with the impersonated user's access. This may be undesirable or allow for unauthorized data access in specific application contexts.

The following scopes contain this property:

        -   sn\_opp\_market
        -   sn\_jny
        -   sn\_imt\_vaccine
        -   sn\_imt\_health\_test

        -   sn\_egd\_core
        -   sn\_egd\_act
    -   \(New\)

Use system properties to prevent an impersonating user from viewing application data.

Prevent admin level from accessing the application specific data belonging to that user when impersonating an account. This permission can be set at the application level by creating a system property specific to the application.

These system properties use the .impersonateCheck naming format \(for example sn\_hr\_core.impersonateCheck\). Create a system property with a value of true to prevent users from accessing the application-specific data belonging to another user when impersonating an account.

NOTE: Not all applications are designed to work in this configuration or have a System Properties \[sys\_properties\] record for this purpose. The following scopes are configured to work with this property.

        -   sn\_opp\_market

If glide.db.clone.allow\_clone\_target is not set to the recommended value of false, then the instance can be used as a clone target, or a record that specifies the instance URL and credentials used for cloning. A system clone is when everything in a database is copied from one instance to another.

As a remediation, ensure that glide.db.clone.allow\_clone\_target is set to false.

Protect your instance from being used as a clone target by setting the glide.db.clone.allow\_clone\_target system property to false.

If "glide.security.groupby\_acl\_check" is not set to the recommended value of "True", then make sure that a table has "groupby\_acl\_check" attribute set in order to honor groupby ACLs. In other case there will be no ACLs check on groupby columns of a table. This could lead to information disclosure.

Use the glide.security.groupby\_acl\_check system property to configure your instance to conduct ACL checks on groupby columns. If this property is set to the recommended value of true, then ACLs on groupby columns are honored by default. A table's groupby\_acl\_check attribute takes precedent over the glide.security.groupby\_acl\_check property. If the property is set to false, then ensure that any table which should have ACL checks on groupby columns has the groupby\_acl\_check attribute set to true.

    -   \(Old\)

This property helps sanitize list view displaying of HTML fields. If "glide.ui.escape\_html\_list\_field" is not set to the recommended value of "true", then a malicious user can inject HTML code within the form field to execute unwanted scripts on different client/user sessions. This could potentially be leveraged by attackers to steal session information and sensitive data.

    -   \(New\)

Set glide.ui.escape\_html\_list\_field to true to prevent HTML from being rendered in HTML fields in list view. Leaving HTML sanitization inactive platform wide \(via system property\) or by field \(via a schema attribute\), may lead to XSS style attacks. XSS attacks may allow a low privileged user to hijack the session of a high privileged user or interfere in standard web application behaviors, including redirects or defacement.
