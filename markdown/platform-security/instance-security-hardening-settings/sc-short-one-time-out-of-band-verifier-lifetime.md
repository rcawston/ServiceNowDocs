# Minimize one-time out of band verifier lifetime duration \[Updated in Security Center 1.3\]

Manage the time duration for out-of-band verifiers.

An out-of-band verifier is an alternative delivery method for one-time code situations. For example, resetting a multi-factor token. If this method is enabled by administrators in the [Multi-factor authentication](../authentication/mfa-landing.md) plugin, a one-time code is delivered by email. Set one-time out-of-band verifiers to expire after 10 minutes to limit the validity window. A larger time window allows more time for the code to be compromised through illicit means such as phishing, social engineering, or shoulder-surfing attacks.
