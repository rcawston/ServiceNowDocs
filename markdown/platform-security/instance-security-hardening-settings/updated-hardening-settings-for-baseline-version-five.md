# Updated hardening settings for baseline version 5.0

Some hardening settings have been updated with the release of Security Center baseline version 5.0.

Baseline version 5 includes several updates to short descriptions for style and consistency across records. In addition, many property related scripts were updated to improve the accuracy of default values in cases where the property has been removed from the sys\_property table.

For example, downloading text/html forces an HTML file to be downloaded to the client as a file rather than viewed inline in the browser, preventing a XSS attack. XSS can lead to easily attained privilege escalation to higher roles such as admin where more lateral movement can be taken.

-   New description: When the property **com.glide.snap.infected\_download\_allowed** is set to true, users can still download non-scanned attachments in the case that the antivirus service is down or unreachable. This means it is possible that a user downloads a malicious file and risks infecting the user's desktop \(in the case there is no other endpoint protection on the device\).
-   Old description: If **com.glide.snap.infected\_download\_allowed** is not set to the recommended value of False, then it is possible to download a malicious file that has not been scanned leading to a risk of infecting the user's desktop.

[Restrict access to GlideSystemUserSession scriptable API](sc-access-glidesystemusersession-scriptable-api.md)

</td><td>

-   New description: gs.addErrorMessageNoSanitizationMessaging\(\) and gs.addInfoMessageNoSanitization\(\) are used within the scripting environment for logging and notifications. Both of these are available in the sandbox if this property is not set to the recommended value of false. The sandbox is a low privileged scripting environment available to unauthenticated and no role users. Both of these methods can be used to display unsanitized input to a user. Displaying unsanitized input to the user is dangerous, as unsanitized input may contain dangerous code that runs in the user's browser. This can be utilized for traditional reflected XSS attacks. Reflected XSS attacks can be used in multiple scenarios, including session hijacking.
-   Old description: Messaging within the glide scripting sandbox is used for logging purposes. Calling this unsanitized error function exposes the platform to reflected XSS attacks. XSS attacks can allow for easy privilege escalation by stealing someone's session cookies. If **glide.sandbox.usersession.allow\_unsanitized\_messages** is not set to the recommended value of false, then the unsanitized error messaging functions addErrorMessageNoSanitization and addInfoMessageNoSanitization are available to script.

[Enable work order management query rules for service organizations](sc-enable-work-order-management-query-rules.md)

</td><td>

-   New description: When set to true, rules/filters from sn\_query\_rule table will be used to determine read access to Field Service Management-related tables \(Work Order and Work Order Task\) to the logged in user through query business rules and read ACLs. When false, the records won't be filtered based on query rules. Query business rules add additional security validations. Specifically, this property will filter records for agents, qualifiers, and dispatchers based on their assigned territory or territory membership. It is best practice to follow the principle of least privilege when reading records. When this property is not set to true, there may be increased risk of data exposure from Field Service Management tables.

-   New description: The **sn\_ext\_usr\_reg.allowed\_email\_domains** property defines which email addresses are allowed to self-register to a ServiceNow instance. The format should be a comma separated list of acceptable email domains such as domain1.com,domain2.com where emails such as example@domain2.com will be accepted. If **sn\_ext\_usr\_reg.allowed\_email\_domains** is not set with a list of acceptable domains, then users with any email address are allowed to register accounts on the instances. If not defined, malicious actors could perform registration using emails addresses from unwanted domains to gain authenticated access to the instance.

[Apply domain separation on dot walked fields](sc-apply-domain-separation.md)

If **glide.sys.domain.include\_domain\_condition\_on\_join** is not set to the recommended value of true on an instance using domain separation, then sensitive information could be disclosed that is not to be shared with a specific domain. There may be moderate functional impact to the instance if components are reliant on the unsafe cross domain queries. Instances should be tested in subproduction environments before enabling.

-   New description: This property holds the required role to access Script Background module. If **glide.script\_processor.admin** is not set to the recommended and default value of admin, then users having a lower privileged role will be able to run background scripts on the instance. This will lead to a complete bypass of the ACL system allowing full access to tables.

[Verify certificate chain and hostname](sc-verify-certificate-chain-and-hostname.md)

</td><td>

-   New description: When the Glide Property **com.glide.communications.httpclient.verify\_hostname** is not set to the secure value of true, the hostname and certificate chain presented by remote hosts during a TLS connection initiated from the ServiceNow instance are not validated. This could compromise the security of the TLS connection and allow person-in-the-middle attacks, where communications between two parties are intercepted. This may lead to sensitive data disclosure.
-   Old description: If **com.glide.communications.httpclient.verify\_hostname** is not set to true this could allow person-in-the-middle attacks where communications between two parties are intercepted. Setting this property to an insecure value disables the certificate verification process which evaluates all certifications in the certificate chain through checking revocation status. Set this property to true to prevent the http client from connecting to a potentially harmful hostname.

-   New description: The **password\_reset.request.max\_attempt\_window** property defines the number of minutes a user must wait to reset or change their password after exceeding the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts that is set with the **password\_reset.request.max\_attempt property**. A small number of minutes for the **password\_reset.request.max\_attempt\_window** property increases the risk of successfully brute forcing a password as a greater number of password reset attempts can be made. The default of 1440 minutes is recommended.
-   Old description: If **password\_reset.request.max\_attempt\_window** is not set to the recommended value of 1440 or less, then it could be possible to perform account bruteforce as the account will not be locked after a maximum number of wrong authentication attempts.
-   New remediation: Ensure the property **password\_reset.request.max\_attempt\_window** is set to 1440 or greater.
