# Backup and recovery with ADAM

All ADAM data can be backed up using standard file system backup methods.

## Redundancy

ADAM has built-in replication utilities based on the same technology as AD. A full read and write replica of an ADAM partition can exist on the same or different computer. You can use this replica in a variety of ways to provide a fault-tolerant LDAP integration with the instance. One option is to expose both partitions to the instance through the firewall and define both servers in the LDAP Properties server field.
