# Active Directory Application Mode \(ADAM\) Access Account

The system requires a user account to read the Active Directory Application Mode \(ADAM\) object information that is imported into the application instance.

Create the account by using one of the following methods:

-   Create a local ADAM user account and assign it a password and assign permissions.
-   Assign permission to a Windows domain account on the ADAM partition.
-   Use a userProxy account.

When using ADAM as an LDAP source, you must specify the fully qualified distinguished name \(FQDN\) of the ADAM account in the instance's LDAP server's **Login distinguished name** field.
