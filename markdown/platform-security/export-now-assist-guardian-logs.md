# Export Now Assist Guardian logs

Export logs from Now Assist Guardian to get insights into how often different guardrails are being detected and used.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_generative\_ai.nsa\_admin

## About this task

Now Assist Guardian logs all three types of guardrails available. Reviewing the logs can help you determine how often offensive content is generated, prompt injection attack attempts occur, or sensitive topics are detected.

See [Now Assist Guardian](now-assist-guardian.md) for more information.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now Assist Admin** &gt; **Settings**.

2.  In the side panel, select Now Assist Guardian.

3.  Export logs for the guardrail.

## What to do next

If you do not see any log data, then it is most likely that the guardrail has not been triggered yet. If you believe you should be seeing data but aren't, reach out to Now Support.
