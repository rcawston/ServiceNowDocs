# Avoiding domain path in scripts

Domain paths can cause the values of your script to change or even break, so don't use them in scripts.

Your script should not depend on the domain path because if you ever change the domain hierarchy, the domain path recalculates and its value changes. When this happens, your scripts are useless or can throw errors or break. The best strategy is not to write your scripts based on domain paths.

Use the **sys\_domain** field in your scripts rather than depending on the domain path. If you ever change the domain hierarchy, the domain path recalculates and its value changes, which can cause your scripts to be useless, throw errors, or break. Look for base system business rules, which use the **sys\_domain** field, to get some ideas before creating your own scripts.

The ServiceNow platform does not capture the sys\_domain\_path values in an update set in order to avoid issues with differences in the domain hierarchy for each instance. Therefore, you should validate the domain hierarchy after you import an update set to ensure that the domain path values for your records are correct.
