# Service provider reference architecture

Your customers can access service provider \(SP\) services by using a portal that is designed for them to reach their domain-separated instance.

## Basic attributes of service provider reference architecture

-   You do not assign fulfillers to a domain. Instead, you share them across domains. This makes it harder to audit how many fulfillers you have per domain.
-   You can share and leverage domain administration. This means that there is no overhead and you can optimize licenses.
-   The number of users on the instance can change when you get a new customer. A new customer can result in tens or even hundreds of thousands of new users on the system. The number of total users is virtually unlimited in one shared environment.

The portal for SP services is dedicated or shared to the SP shared instance. Service providers use ServiceNow shared instances to manage their service delivery.

-   **[Service provider reference architecture decision trees](bp-ded-instance-decision-tree.md)**  
You can use decision trees and a comparison chart to determine if a new customer should be added to a shared instance or to their own dedicated instance.
-   **[Service provider reference architecture for dedicated instances](bp-sp-reference-arch-dedicated.md)**  
Service provider \(SP\) customers can access SP services by using a portal to a dedicated instance. SPs use these dedicated instances to manage their service delivery.
-   **[Service provider reference architecture for hybrid](bp-sp-reference-arch-hybrid.md)**  
Use the hybrid service provider \(SP\) reference architecture for a customized solution. Your customers require a dedicated instance for a specific service. They can still use the shared SP instance for other services, but it requires integration of each instance.
-   **[Service provider reference architecture for Service Integration Management \(SIAM\)](bp-sp-reference-arch-siam.md)**  
The Service Integration Management Service Integration and Management \(SIAM\) for service provider \(SP\) architecture integrates services for a unified customer experience.
