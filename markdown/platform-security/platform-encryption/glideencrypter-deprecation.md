# GlideEncrypter deprecation

Learn how to remove the use legacy GlideEncrypter calls from the scripts on your instance.

## GlideEncrypter availability in the Zurich release

The availability of GlideEncrypter in the Zurich release depends on whether your instance was created in or upgraded from a previous release.

-   **New instances**

    In new instances created in Zurich or later, this API turned off by default. All base system scripts have been updated and no longer use calls to this API.

-   **Upgraded instances**

    Zurich instances that have been upgraded from a previous release are still able to use the legacy GlideEncypter API, but the API has been updated to use AES256-GCM encryption via the [Key Management Framework](../encryption.md). This change replaces the use of the legacy 3DES encryption standard to comply with NIST guidelines, while allowing any scripts still using GlideEncrypter to operate.


## Enable or disable GlideEncrypter

The availability of GlideEncrypter is controlled by the **glide.security.glideencrypter.allow** system property. This system property is set to **false** by default in new Zurich instances and can’t be updated. In instances upgraded to Zurich, this property can be changed by administrators with the security\_admin role.
