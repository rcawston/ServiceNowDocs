# Configuring the Key Management Framework

Create and maintain Key Management components to customize and manage how cryptographic operations are performed on your ServiceNow instance.

-   **[Assign Key Management Framework roles](assign-kmf-roles.md)**  
Administrators with the security\_admin role can assign Key Management Framework \(KMF\) admins, who in turn can assign other Key Management Framework roles.
-   **[Configure field encryption settings to select key type](configure-field-encryption-settings.md)**  
Configure your field encryption settings to use ServiceNow supplied keys or your own customer-supplied keys \(CSK\) for encryption on the ServiceNow AI Platform.
-   **[Create a cryptographic module](create-cryptographic-module.md)**  
Create a cryptographic module to define the mechanisms used for cryptographic operations. After you create the module, you create a cryptographic specification, where you define an algorithm for encryption and generates a key.
-   **[Create a module access policy](create-module-access-policy.md)**  
Create module access policies to decide which users and scripts can access data encrypted by a cryptographic module.
-   **[Create a cryptographic module life-cycle policy](create-cryptographic-module-lifecycle-policy.md)**  
Create a cryptographic module life-cycle policy to place limits on cryptographic modules, such as how long the key is good for. Create policies to safeguard cryptographic modules by limiting their exposure.
