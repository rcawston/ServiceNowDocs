# Generate a ServiceNow cryptographic key

Follow this procedure to upload and configure a ServiceNow cryptographic key to encrypt sensitive data.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_kmf.cryptographic\_manager

## About this task

Cryptographic managers have the choice to use ServiceNow supplied keys or their own customer-supplied keys \(CSK\) for encryption on the ServiceNow AI Platform with Field Encryption Enterprise. For information on CSK, see [Configure properties for customer-supplied keys](../customer-supplied-keys.md).

## Procedure

1.  Set field encryption settings to use ServiceNow Generated Keys.

    See [Configure field encryption settings to select key type](configure-field-encryption-settings.md) for details.

2.  Navigate to **Key Management** &gt; **Cryptographic Modules** &gt; **All**.

3.  Select the corresponding cryptographic module to open the Cryptographic Module details page.

4.  Select the row for the key alias entry on the Crypto Specifications tab.

    If a key hasn’t yet been generated, the key alias field is empty.

5.  Select **Next** to navigate to the Key Origin tab of the Crypto Specification components.

    The Lifecycle Definition tab displays along with the Key Lifecycle table and can be reviewed or edited. See [Configure key lifecycle states](configure-key-lifecycle-states.md) for details.

6.  Select **Servicenow** in the Origin field.![Servicenow key origin in the crypto spec.](../image/cryptospec-sn-keyorigin.png)

    This field varies based on the field encryption settings from Step 1 and the algorithm selected. To use an imported key, see [Import the wrapping / unwrapping key pair](import-key-webservice-1.md#). See [Configure properties for customer-supplied keys](../customer-supplied-keys.md) if you’re using your own key.

7.  Enter a friendly name for the Key alias.

8.  Select **Next** to move to the Key Creation tab.

9.  Select **Generate Key**.

    After you generate the key, the Cryptographic Module form reloads displaying the cryptographic specification.

10. Select the **Module Keys** tab to view the keys.

    Secure information for the key is stored on the Module Keys tab along with the number of keys that exist for the cryptographic specification.

11. Select a key to perform key management actions.

    See [Key management actions](key-management-actions.md) for details.
