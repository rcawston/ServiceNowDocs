# IP address access control

Apply an IP access control to outbound traffic, inbound traffic, or bidirectional traffic. The system only blocks an IP address if a matching Deny rule exists and no matching Allow rule exists. By default, there are no restrictions on access to your instance.

## Before you begin

**Note:** Use the Adaptive Authentication \(AA\) pre-authentication context policy to enforce IP based authentications and restrictions for additional capabilities. For more information, see [Adaptive authentication](adaptive-authentication.md).

Role required: admin

**Warning:** IP Address Control is configured only for external IPs and it will not block internal IP addresses from ServiceNow.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Security** &gt; **IP Address Access Control** to see a list of your IP access controls.

    You might have to activate the IP Range Based Authentication \[com.snc.ipauthenticator\] plugin.

2.  Complete the form.

    **Note:** To find your instance IP information, Log in to [ServiceNow - NOW Support](https://support.servicenow.com/now), and Search for the **My IP Information** service catalog item.
