# Configure an account recovery user

Configure an account recovery user to perform account recovery activities on your instance.

An account recovery user is a user account that administrators can use to perform account recovery tasks, such as addressing an SSO misconfiguration or addressing expired certificates.

**Note:** If you are using account recovery on your instance, you must configure an account recovery user. This step is necessary before enabling multiple-provider single sign-on on an instance.

## Configure an account recovery user from the Account Recovery Properties page

Configure an account recovery from the Account Recovery properties page.

### Before you begin

Role required: sso\_config\_admin, business\_rule\_admin, script\_include\_admin

For a fresh instance to configure ACR, you must do the following:

-   Activate Mutli-SSO plugin \(`com.snc.integration.sso.multi.installer`\)
-   Enable ACR \(`glide.sso.acr.enabled`\) - This is enabled by default in case of a fresh instance.
-   Before enabling SSO property \(`glide.authenticate.multisso.enabled`\), the administrator must enroll as an ACR user.
-   Administrator must set a password for local login and register MFA before enrolling as an ACR user.

For an upgraded instance to use ACR, you must do the following:

-   Activate Mutli-SSO plugin \(`com.snc.integration.sso.multi.installer`\)
-   Enable ACR \(`glide.sso.acr.enabled`\)

    **Note:** In case of upgraded instance, the administrator must enable ACR.

-   Before enabling SSO property \(`glide.authenticate.multisso.enabled`\), the administrator must enroll as an ACR user.

    **Note:** Setting this property to false will not disable multi-provider SSO if Account Recovery \(ACR\) is also enabled on the instance. To log in with a username and password ACR must also be disabled using the **glide.sso.acr.enabled** property. For details on this property see [Account recovery properties](acr-properties.md).

-   Administrator must set a password for local login and register MFA before enrolling as an ACR user.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Account Recovery** &gt; **Properties**.

2.  Click **Enable account recovery**.

    **Note:** You need to enable account recovery when SSO is enable. Account recovery users will be limited to SSO configuration and troubleshooting-related tasks.

3.  Click the **here** text in the Step 2.
