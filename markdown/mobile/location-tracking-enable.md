# Enabling and selecting location tracking options

Learn how to enable location tracking for the Mobile Agent and select the location tracking option best suited for your users.

## Before you begin

Enable geolocation features on your instance by activating the Geolocation plugin \[com.snc.geolocation\]. The Geolocation plugin gives you access to the manual tracking option. You must purchase a subscription before activating the plugin. For details on plugin activation, see [Activate a plugin](../platform-administration/t_ActivateAPlugin.md). For more details, see [ServiceNow plugins](../platform-administration/c_ServiceNowPlugins.md).

To enable the action-based location tracking option, ensure that you have the Mobile Location Tracking plugin \[com.glide.sg.location.tracking\] installed. For more information about action-based location tracking and its settings, see [Configuring action-based location tracking](location-tracking-action-config.md).
