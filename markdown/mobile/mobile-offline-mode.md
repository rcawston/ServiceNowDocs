## Offline mode process

<table id="table_sqd_2l5_vnb"><tbody><tr><td>

Offline mode works by creating a cache of records on your mobile device that your users can view and update while offline. This cache is a limited set of data based on the applications your users can access. By default, this cache expires 48 hours after it is downloaded to a mobile device. This means that any changes your users make to the cache that are not synchronized to your instance within 48 hours are lost.

</td></tr><tr><td>

While in offline mode, only parts of the app with cached data are available. For example, if you have only enabled offline mode for tasks and inventory, all other parts of your mobile app are unavailable while offline.

When your users have network access again, they can disable offline mode and synchronize their cached data with the data on your instance. Updates between the instance and the mobile device are automatic, unless there is a conflict. Users can resolve conflicts in their outbox.

</table>## Incremental Offline

Incremental offline mode periodically compares the data on your instance and data cached on your mobile device. When the record watcher detects a difference, it triggers an update that contains only the changed files. Using this option, your users are not required to update the entire cache manually or according to a fixed schedule. These smaller updates are ideal in situations where users frequently or unexpectedly lose network connectivity.
