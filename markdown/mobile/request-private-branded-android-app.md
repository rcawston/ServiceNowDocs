# Request a new branded Android app for private distribution

Request, test, and publish a custom Android app that has your unique company identity. Then make the app available for private distribution.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

Mobile Publishing enables you to request a branded Android app that you can distribute privately. After the request form is completed and the build is successful, you can download an Android Package file \(`.apk`\), and an Android App Bundle file \(`.aab`\). You can then upload the APK and AAB files to your MDM portal or Managed Google Play account. These files can also be hosted on a website for Android users to download the application directly onto their devices.

Ensure that images or text in icons you use are at least 550 pixels from the edge to account for the rounded corners in Android icons.

![Ensure logos are 550 pixels from the edge of the image to avoid a cut off appearance.](../image/logo-padding.png)

Images that don't follow this guideline may appear cut off, as shown in this example.

## Result

After you complete the request form and submit it, your ServiceNow® instance builds the app.

To view the status of the build:

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Mobile Branding** &gt; **Manage Mobile Publishing Apps**.
2.  In **Your recent app requests** section, select the card for your branded app request to view its status on the **Request details** page.

When it completes, you receive an email notification about the status of the build.

**Note:**

-   You can only submit one build at a time. You can't submit another build until the current build is canceled, failed, or completed.
-   Privately distributed Android apps usually take less than one week to be ready for testing. In many cases these apps are ready for testing within the same day that they are requested. However, ServiceNow can't expedite the timeline because it's determined by Google.

## What to do next

After the build successfully completes and your app is ready for testing, see [Test and publish a new branded Android app for private distribution](testpubnu-andapp-privdist.md).
