# Record screen tables

Use tables in the Mobile App Builder record screen to reference child records to a parent record. These records can consist of either single reference records or multi-reference records.

Tables in a record screen are one of a few input field types. For a complete list of input field types, see [Record screen input field types](mab-record-screen-input-types.md). Tables contain reference records where you can select or create a child record that the parent record can reference. The option to select or create a reference record is predefined according to the record you select.

## Usage of Choose and New buttons in record screen tables

Each table within a record screen table displays either a **Choose** button \(![Choose button in record screen table.](../image/mab-button-choose.png)\), a **New** button \(![New button in record screen table.](../image/mab-button-new.png)\), or both buttons \(![Choose and New button in record screen table.](../image/mab-button-choose-and-new.png)\).

-   In a situation where you can only reference existing records, the **Choose** button displays.
-   In a situation when you can only create a new reference to the record you are working on, the **New** button displays.

If the **Choose** or **New** button is inactive after you make a single selection, it means that only a single record can be referenced. This is known as a single-reference record. Alternatively, when more than one selection can be made, this is a multi-reference record.

To change a single-reference record, first remove the existing reference by selecting the delete row icon \(![Delete row icon.](../image/mab-button-delete-row.png)\), then either choose or create a new reference.

For more information about working with these options, see [Create reference record entries in record screen tables](mab-record-screen-table-add-edit.md) and [Edit record reference entries in record screen tables](mab-record-screen-table-edit.md).

## UI elements in a table reference record

The Mobile App Builder table reference records contain the following UI elements.

|UI element|Function|
|----------|--------|
|![Actionable item in table reference record.](../image/mab-table-entry-blue.png)|Actionable items in a table reference record are blue. These items can be record names that open the record, remove buttons, and editable fields.|
|![Column sort button in table reference record.](../image/mab-column-sort.png)|The column sort icon is available within the header row of all tables in the Mobile App Builder. Select the column sort icon \(![Column sort icon.](../image/mab-column-sort-triangle.png)\) to list the column contents in either ascending or descending order. The black triangle indicates the sorting order for the entire table.|
|![](../image/mab-field-inline-editing.png)|You can perform inline editing in certain fields, such as the **Order** field. When performing inline editing, you change content within the table and you do not need to open the record.|
|![Delete row button.](../image/mab-button-delete-row.png)|Use the remove icon to remove an entry from the record. It does not delete the entry from the database.|
