# Screen fields

Screen fields improve the usability of your form screens. With screen fields, your users can view and edit attachments, view and complete checklist items, or display a field without a label.

When configuring a details screen, you select fields to display on your form. When you save the details screen, the instance creates a Screen Field \[sys\_sg\_screen\_field\] each selected field. You can modify these records to change the screen field type. Change the screen field type to change how your information is presented, and improve the appearance and usability of the screen for your users.

## Screen field types

<table id="table_sqv_52l_vhb"><tbody><tr><td>

**Text** Use a text screen field to display text on your form. This text can come from any field on the current record. The text field type has a **Value only** option, which displays the field without a label. In this example, the **Description** field is shown without a label.

</td><td>

</td></tr><tr><td>

**Percentage** Use a percentage screen field to display a percentage value on your form. This value comes from a field on the current record. Percentages are determined by using a decimal value. For example, a value of `0.35` displays in a percentage field as 35%. This field type has a **Value only** option, which displays the field without a label.

The file screen field gets its value from a field on the current record. The value must be the sys\_ID of an attachment \[sys\_attachment\] record on your instance that contains a PDF file.

**Date** Use a date screen field to display a date value on your form. This value comes from a date or date/time field on the current record.

**Stage** Use stage fields to display a read-only approval or completion status of requested items and services. Stage fields are displayed under the following conditions:

-   A stage field is added on a form for Requested items \[sc\_req\_item\] records.
-   A stage field is added on a form for Catalog item \[sc\_cat\_item\] records, as long the stage names and statuses are configured using one of the following flow types:
    -   Workflow Studio
    -   Workflow \[wf\_workflow\]
    -   Execution Plan \[sc\_cat\_item\_delivery\_plan\]
-   A stage field is added on a form for any other tables if the stage names and statuses are configured using Workflow \[wf\_workflow\].

</td></tr><tr><td>

**Scripts**Use the script screen field in record screens to display dynamic field values. The script runs to determine the field value before it displays in your form. The value returned by the script doesn’t replace the database value. For example, you can display translated content for dynamic variables within an email.
