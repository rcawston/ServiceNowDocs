**Note:**

-   This feature must be enabled by your administrator. To check if it is available to you, go to **Settings** and look for Device Sharing in the menu.
-   For the admin configuration topics of this feature, see [Enable multiple users to work on a shared device](multi-user-single-instance.md).

You may see the following message if the mobile app is linked to more than one ServiceNow account. Since the shared device mode only works only with a single account on a device, you must remove the additional accounts from the app.

 To remove additional accounts:

1.  Click **OK** on the message.
2.  Select **Settings** to go back to the Settings page.
3.  Select **Accounts**.
4.  If the account you want to remove is logged in, swipe on the account and select **Log out**.
5.  For accounts you want to remove, do the following:
    1.  Swipe on the account name, select **Edit** and then **Remove from list**.
    2.  Select **Remove** in the confirmation message.

**Note:** Repeat steps \(a\) and \(b\) for each account you do not need for the shared mode.

    3.  Close the Accounts page.
6.  Return to the Settings page, select **Device sharing** from the menu and select **Activate shared device** mode.
