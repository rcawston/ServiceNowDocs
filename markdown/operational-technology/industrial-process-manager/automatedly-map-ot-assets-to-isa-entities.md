# Map an individual OT device to an equipment model entity

Perform on-demand mapping of an OT device to the ISA equipment model entity for the sites that you have access to.

## Before you begin

The following plugins must be installed:

-   [Operational Technology Manager](../operational-technology-manager/operational-technology-manager.md)
-   [Industrial Process Manager](industrial-process-manager-overview.md)

Role required: sn\_ot\_amazing\_write and cmdb\_ot\_viewer

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the Industrial Workspace.

2.  Open the Industrial Workspace list view.

3.  Under the **Operational Technology \(OT\)** list module, select one of the available lists.

4.  Select the OT device that you want to map.

5.  In the OT device record, select the **More actions** ![](../../mftg-manufacturing-ot-knowledge/image/more-actions.png) icon.
