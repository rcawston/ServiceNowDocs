# Add a custom validation for devices

Customize the validation for your OT devices.

## Before you begin

The base system for the **sn\_otsm\_sgc.SGOTAssetCustomValidationExtensionPoint** extension point uses the default **sn\_otsm\_sgc.SGOTExcelStagingAssetValidationProcessor** implementation script. You can add a customized validation by creating an implementation for the extension point in the Service Graph Connector for Operational Technology \(Excel\) scope.

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Extensions Point** &gt; **Scripted Extension Points**.

2.  Select **sn\_otsm\_sgc.SGOTAssetCustomValidationExtensionPoint**.

3.  Select the **Create Implementation** related link.

    A script include is created where you can add your custom validation.

4.  To add a custom validation, refer to the following validation scenario.![Validation scenario for creating custom validations.](../image/validation-scenario.png)

5.  Select **Update**.
