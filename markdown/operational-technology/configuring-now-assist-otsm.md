# Configure Now Assist for Operational Technology Service Management \(OTSM\)

If you have the admin role, you can configure the Now Assist for Operational Technology Service Management \(OTSM\) application so that teams can use the generative AI capabilities in the Industrial Workspace for their Operational Technology \(OT\) incidents.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

Use the Now Assist Admin console to configure Now Assist for OTSM. This console contains everything that you need to install the plugins and configure the generative AI skills. For additional information, see [Overview tab in Now Assist Admin](../intelligent-experiences/configuring-now-assist.md).

**Note:** You can also set up AI Enhanced Recommended Actions for OTSM to use with Now Assist for OTSM. For more information, see [Set up AI Enhanced Recommended Actions for Operational Technology Service Management \(OTSM\)](set-up-ai-enhanced-ra-otsm.md).

**Important:** Some Now Assist skills, agents, and agentic workflows are turned on by default. For more information, see [Now Assist skills, agents, and agentic workflows on by default](../intelligent-experiences/now-assist-skills/now-assist-skills-on-by-default.md).

The following table lists the features and skills that you can access from the Now Assist Admin console.
