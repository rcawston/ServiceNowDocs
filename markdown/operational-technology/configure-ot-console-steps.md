# Configure the Discovery Console for OT

This section is an overview of the steps for installing the Discovery Console for OT.

**Note:** During the installation of the non-containerized version of Discovery Console for OT, you need to access the internet to download and install dependent third-party packages such as Mongo and RabbitMQ. The Console installation automatically installs these packages as long as there's an internet connection. After installation of the third-party packages, the internet connection is unnecessary.

## Workflow

In the ServiceNow instance, navigate to the Service Graph Connector Guided Setup page and select Get Started. In the top section, select the Download &amp; Deploy OT Discovery link. The Download &amp; Deploy OT Discovery page opens. Select **Configure** and the Downloads page opens. Download the OT component packages.

Review the steps in the installation process listed in the Installation Workflow table.
