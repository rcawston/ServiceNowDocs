    4.  Perform a quick filtration of assessments by selecting **Choose Filters**.
3.  View the assessment records by selecting the **Fully matched assessments** and **Partially matched assessments** tabs.

    1.  You can manually create vulnerable items for any assessment records that you choose. Select one or more records from the displayed list and then select **Create Vulnerable Items**.
    2.  You can ignore assessment records that you choose from the displayed list. Select one or more assessment records and then select **Ignore**. These ignored assessments are available on the **Ignored assessments** tab.
4.  On the **Ignored assessments** tab:

    1.  If you want to perform assessments on the OT devices that you have ignored previously, select **Revert**.
    2.  If you want to create vulnerable items manually for the assessments that you choose from the displayed list, select **Create Vulnerable Items**.
