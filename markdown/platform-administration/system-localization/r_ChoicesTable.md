# Choice table

The Choice \[sys\_choice\] table contains translated text for options that appear in lists.

The main fields for this table are:

-   Table: The name of the table this translation applies to.
-   Element: The name of the field this translation is used for.
-   Language: The [BCP 47](http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry) code of the language for the translated choice.
-   Value: A key that is the same for the choice in each language. For example, you could use the English label or the sequence number as the value for all languages to map them to each other.
-   Label: The label for the choice in the specified language.
-   Sequence: A number that determines in what order the option appears in the list if you don’t want to list choices alphabetically.
