# Activate country choices for users

Select from additional countries in the Next Experience language and region preferences or a user record.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

By default, you can select from only a limited list of countries in the Next Experience language and region preferences or in a User record. To allow users to select from additional countries, administrators can activate choices for the Country code field on the User \[sys\_user\] table. For more information about the Country user preference, see [Configure Next Experience language and region preferences](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/next-experience-language-preferences.md).

## Procedure

1.  In the navigation filter, enter `sys_choice.list`.

2.  From the Choices list, use the condition builder to enter the following condition statement: **\[Table\] \[is\] \[sys\_user\] AND \[Element\] \[is\] \[country\] AND \[Inactive\] \[is\] \[true\]**.

3.  Select **Run**.

4.  Select the Choice record for the country that you want to activate.

5.  From the Choice record, clear the **Inactive** option.

6.  Select **Update**.
