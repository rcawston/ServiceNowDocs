# Integration with other translation services

Enable machine translation on your instance by integrating third-party translator services with Dynamic Translation. You can configure one or more translation service providers of your choice.

Translator services are listed in the Translator Configurations \[sn\_dt\_translator\_configuration\] table. By default several third-party translators are partially preconfigured in this table. You can complete the configuration of a default translator by providing your account credentials and connections.

Alternatively, you can also create a custom spoke. In addition to your account credentials and connections, you must configure flows and any needed language code mappings for your custom translator. See [Integrate with a translation service provider](integrate-translation-service-provider.md).

Also listed in the Translator Configurations table is a default record for the **ServiceNow** translator. This translator can be used for language detection only, not for translation, so its **Mark as default for translation** check box is not selectable. This optional language detection service is included in your Dynamic Translation subscription.

**Note:** If you activate dynamic translation in the Generative AI Controller, a fully preconfigured spoke to [Microsoft Azure OEM](../../intelligent-experiences/dynamic-translation-na-ms-azure-oem.md) Translator Service is added as a row in Translator Configurations.
