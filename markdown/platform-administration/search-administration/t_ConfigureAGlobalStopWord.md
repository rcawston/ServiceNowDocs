# Configure a global stop word

Configure stop words that shouldn't be indexed by the search.

## Before you begin

Role required: ts\_admin or admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Definition** &gt; **Text Index Stop Words**.

2.  Add or remove stop words from the list.

3.  If a message appears at the top of the list, contact Technical Support to regenerate all indexes.

    You must regenerate indexes whenever words may be missing from an index. For example, if you delete, inactivate, or change an active global stop word, the word may be missing from the index. An after business rule checks these conditions and generates the notification message when index regeneration is necessary.
