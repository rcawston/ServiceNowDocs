# Zing displays search suggestions as users enter search terms

Display possible search query completions as users enter search terms.

To use the Search Suggestions application, activate the com.glide.search.suggestions plugin if it's not already installed. For information, see [Request a plugin](../t_RequestAPlugin.md) and [Activate a plugin](../t_ActivateAPlugin.md).

Once you enable Search Suggestions, suggestions appear automatically when users enter text into Zing search fields in the Service Portal or Now Mobile.

If there are any matching suggestions from the user’s own previous searches, those suggestions appear first, with a clock icon. The remaining suggestions are those suggestions coming from the searches of other users.

In the Service Portal, you can use Search Suggestions or type-ahead functionality, but not both at the same time. In Now Mobile, only Search Suggestions is available. By default, new ServiceNow instances use Search Suggestions in the Service Portal. Upgraded instances use whatever was previously enabled. You can easily enable Search Suggestions on upgraded instances. To learn more, see [Enable and disable Search Suggestions in Zing](enable-search-suggestions.md).

For full details on configuration and use of the Search Suggestions application, see [Search Suggestions](../search-suggestions/search-suggestions-overview.md).
