# Configure a table-specific stop word

You can configure stop words for a specific table.

## Before you begin

Role required: ts\_admin or admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Definition** &gt; **Text Indexes**.

2.  Open the text index entry for the table.

3.  Add or remove stop words from the **Index Stop Words** related list.

    For each word, select the desired **Stop mode** \(Not a Stop Word \(inactivates the stop word\), Neither Index nor Query, or Index but do not Query\).

4.  If a message appears at the top of the form, select **Regenerate Text Index**, then select **OK**.

    You must regenerate indexes whenever words may be missing from an index. For example, if you delete or change a stop word for which the mode was Neither Index nor Query, the word may be missing from the index. An after [Business rules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/business-rules-classic/c_BusinessRules.md) checks these conditions and generates the notification message when index regeneration is necessary.

    **Note:** Text search uses the global list plus the table-specific list of stop words when indexing the table.
