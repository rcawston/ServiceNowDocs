# Zing filters search results with access controls

Zing filters search results to only display records the user can access.

For example, suppose you index the System Property \[sys\_properties\] table. When the ITIL user searches for a term in the System Property table, Zing returns no search results because the ITIL user doesn't meet the ACL rule requirements.

When a system administrator searches for the same property, Zing returns search results from the System Property table because the administrator meets the ACL rule requirements.
