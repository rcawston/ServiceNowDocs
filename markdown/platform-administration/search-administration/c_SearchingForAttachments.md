# Zing can include attachments in search results

Search content from attachments on indexed tables. Display attachments for search results from the Knowledge \[kb\_knowledge\] table.

![Sample Knowledge search including attachments.](../../../product/knowledge-management/image/Km_search_filter_H.png "Sample Knowledge search showing attachments with matching content")

By default, search only matches content from attachments on Knowledge \[kb\_knowledge\] records. Administrators can [enable search for attachments on other tables](../t_DisablingAttachmentsOnATable.md), but doing so causes the system to re-index the selected table, its parent table, and any children of the parent table.

**Warning:** For large tables, such as the Task table, re-indexing can take several hours and slows down the system until complete. Re-indexing is best performed during non-peak times.

The search results page only displays attachments for search results from the Knowledge \[kb\_knowledge\] table, even if other tables have attachment search enabled.

![Global search results page displaying attachments for Knowledge search results but not for search results from other tables.](../image/global-search-result-attachments.png "Global search displays attachments for Knowledge search results but not for search results from other tables")

Zing supports indexing and searching these attachment file types.
