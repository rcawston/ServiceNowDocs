# Configure AI Search as the source for Ask Now Assist suggestions

Enable term highlighting in enhanced chat's Ask Now Assist suggestions by configuring AI Search as the source for those suggestions.

## Before you begin

You must have at least Now Assist in AI Search 15 installed.

Role required: admin

## About this task

By default, Ask Now Assist suggestions are generated using a prefix-based GlideAggregate query against the Utterance Suggestion \[sys\_suggested\_utterance\] table.

Admins can configure the system to use AI Search as the source for Ask Now Assist suggestions in enhanced chat. Making this change activates suggestion term highlighting in Ask Now Assist and provides improvements such as wildcard searching and lemmatization for suggestions.
