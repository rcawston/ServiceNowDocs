# Now Assist Q&amp;A Genius Results

Now Assist Q&amp;A Genius Results use the Now LLM Service to generate concise, actionable answers from knowledge article results in Service Portal, Virtual Agent, Employee Center, and global searches.

**Important:** Starting with the Now Assist in AI Search 11 release, the Now Assist Q&amp;A Genius Results feature is in maintenance mode. This feature will remain available but will not be updated or supported. Similar and improved functionality is available in the newer Now Assist Multi-Content Response Genius Results feature. For more details on this feature, see [Now Assist Multi-Content Response Genius Results](now-assist-multi-content-qna-genius-results.md).

## Now Assist Q&amp;A Genius Results overview

Now Assist Q&amp;A Genius Results send the most relevant knowledge articles from your search to the Now LLM Service, which generates answer snippets from the articles' HTML fields.

Each Now Assist Q&amp;A Genius Result answer card displays up to three generated answer snippets. For reference, the answer card also includes a link you can select to view the source knowledge articles.

The following example shows a Now Assist Q&amp;A Genius Result answer card containing a snippet summarizing a knowledge article. Select the answer card's **View article** action link to view the full knowledge article.

**Note:** Because the Now Assist Q&amp;A Genius Result answer is automatically generated, it's a good idea to review it for accuracy. You can provide feedback on the answer by selecting the thumbs-up icon ![](../image/genius-result-feedback-positive.png) if the generated answer is accurate, or the thumbs-down icon ![](../image/genius-result-feedback-negative.png) if it's not. Your feedback helps ServiceNow improve future versions of this Genius Result configuration.

Now Assist Q&amp;A Genius Results use semantic vector search and legacy keyword search to find knowledge articles that best match the meaning and intent of your search query. For more details on semantic vector search, see [Semantic vector search in AI Search](semantic-search-ais.md).

The Now Assist Q&amp;A Genius Result configuration replaces the original Q&amp;A Genius Result configuration from the base system. The base system's Q&amp;A Genius Result configuration extracts answers from knowledge articles using internal routines instead of using the Now LLM Service. To learn more about the base system's Q&amp;A Genius Result configuration, see [Q&amp;A Genius Results](genius-result-q-a-ais.md).

## Enabling Now Assist Q&amp;A Genius Results

You can enable Now Assist Q&amp;A Genius Results in your AI Search portals and mobile applications using the Now Assist in AI Search Setup module. For details on this procedure, see [Enable Now Assist Genius Results in AI Search portals and mobile applications](enable-now-assist-gr-ais-apps.md).

To use Now Assist Q&amp;A Genius Results in global search, you can enable the Now Assist Q&amp;A Genius Result configuration in the AI Search for Next Experience application. For details on this procedure, see [Enabling Now Assist Q&amp;A Genius Results](enabling-now-assist-qa-grs.md#).

**Note:** When you activate Now Assist Q&amp;A Genius Results in a search application, they're available to all users who search using that application.

## Limitations

By default, Now Assist Q&amp;A Genius Results only support English-language searches. Administrators can enable support for other languages by activating Dynamic Translation. To learn more about how content and answers are translated, see [Dynamic Translation for Now Assist Q&amp;A Genius Results](dynamic-translation-na-gr.md). For more details on Dynamic Translation, see [Dynamic Translation](../dynamic-translation/dynamic-translation-overview.md).

Knowledge articles that are boosted or promoted by result improvement rules are more likely to appear as Now Assist Q&amp;A Genius Results, but aren't guaranteed to appear.

**Note:** The Knowledge search property settings don't affect Now Assist Q&amp;A Genius Results. For more information on these settings, see [Knowledge search properties](../../servicenow-platform/knowledge-management/r_KnowledgeProperties.md).

If you have the External Content Connectors ServiceNow® Store application installed, Now Assist Q&amp;A Genius Results exclude search results retrieved from external content source systems when generating answers.

## Answer snippet creation for Now Assist Q&amp;A Genius Results

AI Search uses the Now LLM Service to create each Now Assist Q&amp;A answer snippet from a knowledge article record's HTML fields. Each Now Assist Q&amp;A answer card can include up to three snippets. These snippets may all be generated from the same source article or from different source articles.

Now LLM Service automatically determines which elements of a knowledge article's text to include in a Now Assist Q&amp;A answer snippet. You can't configure the criteria for this behavior.

The Now LLM Service summarizes and abstracts content from the knowledge articles' text fields. Answer snippets displayed on Now Assist Q&amp;A Genius Result answer cards may not exist word for word in the source records.

Both AI Search content retrieval and the Now LLM Service are continually improving, so Now Assist Q&amp;A results for specific queries may vary over time. Because results from the Now LLM Service are non-deterministic, you should expect a higher answer variability compared to the base system's Q&amp;A Genius Results.
