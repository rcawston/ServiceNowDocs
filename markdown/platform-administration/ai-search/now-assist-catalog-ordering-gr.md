# Now Assist Actions Genius Results

Now Assist Actions Genius Results display actionable answers showing Catalog Items and Virtual Agent topics that match your search query. AI Search matches records based on their similarity to your search's intent and meaning instead of looking for exact term matches.

**Important:** Starting with the Now Assist in AI Search 11 release, the Now Assist Actions Genius Results feature is in maintenance mode. This feature will have no new enhancements but will have continued support. Similar and improved functionality is available in the newer Now Assist Multi-Content Response Genius Results feature. For more details on this feature, see [Now Assist Multi-Content Response Genius Results](now-assist-multi-content-qna-genius-results.md).

Now Assist Actions Genius Results send content from your search's most relevant Catalog Item records and Virtual Agent topic records to the Now LLM Service. The Now LLM Service ranks and filters the selected records' content for display.

A Now Assist Actions Genius Result answer card can display content from up to three records. AI Search uses semantic vector search and legacy keyword search to select records that best match the meaning and intent of your search query. For more details on semantic vector search, see [Semantic vector search in AI Search](semantic-search-ais.md).

## Supported record types

In Service Portal, Now Assist Actions Genius Results only operate on Catalog Items. In Virtual Agent, Now Assist Actions Genius Results operate on Virtual Agent topics as well as on Catalog Items. To learn more about Virtual Agent topics, see [Virtual Agent](../../conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/virtual-agent-landing-page.md).

In Virtual Agent, Now Assist Actions Genius Results rank Catalog Item and Virtual Agent topic records using a unified relevancy scoring scheme. As a result, Now Assist Actions Genius Result answers may display records of either type in any order.
