# Configure and manage AI Search in search applications

Configure and manage the AI Search settings for search applications that support the AI Search engine.

## About this task

You can modify existing search application configurations, or create and configure your own search application configurations with AI Search when you specify it as the search engine. By configuring the AI Search settings for a search application, you can customize the search experience for your specific needs. To set up the AI Search configuration, you do the following tasks from the search application configuration landing page:

1.  Assign a search profile.

    -   Create a search profile.
    -   Set the search sources as a priority to define the behavior of your search application.
    For more information, see [Search profiles in AI Search](defining-search-profiles-ais.md).

2.  Define the search app configuration.

    -   Configure the search profile to customize the user interface of your search application.
    For more information, see [Search application configurations](defining-search-app-cfgs-ais.md).

3.  Test and turn on AI Search.

    -   Display the options to test and verify AI Search in your search profile.
    -   Activate or deactivate AI Search based on its configuration status.
    For more information, see [AI Search Admin console Applications page](ais-admin-console-applications.md).
