# Aha! Roadmaps external content connector

The Aha! Roadmaps external content connector retrieves Features, Goals, Ideas, Notes, and Releases from workspaces in your Aha! Roadmaps source system and makes their content and metadata searchable in AI Search applications.

Connector administrators can run or schedule content crawls to retrieve updated content and access permissions from your source system, or user permission crawls to retrieve updated security principals from your source system. Both types of crawl feed their data to AI Search for indexing.

The indexed content and metadata are stored as records in a connector-specific indexed source. Search administrators can create search sources from this indexed source and link them to search profiles to make the indexed records searchable in AI Search applications.
