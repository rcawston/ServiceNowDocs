# Get Workday task code for My Team Anniversaries

Get the task code for the My Team Anniversaries task from your Workday tenant. The Workday external content connector needs this task code to retrieve team anniversary data from the Manager hub.

## Before you begin

You need the manager role and access to the My Team Anniversaries task in your organization's Workday tenant.

Role required: none

## About this task

This task is optional. The Workday external content connector can retrieve Manager hub data from your Workday source system. If you don't want to retrieve Manager hub data from Workday, you can skip this task.

## Procedure

1.  Log in to your Workday tenant with your manager credentials.

2.  In the Workday search bar, search for the **My Team Anniversaries** task and select it.

3.  Copy the task code from the Workday URL for the My Team Anniversaries page and store it in a secure location.

    The task code is the path element between the final slash and the `.htmld` extension in the URL shown for the My Team Anniversaries page. As an example, if your My Team Anniversaries page URL is `https://impl.workday.com/example/d/task/3005$6925.htmld`, the task code is `3005$6925`.

    **Important:** Your external content connector admin needs this task code when configuring the Workday external content connector to retrieve Manager hub data.


## What to do next

Provide the task code you copied in step [3](get-workday-task-code-anniversaries.md#copy-task-code-step) to your connector admin. They need this task code to configure a Workday external content connector to retrieve Manager hub data from your Workday source system.
