# Semantic Index Field form

The Semantic Index Field form contains information about a field from an AI Search indexed source that you want to index for semantic vector search. Use this form when defining or modifying semantic index fields in a semantic index configuration.

To learn about defining and modifying semantic indexing settings for an indexed source, see [Configure semantic indexing settings for an indexed source](configure-semantic-indexing-ais.md). For details on semantic index configuration fields, see [Semantic Index Configuration form](semantic-index-configuration-form.md).

**Note:** This form is only available when the AI Search Semantic Controller plugin \(com.glide.ais.semantic\_search\) is active on your instance. To activate this plugin, your instance must have at least one [Now Assist application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/platform-now-assist-landing.md) installed.
