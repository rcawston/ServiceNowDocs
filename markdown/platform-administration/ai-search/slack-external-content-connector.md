# Slack external content connector

The Slack external content connector retrieves messages and attachments from public channels in your Slack source system and makes their content and metadata searchable in AI Search applications.

Connector administrators can run or schedule content crawls to update searchable content and metadata from your source system. Content crawls feed their data to AI Search for indexing.

The indexed content and metadata are stored as records in a connector-specific indexed source. Search administrators can create search sources from this indexed source and link them to search profiles to make the indexed records searchable in AI Search applications.
