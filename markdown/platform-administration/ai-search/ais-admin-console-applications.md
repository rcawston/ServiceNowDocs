# AI Search Admin console Applications page

The AI Search Admin console Applications page is where you monitor all the applications which use AI Search, as well as create and adjust AI Search configurations.

![AI Search Admin console Applications page with 5 callouts highlighted. For a text description, see the table that follows.](../image/ais-admin-02.png "AI Search Admin console Applications")

Each application is represented by a card on the Applications page. Each card shows the AI Search status of the application, its name, and the date when it was last modified or if its configuration isn’t started yet. Selecting a card takes you to the application's Configuration view.
