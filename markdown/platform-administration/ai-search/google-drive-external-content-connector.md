# Google Drive external content connector

The Google Drive external content connector retrieves files and attachments from eligible shared drives in your Google Drive source system and makes their content and metadata searchable in AI Search applications.

Connector administrators can run or schedule content crawls to retrieve updated content and access permissions from your source system, or user permission crawls to retrieve updated security principals from your source system. Both types of crawl feed their data to AI Search for indexing.

The indexed content and metadata are stored as records in a connector-specific indexed source. Search administrators can create search sources from this indexed source and link them to search profiles to make the indexed records searchable in AI Search applications.

## Drive eligibility

To be eligible for crawling, a shared drive must be accessible by at least one member who is a user in the Directory and who has the Manager role \(or is a member of a group with the Manager role\). To learn more about the Directory, see [https://support.google.com/a/answer/1628009](https://support.google.com/a/answer/1628009). For details on the Manager role, see [https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/12380484](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/12380484).
