# Map custom tables to a product subscription in Subscription Management

Maintain accurate entitlement for custom tables in the global scope and stay in compliance by mapping the tables to a product subscription in Subscription Management. Mapping your custom tables keeps your custom table allotment updated and helps you avoid running out of custom table entitlements.

## Before you begin

Role required: usage\_admin, sn\_sub\_man.admin, or admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the **Issues** tab in Subscription Management in one of the following ways.

    -   Navigate to **Admin** &gt; **Subscription Management** &gt; **Issues**.
    -   Navigate to **All** &gt; **Subscription Management** &gt; **Issues**.
2.  In the **Unmapped global custom tables** tab, look for custom tables that aren't mapped to a subscription.

3.  Update your entitlements by mapping one or more custom tables to a recommended product or a product of your choice.

    When possible, Subscription Management displays recommendations for product subscriptions with available custom table entitlements in the **Recommended Product** column. Subscription Management can't display product subscription recommendations for some unmapped custom tables, which therefore aren't shown in the **Unmapped custom applications** tab. For more information about mapping missing custom tables to product subscriptions, see [Map a missing custom table to a product subscription in Subscription Management](map-missing-custom-table-sub-mgt.md)
