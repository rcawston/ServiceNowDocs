# Using the Instance Scan dashboard

Compare and analyze the results of the scans in your instance by representing it on the premium Performance Analytics \(PA\) dashboard.

## Before you begin

You've created some checks to execute the full scan. See [Create a check](hs-create-health-check.md) and [Execute a full scan](hs-execute-full-scan.md) for more information.

Role required: admin.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Instance Scan** &gt; **Dashboard**.

2.  Select an option from the **Instance Scan Category** or **Instance Scan Priority** list.

    **Note:** The dashboard is applicable only for full scans. The **Instance Scan Category** appears only if you have data or a finding in the result set that are applicable to the categories.

3.  Select the scan result from the Scan Results list that generates an unexpected number of check findings.

    A related list of findings related to only that scan is expanded.
