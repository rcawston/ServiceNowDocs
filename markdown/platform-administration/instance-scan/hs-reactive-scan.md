# Execute a reactive scan

Execute a reactive scan to set up a scan that runs automatically on an execution tracker failure.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin.

## About this task

For many failed processes on your instance, you can find a corresponding record on the execution tracker. The progress window shows the status of the test. If a process fails on an execution tracker, Instance Scan can watch for that failure on the progress status and run a scan automatically.

The **Trigger Type** in the Scan Trigger form should match the **Source Table** field on the sys\_execution\_tracker record of the failed process to enable the connection between the two. For example, if the failed test is in the Update Sets list, you can set up the **Trigger Type** as sys\_update\_set. This enables Instance Scan to be connected to the execution tracker test failure.

## Procedure

1.  Enter `scan_trigger_list.do` in the navigation filter.

    A list of scan triggers shows up.

2.  Select the required trigger from the list to update it.

    **Note:** The **Trigger Type** is based off of table names. You can also create a custom trigger type in your codes.

    The reactive scan is now set up to automatically scan the execution tracker of the failed process which appears on the scan results table.
