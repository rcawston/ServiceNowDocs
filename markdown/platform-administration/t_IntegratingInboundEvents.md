# Integrate inbound events

This example illustrates how to create a notification from an inbound JSON request.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

When complete, you will be able to:

-   Send a JSON request to the \[imp\_notification\] web service import set with the JSON processor
-   Create a new import set in the \[imp\_notification\] table in the instance using data from the JSON request

The following example steps assume you have your own demonstration instance.

## Procedure

1.  Activate the JSON Web Service plugin.

2.  Install the [RESTClient](https://addons.mozilla.org/en_US/firefox/addon/restclient) Firefox plugin.

3.  Open the RESTClient.

4.  Create the following JSON request.

    -   **Method**: POST
    -   **URL**: `http://<instance name>.service-now.com/imp_notification.do?JSON`
    -   **Headers**: Authorization: Basic
    -   **Body**:

        ```
        {"sysparm_action":"insert","message":"this is an event","uuid":"abc"}
        ```
