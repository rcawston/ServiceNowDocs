# Create an assignment data lookup rule

Automatically assign a record using Data Lookup and Record Matching.

## Before you begin

Role required: assignment\_rule\_admin or admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Policy** &gt; **Rules** &gt; **Assignment Lookup Rules**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Category|The category the data lookup matches against.|
    |Subcategory|The subcategory the data lookup matches against.|
    |Configuration item|The configuration item the data lookup matches against.|
    |Location|The location the data lookup matches against.|
    |Assignment group|The assignment group to assign the incident to.|
    |Assigned to|The user to assign the incident to.|
    |Active|Option to run the rule or deactivate the rule.|
    |Order|Order in which the rule runs compared to other rules on the same table. The Data Lookup Plugin runs the rule with the lowest order and matching values.|

4.  Select **Submit**.


## Result

The rule assigns incidents to the values in the Assignment Group and Assigned To fields based on the values selected in the **Category**, **Subcategory**, **Configuration Item**, or **Location** fields. A valid assignment lookup rule requires at least one matcher field and one setter field.

## Assignment Data Lookup

In this example, the Assignment Data Lookup rule automatically assigns any incident with the Category of Inquiry/Help and Subcategory of Email to Fred Luddy.
