# Exploring ServiceNow AI Platform tables

Applications use tables and records to manage data and processes, such as Incident, Problem, and CMDB. Tables can extend other tables, creating parent tables and child tables.

## Table administration overview

The ServiceNow AI Platform® uses a table-based data structure to store and organize information. Pre-built tables are included for common IT service management \(ITSM\) processes, with their data fully importable and exportable in CSV, XML, or other formats.

## Table administration users

|User|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Administrator|Admins can create custom tables for specific business requirements, define field properties, create relationships between tables, and extend existing tables without modifying the originals. Administrators also define access controls to allow only approved user access to records, business rules for various tasks, and table cleanup policies for unused and outdated records.|

## Table administration workflow

This infographic depicts how an administrator can extend both core tables and custom tables.

![Data can be exported and imported between Core Tables and Custom Tables. Admins define access controls to restrict access.](../image/exploring-now-platform-tables.png "Extending core tables and custom Tables")

1.  An administrator views table relationships and learns how table extension works on the ServiceNow AI Platform®.
2.  The administrator creates a custom parent table and extends it by creating a custom child table.
3.  The administrator defines access controls to restrict access to each table.
4.  The administrator exports and imports data to core and custom tables as needed.
