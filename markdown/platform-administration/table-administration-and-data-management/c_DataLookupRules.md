# Data lookup rules

Data lookup rules offer a generic way to change any field value, not just assignment fields.

[Data lookup and record matching support](../c_DataLookRecMatchSupport.md) offer the following improvements over the Assignment module:

-   Ability to change any field value not just an assignment field
-   More options to define when a rule runs:
    -   On form change \(Allows assignment rules to apply to unsaved changes on a form\)
    -   On record insert
    -   On record update
-   Option to replace existing values \(including default values\)

**Note:** You can define data lookup and Assignment rules at the same time. The system ignores any duplicate rules after an incident has been assigned unless you are using a data lookup definition option to replace existing values.
