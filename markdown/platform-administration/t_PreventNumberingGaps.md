# Prevent numbering gaps

By default, numbers are generated every time a new record is created.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

When records are created but not saved, a gap in the numbering is created. You can prevent these numbering gaps by generating numbers only when records are saved.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Properties** &gt; **System**.

2.  Set the property **Assign a task number only upon insert \(prevents unused numbers\)**, **glide.itil.assign.number.on.insert**, to **true**.

    **Note:** If an insert is aborted, it still consumes a new task number, leading to gaps in the sequence.

3.  Click **Save**.
