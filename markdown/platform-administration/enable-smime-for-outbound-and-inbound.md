# Enable S/MIME

Configure S/MIME settings for inbound and outbound email.

## Enable S/MIME for Inbound and Outbound emails

You can configure email properties from the Email Properties page through the **System Mailboxes** or **System Properties** module.

Email properties are available from either of these modules:

-   **System Mailboxes** &gt; **Email Properties**
-   **System Properties** &gt; **Email Properties**

## Outbound S/MIME configuration

For encryption, you must upload the email certificate for the recipients in PEM format and the CA certificates for the issuing authority. For more information, see [Upload an email certificate](upload-email-certificate.md) and [Upload a CA certificate](upload-ca-certificate.md).

For signing, you must upload the email account key pair in P12 format. For more information, see [Import an S/MIME key pair](import-smime-key-pair.md).
