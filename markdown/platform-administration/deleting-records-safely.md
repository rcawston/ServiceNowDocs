# Deleting records safely in Core UI

Safely delete records from a table without using scripts and without deleting the table by creating and executing delete jobs.

## Overview of deleting records safely

1.  [Mark records for deletion](mark-records-for-deletion.md)

    Determine which records to delete by creating a delete job.

2.  [Preview affected records for deletion](preview-affected-records-for-deletion.md)

    Preview the affected records before you schedule or execute the job. For example, you might want to preview a set of incident records that will be deleted before you delete them.

3.  [Schedule or execute a job to delete records](schedule-execute-job-delete-records.md)

    Schedule the job to run later or execute the job immediately.

4.  [Rollback a delete job](rollback-delete-job.md)

    Use the rollback option in the delete job If you need to restore deleted records after the job has run.


If you must delete a large number of records from a table rather than a selection of records, use the table cleaner option. For details, see [Deleting older or unwanted records in Core UI](deleting-older-records.md).
