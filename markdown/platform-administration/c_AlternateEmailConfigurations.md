# Advanced email setup

With an advanced email setup, you can use your own SMTP server, POP3 server, or both.

-   Use your own SMTP server to forward email to ServiceNow servers.
-   Use your own SMTP server to send email.
-   Use your own POP3 server to receive email.
-   Use your own SMTP and POP3 servers to send and receive email.
-   Use an OAuth 2.0-enabled SMTP server to send email from a third-party service.
-   Use an OAuth 2.0-enabled IMAP server to receive email from a third-party service.
