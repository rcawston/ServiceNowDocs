# Install a Now Assist application with the Application Manager

When you install a new Now Assist application, the Application Manager uses Now Assist suites to verify compatibility with any other Now Assist applications in your instance.

## Before you begin

For domain-separated instances:

-   applications must be installed and updated from the global domain.
-   The `sys_user` table record for the user who completes the task must also be in the global domain.

Role required: admin, sn\_appclient.app\_client\_user, or sn\_appclient.app\_client\_company\_installer

**Note:** Some applications and plugins can't be uninstalled after they've been installed.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the **Available for you** tab of the Application Manager in one of the following ways.

    -   Navigate to **Admin** &gt; **Application Manager** &gt; **Available for you**
    -   Navigate to **All** &gt; **Admin Center** &gt; **Application Manager** &gt; **Available for you**.
2.  Find and select the Now Assist application you want to install.

    You can search for an application by name, or use the sort and filter options available in the Application Manager.

3.  Select **Install**.

4.  In the **Select suite version** drop-down menu, select a Now Assist suite version.

    The available suite versions are compatible with your instance. If you have other Now Assist applications already installed on your instance, they might require update for suite compatibility. For more information about Now Assist suite compatibility, see [Now Assist suite versions in the Application Manager](now-assist-suites-app-mgr.md).

    If you haven't installed a Now Assist suite version yet, you have the option to choose **none** in the version selector. This option enables you to begin using Now Assist suites at a time that works best for your organization.

5.  If you have available application customizations, use the **Customized ver.** drop-down menu to select which customization to use.

    Your customizations might not be compatible with a new application version. Update the application in a non-production instance, then make any necessary changes to your customization and validate compatibility before making updates in production instances. For more information about managing customizations, see [Manage customizations to applications](../../application-development/application-repository-self-hosted/manage-customizations-store-apps.md).

6.  Include demo data if it's desired and available.

    1.  Select the option to install demo data next to each Now Assist application you want demo data for.

        The option to install demo data isn't available for all applications.

    2.  Turn on the **Load demo data for selected apps** toggle switch.

7.  Select **Continue** to review the installation details.

    If any applications display "Installation blocked," it means that application version isn't licensed yet. Either uninstall the application or license the required version. For more information, see [App installation blocked when installing or updating Now Assist suite](app-installation-blocked.md).

8.  Install the application now or schedule installation for a later time.

Scheduled version installations begin at the chosen date and time.
