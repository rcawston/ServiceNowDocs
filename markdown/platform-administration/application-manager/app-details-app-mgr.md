# Application Manager application details

The details page in the Application Manager displays key information about applications, plugins, or products that are installed or available to install.

When you select an application, plugin, or product the details page is displayed.

For an application, this page includes the following:

-   Application state indicators, if applicable
-   Application summary
-   Version selector
-   Compatibilities
-   Key features
-   Release notes
-   Technical details such as system requirements and dependencies

For a plugin or product, this page shows a summary of the plugin or product's function and its dependencies.

The application details page for Now Assist applications includes a Now Assist suite version selector instead of an application version selector. For more information about Now Assist suites, see [Now Assist suite versions in the Application Manager](now-assist-suites-app-mgr.md).
