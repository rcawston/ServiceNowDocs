# Scripting for email notifications

Use mail scripts to add business rule-like scripting to outbound email messages.

Mail scripts enable you to dynamically change the email output of your system based on different criteria. You can use them for simple tasks, such as displaying incident data, and for complex ones, such as running advanced database queries.

To reuse a script across multiple email notifications or templates, add an `${mail_script:script name}` embedded script tag to the body of the email notification or template, replacing `script name` with the name of the script you created.

When you manually enter a mail script enclosed in `<mail_script>` and `</mail_script>` tags in the body of a new or converted email notification or template and save the record, a message asks whether to convert the mail script. Often, an unconverted mail script fails to run from inside the HTML editor. If you select **Yes**, the script is added to the Email Script \[sys\_script\_email\] table and is automatically replaced in the body with an embedded script tag \(`${mail_script:script_name}`\).

If you enter a mail script inside `${{mail_script:script name}}` and the HTML sanitizer is configured, the output of the mail script is HTML sanitized. For more information about HTML sanitizer, see [HTML Sanitizer.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/c_HTMLSanitizer.md)
