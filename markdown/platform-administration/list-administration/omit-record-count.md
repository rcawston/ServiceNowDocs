# Omit record count in a list

Speed up how fast lists load by removing the calculation of the total number of records in a list.

## Before you begin

Role required: workspace\_admin

## About this task

Calculating the total number of records included in a list that's filtered from large tables can take a long time. Platform displays the total number of records in the list.

To load lists faster, you can remove the page calculation for all or only specified filtered lists. When you remove the calculation, the total record count is not displayed and the Last Page icon \(![Forward arrows](../image/double-arrow-forward.jpg)\) is grayed out.

## Procedure

2.  Right-click a header in the list and navigate to **Configure** &gt; **List Control**.
