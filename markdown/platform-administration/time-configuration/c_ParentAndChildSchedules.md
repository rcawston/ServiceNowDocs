# Parent and child schedules

Schedules can have one of two parent-child relationships with other schedules.

-   **Parent field**

    When a schedule record lists a value for the **Parent** field, schedule entries from the parent schedule apply to both the parent schedule and the child schedule. By default, there are no sample schedules that use the **Parent** field.

-   **Child schedule**

    When a schedule record has one or more child schedules in the **Child Schedules** related list, schedule entries from the child schedule apply to the containing schedule. By default, there are several sample schedules that use child schedules. For example, see the **8-5 weekdays excluding holidays** schedule that includes the **U.S. Holidays** schedule.


Parent and child schedules cannot contain conflicting schedule entry types. For example, a schedule containing maintenance schedule entries cannot also contain blackout schedule entries. Nor can a maintenance schedule have a child schedule containing blackout schedule entries.

**Note:** To create a Holiday schedule and include it in a parent schedule, you must add it as a child schedule and with an Include type.

Parent schedules must have at least one entry that is not an **Excluded** type. If parent schedules are only exclusionary, they are invalid.

**Note:** The **Show Schedule** related link shows schedule entries from the current schedule and the child schedule record. For example, when showing the **8-5 weekdays excluding holidays** schedule, holidays are also shown as excluded because the holiday schedule is a child schedule.
