# Holidays

You can define each individual holiday as a schedule entry to create exceptions to existing schedules.

For instance, if an SLA requires an incident be resolved within three business days excluding Christmas, create a schedule entry for Christmas. Creating this entry ensures that the SLAs do not count Christmas when calculating elapsed time, even if it falls within the work week.

Because schedules can be included in other schedules through a parent-child relationship, it is also possible to create a holiday schedule and include it in other schedules to keep holidays consistent. The following example shows a holiday schedule.
