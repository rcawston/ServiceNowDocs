# Advanced options for scheduled jobs

Advanced scheduling options are available when configuring Scheduled Jobs in **sysauto**, offering greater flexibility in job planning and execution. You can configure jobs to start on a future date, end on a particular date, and define how the job should repeat.

An **Advanced** check box is available on the following Run types in **sysauto**:

-   **Daily**: Runs daily, at a designated time.
-   \***Day and Month in Year**: Runs yearly on a specific day and month \(for example, July 14\), at a designated time.
-   \***Day in Week in Month in Year**: Runs yearly on a specific day of the week in a specific week of a specific month \(for example, the second Monday in October\), at a designated time.
-   **Monthly**: Runs on a monthly basis, at a designated time and day of the month.
-   **Periodically**: Runs on a designated repeating interval.
-   **Week in Month**: Runs monthly during a specific week of the month \(for example, the third week of each month\), on designated days and at a designated time.
-   **Weekly**: Runs on a weekly basis, at a designated time and day of the week.

**Note:** \*For **Day and Month in Year** and **Day in Week in Month in Year**, only the advanced options **Starting** and **Ending** are available \(not **Repeat every**\).

After selecting the **Advanced** check box, additional configuration fields will appear:

-   **Starting**: Allows you to define when in the future you would like your job to start running.
-   **Ending**: Allows you to define when in the future you would like your job to stop running.
-   **Repeat every**: Enables custom recurrence patterns- for example, a daily job that repeats every two days or a weekly job that repeats every three weeks

If the **Time zone** field is set, the **Starting** and **Ending** fields use that time zone.

To further understand the options; **Starting**, **Ending**, and **Repeat every**:

Let's say you create a **daily** job with the following schedule:

-   **Starting**: June 1 at 00:00
-   **Ending**: June 30 at 23:59
-   **Time**: 9:00 AM
-   **Repeat every**: 1 day

Although the job is scheduled to start on June 1 at 00:00, it won’t run at that time. Instead, the job will first run at 9:00 AM on June 1, because that is the specified run time.

The **Starting** and **Ending** times define the window of time during which the job is set to run. The first valid scheduled run within that window- in this case, 9:00 AM on June 1, is when the job will run. When creating scheduled job records, if the value of **Starting** is empty, the system will use the current time.

If you change the **Repeat every** setting to 2, the job will run every 2 days, at 9:00 AM, starting June 1. That means it will run on June 1, June 3, June 5, and so on, continuing every other day until June 29 \(the last occurrence before the **Ending** time of June 30 at 23:59\).
