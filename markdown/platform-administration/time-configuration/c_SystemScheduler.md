# System scheduler

The System Scheduler application contains two separate engines for scheduling: the Scheduled Jobs engine and the Schedules engine.

## Scheduled jobs

Scheduled Jobs executes any work that must be performed at a specific time, or on a recurring basis. The Scheduled Jobs module links to the Schedule \[sys\_trigger\] table. Manipulating records on the Schedule table is not recommended. Use this table to view existing base system scheduled jobs.

The Scheduled Jobs module in System Definition is an admin-friendly interface for scheduling work. Use this module to create new scheduled jobs. For more information, see [Create a Scheduled Job](t_CreateAScheduledJob.md).

## Schedules

Schedules are rules that include or exclude time on a calendar. They are used by service levels, inactivity monitor, and group on-call rotation. For instance, you can define a schedule to restrict service levels to only apply to weekdays during business hours. You can also exclude holidays from an on-call rotation.

For more information, see [Use Schedules](c_UseSchedules.md).
