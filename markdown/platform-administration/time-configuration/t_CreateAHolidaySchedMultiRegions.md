# Create a holiday schedule for multiple regions

You can create holiday schedules for multiple regions that follow the same work schedule but have different holidays.

## About this task

The following method supports multiple regions with the same work schedule \(for example, an 8-5 weekdays schedule\) but with different holiday schedules.

## Procedure

1.  Create a holiday schedule for each region. For example, U.S. Holidays, British Holidays, and Australian Holidays.

2.  Add the work schedule as a child schedule to each region's holiday schedule.

    This method requires making &lt;number of schedules&gt; + 1 total schedules. If you make the regional holiday schedule a child schedule of the work hours schedule, you must create a separate work hours schedule for each region. The total number of schedules in this case is &lt;number of schedules&gt; x two schedules.
