# Technology Product Support record page

The Technology product support record page provides a simplified case view in CSM Configurable Workspace that enables agents to research and resolve technology cases.

![The Technology product support record page enables agents to focus on case details, the activity stream, and information in the contextual side panel.](../image/tech-product-support-record-page.png "Technology product support record page")

The Technology product support record page focuses on the essential functionality that agents need:

-   Looking up and verifying customer information
-   Scanning the activity stream
-   Viewing related information
-   Searching for knowledge articles

The Technology product support record page is included with the Technology Product Support Case application \(sn\_tech\_product\_support\).

## Modeless dialogs

The Technology product support record page uses modeless dialogs to create comments, work notes, and email messages. The following actions are available from the **Compose** button in the form header:

-   **Compose &gt; Comment**: Opens the Compose a comment modeless dialog.
-   **Compose &gt; Work note**: Opens the Compose a work note modeless dialog.
-   **Compose &gt; Email**: Opens the Compose email modeless dialog.

The following rules apply to modeless dialog visibility:

-   One modeless dialog of each type \(comment, work note, or email\) can be active at a time.
-   One modeless dialog can displayed at a time while the other two are minimized.
-   Minimized modeless dialogs appear in the In-progress Actions menu in the action bar. This menu displays a badge that shows the number of minimized modeless dialogs.
-   If an agent opens a second modeless dialog while the first modeless dialog is displayed, the system minimizes the first modeless dialog.

Agents can do the following:

-   Select the In-progress Actions menu to see a list of minimized modeless dialogs. Each entry in the list includes the title and category of the minimized item.
    -   For email, the title is the email subject.
    -   For comments and work notes, the title is the first line of text.
-   Select an item from the list to open the minimized modeless dialog.

Closure behavior for comments, work notes, and email:

-   Posting a comment or work note to the activity stream closes the modeless dialog.
-   Saving the record posts a comment or work note to the activity stream closes the modeless dialog.
-   Sending an email closes the modeless dialog. The system adds the email to the activity stream and to the Emails related list.

Discard behavior for comments and work notes:

-   Closing a work note or comment modeless dialog discards the text. The system displays a Close Dialog pop-up window and asks the agent to confirm the action.
    -   Selecting **Continue** confirms the action, discards the text, and closes the window.
    -   Selecting **Cancel** or the Close Dialog button cancels the action. The modeless dialog remains open and the text remains in the dialog.
-   The text is discarded in the modeless dialog and on the form field.

Agents can use response templates from the contextual side panel to copy text into the modeless dialogs.

Agents can apply templates to emails in a modeless dialog:

-   Select a template from the Email Templates tab in the contextual side panel and then select **Apply Template**. The contents of the template is added to the modeless dialog.
-   If a modeless dialog is minimized, display the dialog before applying the template.

Agents can also toggle the **Rich text editor** button in the email modeless dialog to show or hide the TinyMCE formatter.

For more information, see [Modeless dialogs](../../customer-service-management/csm-front-line-case-page-modeless-dialogs.md).

## Account and contact lookup components

The account and contact lookup components enable agents to do the following:

-   Look up an account or contact by name, phone number, or email address. As the agent types characters in the search box, matching information appears in record cards below the search box.
-   Select an account or contact after searching by selecting the desired record card. The selected record card replaces the lookup component.
-   Create a new account or contact by selecting the **+** icon on the lookup component, filling in the fields for the account or contact, and selecting **Save**. A record card for the new account or contact replaces the lookup component.

Agents can perform the following actions from a record card:

-   Remove a linked account or contact from a case record by selecting the more actions icon and then selecting **Unlink**. Then save the form to apply this change.
-   Edit and save a linked account or contact record by selecting the pencil icon, editing the information for the account or contact, and selecting **Save**.
-   Select a reference field on a lookup card to open the referenced record in a subtab.
-   Select an email address on a lookup card to open the email composer in a subtab.
-   Select a phone number on a lookup card to make a phone call.

## Case summarization component

The case summarization component provides agents with a summary of a customer service case, including the issue and the actions taken. Agents can generate summaries to understand the case context and post summaries to the case work notes.

The case summarization component appears above the activity stream on the Technology product support record page variant. Upon first opening a case, the component is collapsed and in the default state.

Using this component, agents can:

-   Select **Summarize** to create a summary of the case details.
-   Select **Share to work notes** to copy the summary text to the activity stream.
    -   Review the summary text in the Share to work notes pop-up window and modify the text as needed.
    -   Select **Save to work notes** on the pop-up window to add the text to the activity stream.
-   Select the refresh icon in the component footer to refresh the text and get the latest summary.

**Note:** If the case doesn’t contain enough text to summarize, the system displays the following message: "This case doesn't have the minimum number of words required for summarization yet."

To use the case summarization component with the Technology product support record page variant, activate the Now Assist for Customer Service Management \(CSM\) application and configure the case summarization skill in the Now Assist Admin console. For more information, see:

-   [Activate Now Assist for Customer Service Management \(CSM\)](../../customer-service-management/now-assist-for-csm/now-assist-csm-supporting-info.md)
-   [Configure the case summarization skill in the Now Assist Admin console](../../customer-service-management/now-assist-for-csm/now-assist-csm-configuring.md).

## Activity stream component

The activity stream component displays a list of the activities occurring on a case record. The activities in the list can be collapsed or expanded. When collapsed, the agent can quickly scan the list to get an overview of case activities. When expanded, the agent can see detailed information on individual activities.

![The technology product support record page activity stream component lists record activities in a collapsed or expanded format and uses tiles to represent the activity types.](../image/front-line-case-page-activity-stream.png "Technology product support record page activity stream component")

The activities in the activity stream are represented by tiles that use icons and colors to indicate the activity type:

-   Comment
-   Work note
-   Attachment
-   Field change
-   Email sent or email received
-   Chat discussion

When collapsed, each activity in the list includes:

-   A tile that represents the activity type.
-   The name of the user responsible for the activity.
-   A brief one-line summary of the activity.
-   A badge that indicates if an activity is internal or external.
-   A relative timestamp.
-   An expand button that the agent can use to see a detailed summary of the activity.

When expanded, each activity also includes:

-   A full date and timestamp.
-   An action label that describes the type of activity.
-   For comments and work notes, the full text of the comment or work note.
-   For field updates, the field name and the updated field value.
-   For emails, detailed message information.
-   For attachments, a small preview of the attached file.
-   For chats, a sidebar chat card.

The activity stream uses [modeless dialogs](tech-product-support-record-page.md#modeless-dialogs) for composing comments, work notes, and emails. Use the **Compose** button in the action bar to create these items.

-   **Compose &gt; Comment**: Opens the Compose a comment modeless dialog.
