# Technology Product Support case type

The Technology Product Support case type enables technology companies to provide support for digital products and services.

<table id="table_xsy_fcl_y1c"><thead><tr><th>

SLA type

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

First Response Time - P2 \(8 Hours\)First Response Time - P3-P4 \(2 Days\)

</td><td>

The first response time is the time between the customer submitting a case and receiving a response.The first response time is defined by case priority.

-   P2 cases: response time is 8 business hours.
-   P3 and P4 cases: response time is 2 business days.

This SLA is fulfilled when the customer receives a response in one of the following ways:

-   The agent updates the **First response** field.
-   The agent posts a comment in the activity stream.
-   The agent uses the **Compose Email** action to send an email.

For the playbook experience, this SLA is fulfilled when the initial response is posted in the activity stream.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Ongoing Response Time - P2 \(8 Hours\)Ongoing Response Time - P3-P4 \(2 Days\)

</td><td>

The ongoing response time begins after the first response time SLA is fulfilled and continues until the agent sends the next update to the customer.The ongoing response time SLA is defined by case priority:

-   P2: response time is 8 business hours.
-   P3 and P4: response time is 2 business days.

ThIs SLA is fulfilled when the agent updates the additional comments in the activity stream. Once completed, the ongoing response SLA is reset and the default ongoing response is applied again.

This SLA is paused when the case is in the Awaiting Info state and is restarted when the customer responds to the request for information.

This SLA is stopped when the agent proposes a solution for a case. If the customer rejects the solution and the case moves back to work in progress, a new ORT SLA instance is started.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Case Resolution - P2 \(14 days\)Case Resolution - P3-P4 \(28 days\)

</td><td>

The resolution time is the maximum amount of time in which a customer can expect a solution to be provided. This is the time between the customer submitting a case and accepting a solution \(or a case being automatically closed\).The case resolution SLA is defined by case priority:

-   P2: resolution time 14 days.
-   P3 and P4: resolution time is 28 days.

This SLA is paused when the case is in the Awaiting Info state and is restarted when the customer responds to the request for information.

This SLA is stopped when the agent proposes a solution for a case. If the customer rejects the solution and the case moves back to work in progress, this SLA resumes.

</td></tr></tbody>

</table>## Case action status

The case action status feature enables agents to easily identify cases that need attention. Visual indicators in the **Action status** column on case lists highlight case status.

-   A blue indicator highlights cases that need attention, such as cases that have been updated by customers or internal users and are waiting for input or review.
-   A red indicator highlights cases that are blocked, such as cases that have open related task records or are waiting for customer feedback.

In addition to the colored indicators, the **Action status** column also displays a brief status message, such as Needs Attention.

When a case is in the Awaiting Info state and the customer, or a customer contact who has access to the case, responds to the request for information:

-   The **Action status** field is updated to Customer Responded.
-   The **Needs attention** field is enabled.

For more information, see the following topics:

-   [Administering case action status](../../customer-service-management/customer-service-case-action-status.md)
-   [Case action status](../../customer-service-management/case-action-status-csm-workspace.md) \(CSM Configurable Workspace\)
