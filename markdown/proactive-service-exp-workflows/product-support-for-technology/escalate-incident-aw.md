# Escalate an incident in Proactive Service Experience Workflows

Escalate an incident to continue the investigation and diagnosis of that incident. By escalating an incident, you can ask for help from a more-experienced resource so that the issue is resolved more quickly.

## Before you begin

This task assumes that you have been working on an incident and you must escalate it to the next escalation group.

**Note:** Be sure that the administrator has assigned this role to the escalation groups. For information about how administrators assign roles, see [Assign a role to a group](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/user-administration/t_AssignRoleToGroup.md).

Role required: sn\_ind\_tsm\_core.noc\_agent

## Procedure

1.  In the Service Operations Workspace, navigate to **List** &gt; **Incidents** &gt; **Open** and select an incident.

2.  On the incident record form, from the drop-down list at the top-right corner, select **Escalate**.

3.  In the Capture notes for the escalation pop-up window, enter a descriptive note and select **Escalate**.

    This action triggers the subflow for the next level of escalation group, and the Assignment Group automatically changes to the next escalation group.


## Result

-   The state of the incident task for the previous engineer is set to Closed Complete and the work note is logged.
-   An incident task is created for the newly assigned user with the state set to Work in Progress.
-   A work note in the activity stream provides instructions for the engineer at this level of escalation.
-   The incident Stage is updated with the next escalation level.
-   The Assignment Group is updated according to the escalation level.
