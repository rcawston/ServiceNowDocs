# Auto-creation of cases and updates from incidents

Cases are created from the incidents.

A case is designated as a major case based on the value specified in the `major_case_affected_account_threshold` system property. This value can be modified by the administrator.

For more information to generate proactive cases, see [Redirection to the right case type](generate-proactive-cases.md).

Depending on the threshold value, different flows are triggered to either create one major incident, or several individual cases. The case record is then populated. For example, in minor case scenarios, the following information is populated:

-   Short description
-   Description
-   Proactive is true
-   Channel
-   Incident
-   Account field

The administrator can specify the fields that must be passed to the case records from the parent incident record to suit their business needs.
