# Technology Product Support Case playbook stages and activities

The Technology Product Support Case playbook includes stages and activities that assist agents in researching and resolving technology cases.

When an agent creates a technology product support case, the system opens a service selector modal and displays the services defined for the Technology Product Support case type.

The agent selects a service and then selects **Create** to create a case. The system creates the case and launches the Technology Product Support Case playbook. This playbook includes the stages and activities described in the following sections.

## Intake stage

During the intake stage, an agent gathers information about the customer, the issue, and the impacted instances.![Intake stage.](../image/tech-product-support-case-intake.png)
