# Diagnose and resolve a change request

As a customer service agent, review, diagnose, resolve, and close a change request for the service-related issue experienced by the customer.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ind\_tsm\_sdwan.PSEW\_USER

## About this task

The change request progresses through several stages from start to closure. It begins with a PSEW user reviewing and verifying the problem. Next is the diagnosis tab, where system-specified tests are executed to identify the root cause. After the tests, the agent moves to the repair, creating a task to fix the identified issue. The PSEW user follows the instructions in the repair task to address the problem areas. Once the repair is complete, the change request is retested to confirm that the issue is resolved. Finally, the change request is resolved and closed based on the customer's feedback on the provided solution.

## Procedure

2.  Select the List icon.

3.  Navigate to **Changes** &gt; **Assigned to me**.
