## About this task

The Telecom core application is installed with Proactive Service Experience Workflows:

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  Find the Proactive Service Experience Workflows application \(sn\_ind\_tsm\_sdwan\) using the filter criteria and search bar.

    You can search for the application by its name or ID. If you can't find the application, you may have to request it from the ServiceNow Store.

    Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/store-release-notes/page/release-notes/store/sn-store-release-notes.html).

3.  In the Application installation dialog box, review the application dependencies.

    All dependent plugins and applications that are included, or must be installed are listed in the dialog box.

4.  If demo data is available and you want to install it, select **Load demo data**.

    Demo data comprises sample records that describe application features for common use cases. Load demo data when you first install the application on a development or test instance.

    **Important:** If you don't load the demo data during installation, it's unavailable to load later.

5.  Select **Install**.
