# Technology Product Support Case playbook

The Technology Product Support Case playbook provides step-by-step guidance for resolving technology cases.

![The Technology product support case playbook enables agents to focus on the contact and account information, the playbook stages and activities, and information in the contextual side panel.](../image/tech-product-support-playbook-page.png "Technology Product Support Case playbook")

A playbook visualizes a workflow in a simple, task-oriented view and guides the agent through sequences of tasks.

-   A stage in a playbook is a grouped sequence of activities.
-   An activity in a stage represents an individual task for an agent to complete. Stages can also include automated activities, such as sending a notification to a customer when a stage or activity is complete.

The **Technology product support process page** provides access to the playbook in CSM Configurable Workspace.

For detailed information about the stages and activities, see [Technology product support case playbook stages and activities](tech-product-support-playbook-stages.md).

## Technology product support process page variant

The Technology product support process page variant is included with the Technology Product Support Case application \(sn\_tech\_product\_support\). A page variant is a version of a page that has unique settings. This page variant includes the following settings.

-   If a list has more than five items, it includes a **Show more** option.

## Modeless dialogs

The Technology product support playbook uses modeless dialogs to create comments, work notes, and email messages. The following actions are available from the **Compose** button in the form header:

-   **Compose &gt; Comment**: opens the Compose a comment modeless dialog.
-   **Compose &gt; Work note**: opens the Compose a work note modeless dialog.
-   **Compose &gt; Email**: opens the Compose email modeless dialog.

The following rules apply to modeless dialog visibility:

-   One modeless dialog of each type \(comment, work note, or email\) can be active at a time.
-   One modeless dialog can displayed at a time while the other two are minimized.
-   Minimized modeless dialogs appear in the In-progress Actions menu in the action bar. This menu displays a badge that shows the number of minimized modeless dialogs.
-   If an agent opens a second modeless dialog while the first modeless dialog is displayed, the system minimizes the first modeless dialog.

Agents can do the following:

-   Select the In-progress Actions menu to see a list of minimized modeless dialogs. Each entry in the list includes the title and category of the minimized item.
    -   For email, the title is the email subject.
    -   For comments and work notes, the title is the first line of text.
-   Select an item from the list to open the minimized modeless dialog.

Closure behavior for comments, work notes, and email:

-   Posting a comment or work note to the activity stream closes the modeless dialog.
-   Saving the record posts a comment or work note to the activity stream closes the modeless dialog.
-   Sending an email closes the modeless dialog. The system adds the email to the activity stream and to the Emails related list.

Discard behavior for comments and work notes:

-   Closing a work note or comment modeless dialog discards the text. The system displays a Close Dialog pop-up window and asks the agent to confirm the action.
    -   Selecting **Continue** confirms the action, discards the text, and closes the window.
    -   Selecting **Cancel** or the Close Dialog button cancels the action. The modeless dialog remains open and the text remains in the dialog.
-   The text is discarded in the modeless dialog and on the form field.

Agents can use response templates from the contextual side panel to copy text into the modeless dialogs.

Agents can apply templates to emails in a modeless dialog:

-   Select a template from the Email Templates tab in the contextual side panel and then select **Apply Template**. The contents of the template is added to the modeless dialog.
-   If a modeless dialog is minimized, display the dialog before applying the template.

Agents can also toggle the **Rich text editor** button in the email modeless dialog to show or hide the TinyMCE formatter.

For more information, see [Modeless dialogs](../../customer-service-management/csm-front-line-case-page-modeless-dialogs.md).

## Update action plans

Agents can update a case action plan multiple times during the case resolution process. For example, an agent can update the plan before transferring the case to another agent.

The Related work activity in the Troubleshoot stage of the playbook includes an **Update action plan** declarative action that the agent can use to make updates. Selecting this action takes the agent back to the Update action plan activity. After updating the plan and selecting **Save**, the system posts the action plan to the activity stream and returns the agent to the Related Work activity.

A new filter set \(Action Plan\) is available in the activity stream. Agents can use this filter set to view only the action plan fields.

## Creating a case

Agents can create a technology product support case by selecting **Create case** from the More Actions menu in the action bar.

Creating a case opens a service selector modal and displays the services defined for the Technology Product Support case type. From this modal, agents can:

-   Search for a service.
-   Select a service.
-   Select **Create case**.

The system creates the case and launches the playbook associated with the service definition. For more information, see [Associate a playbook with a service definition](../../customer-service-management/service-def-associate-playbook.md).

**Note:** This action is active by default for the Technology product support process page.

## Using Now Assist for CSM to generate resolution notes for a case

Agents can automatically generate the resolution notes for a case by using the resolution notes generation skill in the Now Assist for Customer Service Management \(CSM\) application.

When the playbook transitions to the Resolve stage, the resolution notes generation skill adds the information to the **Resolution notes** field in the Propose resolution activity.

**Note:** The resolution notes generation skill requires a minimum of 200 words in the case record to generate the resolution notes. If the resolution notes cannot be generated, the system displays a message below the **Resolution notes** field.

To use the resolution notes generation skill with the Technology product support process page variant:

1.  [Activate Now Assist for Customer Service Management \(CSM\)](../../customer-service-management/now-assist-for-csm/now-assist-csm-supporting-info.md).
2.  [Configure the resolution notes generation skill in the Now Assist Admin console](../../customer-service-management/now-assist-for-csm/now-assist-csm-configuring.md).
