Automated email notifications are triggered at key release life cycle events. Notifications are sent to relevant stakeholders when:

-   A phase reaches its end date
-   A release task is 2 days from its due date
-   The release is 1 day from its readiness target
-   A phase's state changes
-   A policy is executed and resulted in non-compliant

2.  Review the risk score for the current phase on the Release overview dashboard.

    The risk score of timeline-oriented releases combines overdue task scores and policy failure scores, weighted by their respective importance. For more information, see [Risk score for timeline-oriented releases](dpr-risk-score-release.md#).

3.  Update a release phase.

    1.  From the timeline, select a phase or use the arrow buttons to navigate to the previous or next phase.

    2.  When all tasks in the current phase are complete and mapped policies comply, mark the phase as complete by selecting **Complete phase**.

        **Note:** If any of the mapped policies is noncompliant, you can complete a phase only when you have any of the roles defined in the system property **sn\_dpr.complete\_phase\_override**.

        The state of the current phase is updated to Completed and the next phase is started. The actual end date of the current phase is updated to the current date.

4.  Add a task to a release phase.

    1.  From the timeline, select a phase or use the arrow buttons to navigate to the previous or next phase.

    2.  Select **Add task**.

    3.  On the Create task dialog box, add details for the task like its name, phase it belongs to, end date, and description.

    4.  If the task needs approval, perform the following steps:

        **Note:** You can select whether the task needs approval when creating it. This option can’t be changed after it’s saved.

        1.  Select **Yes** in the **Need approval** field.

            The **Assigned to** and **Approval definition** fields appear.

        2.  From the **Assigned to** list, select the user who would approve the task.
        3.  From the **Approval definition** list, select an approval definition to trigger the approval based on the predefined condition.
    5.  Select **Create task**.

    The task is created in the Pending state andadded to the selected phase.

    For an approval task, an approval record is created for the approvers to review and act.An email notification is also sent to them. For more information, see [Approve or reject a release task](dpr-approve-reject-release-task.md).

5.  Track and manage the progress of tasks for the selected phase.

    1.  From the timeline, select a phase or use the arrow buttons to navigate to the previous or next phase.

    2.  Select the **Tasks** tab to view all tasks in the phase.

        You can apply filters to view specific tasks or change the view type by selecting the **Kanban** or **List** option.

    3.  Select a task to open in the Task details pane.

    4.  Review the task in the Task details pane, or select **Full details** to open the task record in the form view.

    5.  Assign the task in the **Assigned to** field to the user who will work on it.

    6.  Review the approval status for an approval task in the **Approval** field.

    7.  Update the **State** field with the status of the task that doesn't need any approval.

        The state of an approval task is automatically updated when approved.

    8.  Select **Save** to save the changes.

        If you complete the current task and the system property **sn\_dpr.sequential\_task\_execution** is set to true, the next task in the order moves to the Open state.

6.  Manage mapping of policies to a release phase to validate it.

    1.  From the timeline, select a phase or use the arrow buttons to navigate to the previous or next phase.

        **Note:** Policies can’t be mapped to a completed or cancelled phase.

    2.  Select the **Policies** tab.

    3.  To map a policy to the selected phase,

        1.  Select **Add**.
        2.  On the Map Policies dialog box, select one or more policies from the list to map to the phase.
        3.  Select **Map policies**.
        The selected policies are mapped to the phase and are listed in the Policy Mappings list.

    4.  To delete an existing policy mapping,

        1.  Select the policies from the Policy Mappings list.
        2.  Select **Delete**, and confirm.
        Selected policies mappings are removed from the phase.

        **Note:** For an in-progress phase, if you remove a previously executed policy, the remaining policies are automatically run after its removal. The updated execution statuses of the individual policies are aggregated and shown in the **Policy status** field on the **Details** tab.

7.  Select **Run policies** to run policies on the current phase.

    All mapped policies are executed in the background for the current phase \(**In Progress** state\). You can check the execution status by refreshing the list on the **Policies** tab.

    A scheduled job runs daily to execute the policies that are mapped to the phase. The Execution status column on the Policies list for each phase is updated to show the compliance status after each run.

    When multiple policies are mapped to a phase, their execution statuses are aggregated into the phase's overall status. You can view this aggregated status in the **Policy status** field on the **Details** tab.

8.  If a policy fails compliance, you can request an exception with justification.

    **Note:** This option is only available when both Digital Product Release and GRC: Policy and Compliance Management are installed.

    1.  Select the policy that failed.

    2.  Select Request exception.

    3.  In the Request policy exception, provide the reason, start date, end date, and business justification for the exception.

    The exception request is sent to the Compliance group. For more information about the review and approval of exception request, see [Review the policy exception and extension request](../../governance-risk-compliance/grc-compliance-management-workspace/review-policy-ext-and-extension-req-ws.md) and [Manage policy exceptions and extensions](../../governance-risk-compliance/grc-compliance-management-workspace/manage-policy-exceptions-ws.md).

    After the exception is approved, the policy status shows as Compliant with exception in subsequent executions. The phase can be completed if all other policies are compliant.

9.  Add or update key dates in a timeline-oriented release that should be in relation to the release target date.
