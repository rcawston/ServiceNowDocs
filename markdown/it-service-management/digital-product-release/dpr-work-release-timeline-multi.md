# Work on a timeline-oriented release for multiple products

Monitor and work on a release that follows the timeline-oriented release process for multiple products.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_dpr\_model.product\_manager or sn\_dpr\_model.release\_admin

## About this task

When working on a release for multiple products, you can choose to work with the main release \(for the primary product or service\) or a specific release \(for an Included product\). The main release controls and executes all activities for each product release under it.

-   Perform primary activities, like starting the release and managing phases and tasks in the main release.
-   Define the release scope and manage change requests in each product release.
-   Run policies for the current phase either from the main release level or an individual product release. The policy statuses from the individual product releases are aggregated into the policy status of the main release. For more information about how the aggregated status is derived, see [Policy status aggregation in a multi-product release](dpr-policy-status-aggregation.md).

You can monitor the progress of an individual product release, or you can track the overall progress at the main release level.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Digital Product Release Workspace**.

2.  Select the releases icon \(![Releases icon.](../image/dpr-icon-release.png)\).

3.  Select a release from the list to open.

4.  Select the **Details** tab and add or update the schedule in the **Schedule** list to account for holidays during the release period.

    The list shows schedule entries that are of the type Excluded from the Schedule \[cmn\_schedule\] table.

    **Note:** The selected schedule must be within the release duration \(release target date\).

    The phase start and end dates are updated and the release duration is recalculated by considering the non-working days in the schedule. For more information on how schedules impact the dates of phases and release target, see [Holiday schedules in a release](dpr-release-holiday-schedule.md).

5.  If the release isn't in progress, select **Start release**.

6.  Select **Dashboard** to monitor the overall status of the release, see the details and all products that have their individual releases.

    -   Select the **Release dashboard** tab to view important dates of the release, release tasks, policies, related tasks, and approvals by their state for all releases together.

        For more information, see [Release dashboard for a multi-product release](dpr-release-dashboard-multi.md).

    -   Select the **Details** tab to make any necessary changes to the release details, such as the release name, owner, status, or description. For more information, see [Review and update release details](dpr-work-release-details.md).
    -   Select the **Products** tab to view a list of all products, including their release versions and statuses.
7.  In the **Products** tab, add or remove a product from the release as the scope and requirements of the release evolve.

    For more information, see [Add a product to a multi-product release](dpr-add-product-release.md) and [Remove a product from a multi-product release](dpr-remove-product-release.md).

8.  Select a product or service to work on its release from the **View by** drop-down list.

    Based on the selected option, you can see different sections as follows:
