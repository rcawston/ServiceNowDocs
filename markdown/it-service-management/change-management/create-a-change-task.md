# Create a change task

You can create change tasks for a change request. A change task is a piece of work related to the change request. For example, there can be tasks to plan the change, implement the change, and test, and review the work.

## Before you begin

Role required: itil, admin, or sn\_change\_write

## About this task

Change tasks can be created manually or from a workflow. The Change Request form has a **Change Tasks** related list, which includes all manual and workflow change tasks. From this related list, you can edit existing tasks or create tasks. Workflow change tasks are generated automatically in **Review** task type.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Change** &gt; **Open**.

    **Note:** If the UI16 module link redirection feature is enabled in Service Operations Workspace \(SOW\) and the UI16 module supports the redirect configuration, navigating through UI16 paths automatically redirects you to the equivalent list or record pages in SOW instead of displaying the UI16 forms or lists. For more information, see [Redirect UI16 module links to Service Operations Workspace](../service-operations-workspace/redirect-ui16-module-links-sow.md).

2.  Select the change request to add a change task.
