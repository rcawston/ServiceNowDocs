# Unauthorized change properties

Use the Unauthorized Change Properties page to enable or disable the unauthorized change capability, and to configure the criteria for additional unauthorized change properties.

From this properties page, you can control the capabilities, such as:

-   Enabling or disabling the creation of unauthorized change requests when receiving the **ci.change.unplanned** event.
-   Configuring the type of change requests, which are valid, and fall into the unauthorized change category.
-   Configuring a quiet time, whereby, if there is a repeated change to a CI that has been flagged previously, another unauthorized change is not created within that time period.
-   Configuring the interval frequency for detection.
-   Including a CI class for the change request that must be monitored.

    **Note:** Monitored CIs must be part of an application service.


Navigate to **Change** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Unauthorized Change Properties** to view and edit the properties.
