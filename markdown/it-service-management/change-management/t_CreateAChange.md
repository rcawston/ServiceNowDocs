# Create a change request

Create a change request to implement a controlled process for modifying approved and supported configuration items \(CIs\).

## Before you begin

Role required: itil, admin, or sn\_change\_write

## About this task

A change request records the detailed information about the change, such as the reason of the change, the priority, the risk, the type of change, and the change category.

If you use conflict detection, the planned start and end dates and the configuration item \(CI\) are required.

**Note:** If the UI16 module link redirection feature is enabled in Service Operations Workspace \(SOW\) and the UI16 module supports the redirect configuration, navigating through UI16 paths automatically redirects you to the equivalent list or record pages in SOW instead of displaying the UI16 forms or lists. For more information, see [Redirect UI16 module links to Service Operations Workspace](../service-operations-workspace/redirect-ui16-module-links-sow.md).

## Procedure

1.  Create the change request with one of these options.

<table id="choicetable_agp_ckc_3t"><tbody><tr><td id="d183328e99">

</td><td>

You can create all three types of change from the **Change** module.1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Change** &gt; **Create New**.
2.  Select **Normal**, **Emergency**, or **Standard** changes.
 If you're an upgrade customer and willing to use change models, you must enable the change model properties. For information on change models and its properties, see [Change models](change-models.md).

 When you enable the change model properties, you see the following tabs when you navigate to **All** &gt; **Change** &gt; **Create New**.

 -   **Models**: Shows all the available models available to select.
-   **Preapproved**: List of preapproved models to select.
-   **Pinned**: Models that you have pinned from the **Models** and **Preapproved** tabs.
-   **All**: All models are available to select.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d183328e222">

</td><td>

If the administrator enabled the change request copy option, you can create a new change by copying an existing change record.1.  Open the change record that you want to copy.
2.  Select **Copy Change**.
 **Note:** If the create task workflow sets the **create\_from** field in the \[change\_task\] table to **workflow**, manually created tasks from the existing change record are copied.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d183328e252">

**From a change template**

</td><td>
