# Legacy: Change Velocity dashboard

Use this dashboard to track the average duration of change requests in the last 30 days.

**Important:**

Starting in Xanadu release, the Change dashboard is deprecated. Users can use [Change dashboard](../change.md) to view, and track the open changes.

The Change Velocity dashboard is divided into the following tabs for effective usage. The ServiceNow® Performance Analytics capability in the Change Velocity dashboard provides the following benefits:

-   The **Current Pipeline** tab provides insights into current change activity. The **Historical Pipeline** tab provides details on trends and patterns associated with the change management process flow. The **Process KPIs** tab represents a modern set of Change KPIs that are used to evaluate the change process.

-   The **Process Optimization** tab provides change activity assessments that are based on the state model. This capability is available only with an ITSM Enterprise subscription. For more information, see [Process Mining](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/process-mining/process-mining.md).

## Change Velocity dashboard indicators

-   **Change Velocity**

    Average amount of time that changes have been waiting for approval in the last 30 days. To generate this data on the dashboard, you must run the Change velocity historical data collection job. For information on how to run this job see, [Collect historical data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/t_RunHistoricalDataCollection.md).

-   **Top Change Success Performers**

    Performance of assignment groups in processing the change request with the highest performer on the top. For information on how the performance score is calculated, see [Success Score Calculation](change-score-calculation.md).

-   **Average age of open changes**

    Average amount of time that the change request has been open.

-   **Average close time of changes**

    Average amount of time that it has taken to close the change request.

-   **Average implementation time of closed changes**

    Average amount of time between the start and close date of the change request.
