# Change models

Change managers can use the Change models feature to conveniently tailor change activities and flows for specific use cases.

This feature is an extension to the existing IT Infrastructure Library \(ITIL\) Change types and workflows. You can use it to transit to fit-for-purpose models and ServiceNow® Workflow Studio without compromising on existing capabilities.

Change models enable you to define:

-   Fit-for-purpose state models
-   State transitions
-   State transition conditions

By default, the following models are provided as examples for ITIL mode 1 and mode 2 processes. These models are available with the activation of the Change Management - Change Model Foundation Data \(com.snc.change\_management.change\_model.foundation\) plugin.

-   ITIL mode 1 - This is a traditional and sequential approach to process the Change Requests. This mode goes through a sequential process defined to complete a change successfully.
-   ITIL mode 2 - This is an adaptable approach to expedite the change request. This mode supports the right process for a give change to ensure a Change isn't a blocker to another change.
