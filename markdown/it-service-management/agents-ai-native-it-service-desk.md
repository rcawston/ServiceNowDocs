|Agentic workflow|Description|
|----------------|-----------|
|Investigate and resolve ITSM incidents|Provides recommendations to resolve an incident based on the incident number. Checks for related catalog items, Knowledge articles, and similar resolved incidents to generate resolution steps for the incident. For information about this agentic workflow, see [IT Service Management AI agent collection Investigate and resolve ITSM incidents agentic workflow](now-assist-for-it-service-management-itsm/now-assist-itsm-aiagents-incident-resolver-workflow.md).|
|Triage and categorize ITSM incidents|Assigns incident categories and subcategories based on its short description. After categorizing the incident, assigns the service, service offering, and configuration item \(CI\) related to the incident.
