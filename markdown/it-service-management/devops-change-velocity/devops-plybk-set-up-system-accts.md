# Set up integration user account in DevOps Change Velocity

Set up the integration user account to enable integrating with your third-party tools.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

**Important:** This setup is required only when DevOps Config is installed, and for Rally and Split tool integrations. For all other tool integrations or if you’re using only DevOps Change Velocity, you can skip this procedure.

This is a one-time setup. You can set the integration user password either using Workspace or Classic UI.

The DevOps integration user is the ServiceNow system user that your third-party orchestration tools use to send data to DevOps Change Velocity.

The default integration user credential will be applicable for all the tools. However, if you want to set up separate integration user credential per tool connection you can also do the same but ensure that the user account has the sn\_devops.integration role assigned.

## Procedure

1.  Set the integration user password in one of the following ways.
