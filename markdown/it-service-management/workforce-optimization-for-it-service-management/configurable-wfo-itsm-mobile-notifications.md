# Notifications in ITSM Mobile Agent for Workforce Optimization for ITSM

Receive notifications when you manage shift-swap and time-off requests. Enable notifications for the actions that are most relevant to you. For example, get notified when you receive a request for approval from an agent who wants to swap shifts with a peer.

As a Workforce Optimization for ITSM agent \(sn\_shift\_planning.agent\) and a Workforce Optimization for ITSM manager \(sn\_wfo\_cfg\_ws.manager\), you can enable or disable notifications for shift-swap and time-off requests and approvals. Agents can request a shift-swap with their peers and get approval from their manager. They can also request approval for time-off from their managers.

You must set your notification preferences in your desktop application to receive the notifications in your ITSM Mobile Agent application.

To enable the notifications:

1.  On your desktop application instance, click the gear icon ![Gear icon](../image/gear-icon.png) in the top-right corner. The **System Settings** screen appears.
2.  Click **Notifications**.
3.  Enable **Allow Notifications**.
4.  In the **Notifications Category** section, click **Mobile - Shift Planning**.
5.  Enable the desired notification.
