Add an event category. Create or update field configurations for events. You can also specify if an event category must be excluded when the shift coverage for agents is calculated.

The following event category configurations are available by default:

-   Work
-   Meeting
-   Training
-   Custom Event
-   Time Off
-   Break

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workforce Optimization for ITSM** &gt; **Scheduling** &gt; **Event Categories**.

2.  In the **Event Categories** list, click **New**.

3.  In the **Name** field, enter a name for the event category.

4.  If you want to exclude this event category for agent coverage calculation, enable the **Exclude from coverage** check box.

5.  In the **Event field configuration** dialog box, edit the following configuration as needed:

    **Note:**

    -   You can remove any property that does not apply to a type of event.
