# Customize a Workforce Optimization for ITSM page using the Next Experience UI Builder

Clone an existing Workforce Optimization for ITSM page and customize it based on your needs using the Next Experience UI Builder.

## Before you begin

Role required: workspace\_admin or ui\_builder\_admin

## About this task

All Workforce Optimization for ITSM Next Experience UI Builder pages and page variants are read-only. You can copy a page variant and then customize it. You can create a page variant from scratch or use a page template. For more information, see [Create a variant of a page](../../application-development/ui-builder/create-variant.md).

**Note:** After you copy and customize a page variant, any automatic updates applied to the original read-only page variant will not be applied to the page variant that you have customized.

To open your configurable workspace experience in UI Builder, see [Open a Configurable Workspace experience in UI Builder](../../platform-user-interface/open-your-configurable-workspace-experience-in-ui-builder.md)

For a list of all workspaces ServiceNow offers to target specific users, see [List of workspaces](../../platform-user-interface/list-of-workspaces.md).
