# Configure an event load order in Workforce Optimization for ITSM

Add a system property to display your preferred event categories first on the calendar.

## Before you begin

Set the map application scope to **Shift Planning**. For information on how to set the scope, see [Set map application scope](../../platform-user-interface/set-map-application-scope.md).

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  In the application navigator, enter `sys_properties.list`.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  Enter the following field values.

<table id="table_yfh_h3p_f4b"><thead><tr><th>
