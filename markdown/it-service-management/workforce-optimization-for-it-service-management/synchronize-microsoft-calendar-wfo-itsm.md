# Set up the Workforce Optimization for ITSM agent calendar integration with their Microsoft Outlook calendar

Display the schedules, shifts, and events from the agent's calendar also in their Microsoft Outlook calendar when you synchronize both the calendars.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Set up the [Microsoft Exchange Online spoke](../../integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-ms-exch-ol.md).

    **Note:** Verify that the following Microsoft Graph permissions are set correctly in the Microsoft Azure portal:

    |Permission|Type|Description|
    |----------|----|-----------|
    |Calendars.ReadWrite|Delegated|Full access to user calendars|
    |Calendars.ReadWrite.Shared|Delegated|Read and write access to user and shared calendars|
    |Calendars.ReadWrite|Application|Read and write access to calendars in all mailboxes|

2.  Set the **sn\_wfo\_outlook.enable\_outlook\_sync** system property to **true**.

    For more information, see [Scheduling components in Workforce Optimization for ITSM](configurable-wfo-itsm-scheduling-reference.md).

3.  Add the email IDs of the users that you want to synchronize to the User \[sys\_user\] table.

    Your agents' Workforce Optimization for ITSM calendar is now synchronized with their Microsoft Outlook calendar.

    **Important:** If the swapped shifts don't appear in the Microsoft Outlook calendar, verify that you've followed all steps in this procedure to make sure that the schedule for the shifts have been synchronized with Microsoft Outlook.
