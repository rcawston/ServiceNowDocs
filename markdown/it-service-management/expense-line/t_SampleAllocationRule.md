# Create a sample allocation rule

You can create a sample expense allocation rule that allocates the cost of an incident to the department of the caller.

## Before you begin

To use expense allocation rules, activate the Cost Management application.

Role required: admin, financial\_mgmt\_admin, or financial\_mgmt\_user

## Procedure

1.  **Costs** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Expense Allocation Rules**

2.  Click **New**.

3.  In **Name**, enter `Incident Caller Department`.

4.  In **Table**, select **Incident**.

5.  In **Allocation field**, click the control, expand the **Caller** element, and select a department.

6.  In **Percentage**, enter `100` to allocate all the expense to the caller's department.

7.  Select the **Active** check box.

8.  Click **Submit**.

    After an incident expense line is created, the allocation rule processes the expense line and generates an expense allocation linking the expense and amount to the caller's department. The expense is stored in the **Target** field on the Expense Allocation record.
