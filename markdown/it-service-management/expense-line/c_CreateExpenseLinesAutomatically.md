# Automatic expense line creation

You can automatically create expense lines to facilitate the accurate reporting of expenses.

If enabled, the following processes generate expense lines automatically.

-   Active CI rate cards are processed monthly to generate expense lines for each CI in the rate card. If a CI relationship is changed, existing expense lines are not affected. Changes are reflected in the next scheduled expense line.
-   Active distribution costs are processed monthly to generate expense lines based on distribution rule targets.
-   Closed tasks on task rate cards are processed to generate expense lines.

Expense lines can also be imported from external systems or generated from scripts. To generate an expense from a server-side script, use the ExpenseLine API.
