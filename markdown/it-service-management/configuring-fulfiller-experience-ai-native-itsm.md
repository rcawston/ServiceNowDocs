# Configuring the fulfiller experience in Simplified IT Service Management

Enable an AI-first fulfiller experience for simplified incident and request management.

The following experiences are available after configuring the fulfiller experience:

-   Simplified fulfiller experience with a unified record view and AI-embedded workflows.
-   Improved triage and resolution of incidents by leveraging historical resolution patterns to inform decision-making, thereby enabling service desk agents to focus on resolving complex issues.

For information about available AI agents for fulfiller configurations, see [AI agents and agentic workflows in Simplified IT Service Management](agents-ai-native-it-service-desk.md).

## Incident Management

It enables you to restore normal service operations while minimizing the impact on business operations and maintaining quality.
