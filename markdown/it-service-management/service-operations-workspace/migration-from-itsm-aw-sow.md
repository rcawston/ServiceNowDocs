# Migration from ITSM Agent Workspace to Service Operations Workspace for ITSM

You can easily migrate common customizations and configurations for various features from ITSM Agent Workspace to Service Operations Workspace for ITSM using the on-screen migration utility. With this migration, you won't have to rebuild these features in Service Operations Workspace for ITSM. For these features, you can migrate any specific record types and elements or all of them.

## Migration process

**Important:** You should run the migration in your non-production instance. If the migration to SOW for ITSM works as expected in the non-production instance, you can move the migration changes to a production instance using an update set.

Migrate from ITSM Agent Workspace 

Perform the following steps in your non-production instance.

1.  Install the Migration Utility for Service Operations Workspace application. See [Install the Migration Utility for Service Operations Workspace](install-migration-utility-for-sow.md).
2.  If you have any custom ITSM table that should be migrated, specify the table in the **sn\_sow\_migration.itsm\_aw\_migration\_tables** system property for migrating the associated list category and modules, list actions, related list actions and New record menu items from ITSM Agent Workspace to Service Operations Workspace for ITSM. See [Configure the migration of a custom ITSM table from ITSM Agent Workspace to Service Operations Workspace for ITSM](configure-migration-custom-table-to-sow-itsm.md).
3.  Create a basic authentication configuration \(sys\_auth\_profile\_basic\) to authenticate the Table API that the migration utility uses to perform creation, updating, and deletion of records. See [Create a basic authentication configuration to migrate from ITSM Agent Workspace to Service Operations Workspace for ITSM](create-basic-authentication-credential-sow-migration.md).
4.  Create an update set to record any changes that are made to Service Operations Workspace for ITSM during the migration. See [Create and select an update set as the current set](../../application-development/system-update-sets/create-select-update-set.md).
5.  Migrate from ITSM Agent Workspace to Service Operations Workspace for ITSM using the migration utility. See [Migrate from ITSM Agent Workspace to Service Operations Workspace for ITSM](migrate-itsm-agent-workspace-to-sow.md).
6.  If the migration to Service Operations Workspace for ITSM is working as expected in your non-production instance, move your migration changes to a production instance using the update set.

**Note:** The logged in admin user credentials must match the credential used to setup basic authentication to successfully perform the migration from ITSM Agent Workspace to Service Operations Workspace for ITSM.
