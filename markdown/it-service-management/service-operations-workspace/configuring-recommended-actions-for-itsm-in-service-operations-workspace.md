# Configuring Recommended Actions for ITSM in Service Operations Workspace

IT Service Management \(ITSM\) includes the following base system components used to configure Recommended Actions for various records in the Service Operations Workspace, including Incident, Incident Tasks, Problem, Problem Tasks, Change Request, Change Request Task, Interaction, and Request.

## Contexts in Recommended Actions for ITSM

 A context enables agents to see recommendations for a specific type of record when certain rules are met. These recommendations can help agents by suggesting actions to take based on the record context.  For more information, see [Contexts in Recommended Actions](../../customer-service-management/ra-csm-contexts.md).

The ITSM base system ships the following contexts:

-   Incident
-   Incident task
-   Problem
-   Problem task
-   Change request
-   Change task
-   Interaction
-   Request

For more information about the field description of this context, see [Contexts in Recommended Actions for ITSM](contexts-in-recommended-actions-for-itsm.md).

**Note:** Recommended Actions have now introduced a context for the Interaction table.

To get the correct Recommended Actions context, you must set up the **Context Sys ID** property in the Recommended Actions record page of UI Builder in Service Operations Workspace.

To configure the Context ID, see **Configuring a context record for Recommended Actions component** section in [Create a context in Recommended Actions](../../customer-service-management/ra-csm-contexts-create.md).

## Rules in Recommended Actions for ITSM

A rule is a set of conditions that applies to a context. A rule shows recommendations to agents with certain roles for records that meet certain conditions. For more information, see [Rules in Recommended Actions](../../customer-service-management/ra-csm-rules.md).

The ITSM base system includes the following rules:

-   Active incident
-   Active non-child non-MI Incident
-   AI Search
-   Major Incident with no Problem record

**Note:** These rules are available only for the Incident context.

For more information about the field descriptions of these rules, see [Rules in Recommended Actions for ITSM](rules-in-recommended-actions-for-itsm.md).

**Note:** To create a rule, see [Create a rule in Recommended Actions](../../customer-service-management/ra-csm-rules-create.md).

## Recommendations in Recommended Actions for ITSM

A recommendation is a way to suggest a helpful action to an agent. A recommendation includes the action and any relevant resources and inputs. For more information, see [Recommendations in Recommended Actions](../../customer-service-management/ra-csm-recommendations.md).

For more information about recommendation types, see [Recommendations in Recommended Actions](../../customer-service-management/ra-csm-recommendations.md).

**Note:** To create a recommendation, see [Create a recommendation in Recommended Actions](../../customer-service-management/ra-csm-recommendations-create.md).

The ITSM base system includes Guidance-based recommendations and Field-level recommendation types.

## Guidance-based recommendations

The ITSM base system includes these guidance-based recommendations:

-   AI Search Recommendation
-   Create Problem Record for a Major Incident
-   Open incidents \(CI &amp; Service\)
-   Open PRBs \(CI &amp; Service\)
-   Similar Incidents \(TI\)
-   Similar KB Articles \(Similarity\)

-   Predictive Intelligence -based recommendations:
    -   Assignment Group \(Classification\)
    -   Configuration Item \(Classification\)
    -   Service \(Classification\)
-   Task Intelligence for ITSM -based recommendation: Incident Fields value prediction \(TI\)

    **Note:** All Predictive Intelligence -based recommendations included in the ITSM base system are inactive by default. To activate them, navigate to the Recommendations screen, edit the corresponding Active column to the required recommendation of **true**, and select **Update**.


For more information about the field-level recommendations field descriptions, see [Field level recommendations in Recommended Actions for ITSM](field-level-recommendations-in-recommended-actions-for-itsm.md).

**Note:** To create a guidance and field recommendations, see [Creating guidance and field recommendation in Recommended Actions](../../customer-service-management/ra-csm-config-recommendations.md).
