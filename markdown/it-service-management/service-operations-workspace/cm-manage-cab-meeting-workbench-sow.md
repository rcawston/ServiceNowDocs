6.  Select **Start meeting** to start the meeting.

    Each attendee who connects to the meeting has independent access to the widgets on the meeting page on the CAB workbench while the meeting is in progress.

7.  Review the agenda items, and approve or reject them.

    1.  Select the agenda item to see its details.

        **Note:** The timer displays the time remaining for discussing the current meeting agenda item. The color code in the timer changes based on the overall percentage of time elapsed from the total duration of the meeting.

        -   Green: 0% - 50%
        -   Yellow: 50% - 70%
        -   Orange: 75% - 100%:
        -   Red: &lt; 100%:
    2.  Select the change request number either from the agenda item card or form header of its details to open the change request record.

    3.  Review the details of the change for any scheduling conflicts such as another change or a blackout or holiday schedule.

    4.  After reviewing and discussing, any assigned approver for the related change request can approve or reject.

        1.  Select **Make approval decision**.

            **Note:** The button is available only to change approvers.

        2.  In the Approval decision dialog box, select **Approve** to approve or **Reject** to reject the agenda item.
        3.  Add comments about the decision in **Approval notes**.
        4.  Select **Submit**.
        CAB manager or approvers' decisions on agenda items—whether approved, rejected, or skipped without any decision—are automatically noted in the meeting notes. These decisions are also saved in the **Meeting notes** field of the related CAB meeting record. The timer for the agenda item stops and the agenda item is moved to the **All** tab.

    5.  Select **Pause** to pause the timer of the current agenda item.

    6.  Select **Resume** to resume the timer of the current agenda item.

    7.  Select **Next item** if you want to skip an agenda item.

        **Note:** The current agenda item is moved as the last card in the **Up next** tab. The next agenda item in the list displays.

    8.  In the **Up next** tab, select the second or any subsequent agenda item to move it to the top of the list by selecting **Make next agenda item**.

    9.  In the **Deferred** tab, view the deferred agenda items and select an agenda item and select **Restore** to restore them for discussion.

        The agenda item moves to the **Up next** tab.

    10. In the **All** tab, view agenda items by using the filters: All agenda Items, My agenda items, and Completed.

8.  In the contextual menu, view the meeting details, attendees list, and take meeting notes.

    -   Select the meeting information icon \(![Meeting information icon.](../image/cm-icon-meeting-info.png)\) to view the meeting details.
    -   Select the attendees icon \(![Attendees icon.](../image/cm-icon-attendee.png)\) to view the list of attendees along with their response to the meeting invitation.

        The green circle mark next to the name of attendees indicates they are currently connected to the meeting.

    -   Select the notes icon \(![Notes icon.](../image/cm-icon-meeting-notes.png)\) to enter meeting notes and save into the CAB meeting record or email it to the attendees.

        **Note:** Only the CAB manager or delegates can enter the notes for the overall meeting. Other attendees in the meeting can review the notes in the read-only mode.

9.  After all agenda items have been reviewed, select **End Meeting** to end the CAB meeting.
