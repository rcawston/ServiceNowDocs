# Custom Modal Migration in Standard Record Page

Modify the modal containers inside a record page in the Service Operations Workspace.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

Standard Record Page \(SRP\) provides options to modify the different modals used inside Service Operations Workspace. You can duplicate the modals in the page collection and modify them according to your requirement.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now Experience Framework** &gt; **UI Builder**.

2.  Under the Experiences list, select **Service Operations Workspace**.

3.  Under the **Pages and Variants** section, under **Record**, select **SRP Record**.

    **Note:** If you are on a version prior to 4.0, you can navigate from **Record SNC** in **UI Builder** to modify the **Overview** tab of an Incident record page.

4.  From the left of the UI Builder, navigate to **Modals and popovers** &gt; **Modals**, and select **Modal Container \(Viewport\)**.

5.  From the right of the UI Builder, navigate to **Configs** &gt; **Page collection**.

    There are two options available under Page collections.

    -   Record Page Modals: Select this option to modify modals across all experiences.
    -   SOW Record Page Modals: Select this option to modify the modals used in Service Operations Workspace.
6.  Select the ![Variants in SOW Record page modals.](../image/open-side-panel-tab.png) icon to open the variants provided.

7.  Select the ![Create new page](../image/add-icon.png) icon to create a page or to add a new variant to a page.
