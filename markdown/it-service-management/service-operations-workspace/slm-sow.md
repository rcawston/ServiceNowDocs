You should configure SLA timer configuration mappings for these timer configurations. For information on how you can configure these mappings, see [Configure the SLA timer](../service-level-management/sla-timer-configurations.md).

### Procedure

1.  Open an incident record page.

2.  From the contextual side panel, select the record Information icon \(![record Information icon](../image/record-info-icon.png)\).

    -   The response and resolution SLAs are displayed.
    -   In case of multiple SLA timer configuration mappings for Incident Response and Incident Resolution timer configurations, only one response and resolution SLA record associated with the mapping with the least order is displayed.
    -   After the SLA is complete, the time taken to respond and resolve the incident are displayed.
    For information about configuring the display of SLA information, see [Customize the display of service level agreements for an incident](customize-the-incident-record-page.md#).
