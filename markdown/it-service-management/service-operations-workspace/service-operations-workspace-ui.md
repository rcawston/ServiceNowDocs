# Service Operations Workspace for ITSM user interface

You can navigate through the Service Operations Workspace to get an overview of how an agent can prioritize tasks and provide resolution.

## Landing page

In Service Operations Workspace, you can access the landing page by selecting the home icon \(![Home icon](../image/sow-home.png)\) from the left navigation pane.

An agent can analyze assignments and view announcements and upcoming tasks. Tier 1 agents can also analyze the performance and view the assigned courses. For information about the landing page, see [Service Operations Workspace for ITSM landing page](sow-ui-landing-page.md).

## Lists

In Service Operations Workspace, you can access the lists by selecting the list icon \(![List icon](../../itsm-manager-workspace/image/lists_icon.png)\) from the left navigation pane.

An agent can analyze the individual lists of incidents, catalog tasks, requests, problem, and so on, and take appropriate action.

From the **My Lists** tab, an agent can create a separate list or a different version of the existing list. For information about creating a list, see [Create a list in Service Operations Workspace](create-list-sow.md).

## Inbox

In Service Operations Workspace, you can the open inbox from the left navigation pane.

An agent can set their status to Available or Away to open or close the inbox for chat requests. When a requester initiates a chat conversation from any Service Portal page, the chat interaction appears in the inbox of all agents who are configured as group members for Agent Chat Queue. For information about inbox configuration, see [Configure the inbox in Service Operations Workspace](configure-inbox-in-sow.md).

The following scenarios are possible for assignment of chat conversation to an agent.

-   When the automatic assignment of chat conversations is enabled, the chat conversation is automatically assigned to the agent, an interaction record is created in Service Operations Workspace, and the agent can continue the chat conversation. Based on options selected in the Chat - Most Capacity assignment rule, the interactions can open as non-active tabs in the inbox. For information on enabling automatic assignment of chat conversations using this assignment rule, see [Enable automatic assignment of interactions to an agent](enable-automatic-assignment-interaction.md).
-   When the automatic assignment of chat conversations is not enabled, the agent can then approve or reject the chat conversation. When the agent accepts the chat conversation, an interaction record is created in Service Operations Workspace and the agent can continue the chat conversation.

When the requester in Service Portal or the agent in Service Operations Workspace ends the chat conversation, the interaction is closed.
