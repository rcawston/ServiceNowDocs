# Perform post-migration tasks for related list declarative form actions

Verify that the related list declarative form actions in Service Operations Workspace \(SOW\) are consistent with the related list declarative form actions in ITSM Agent Workspace \(ITSM AW\) and they’re ready for use in SOW. You can update the migrated related list declarative form actions settings in SOW based on your requirements.

## Before you begin

When performing the migration, you must have selected the **Relative list declarative form actions** option for ITSM Agent Workspace features. For example, the **Relative list declarative form actions** option for Incident Management. For information about the migration process, see [Migrate from ITSM Agent Workspace to Service Operations Workspace for ITSM](migrate-itsm-agent-workspace-to-sow.md).

Role required: admin

## About this task

## Procedure

1.  If the migration is successful, perform the following steps to verify the related list actions are visible on the forms.

    1.  Open SOW for ITSM and ITSM Agent Workspace instances.

        -   To open SOW, navigate to **All** &gt; **Workspace Experience** &gt; **Workspaces** &gt; **Service Operations Workspace**.
        -   To open ITSM Agent Workspace, enter `<instance-name>.service-now/workspace` in the web browser.
    2.  Open the forms in ITSM Agent Workspace and SOW.

        The migrated related list actions are shown on the forms.

        Duplicate related list actions might be displayed on the form when you don't migrate the view rule. So, SOW field declarative actions still show up even after migration if the view isn't changed.

        If the migration is successfully completed and not visible in the UI or not working properly the cross-check the conditions in Advance view.

2.  1.  On the migration completion page in SOW Admin Center, select **View migration details**.

2.  Select the **Go to system logs** \(![System logs icon](../../service-builder/image/sb-service-triangle.png)\) icon.

3.  Review the logs to determine which items failed during migration.

4.  Based on each failed item, identify which step has failed and perform the steps mentioned in the following topics.
