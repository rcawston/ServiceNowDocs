# Configure asset utilization metrics

Configure the display of the asset utilization metrics for Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager for Investigation.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cimaf.sn\_cimaf\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Open the Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager.

2.  Select the required CI device, and verify the CMPivot entities and attributes.

    For more information, see [Verify a CMPivot entity](verify-cmpivot-entity.md).

3.  Configure the Disk Utilization metrics by verifying that the **Disk** CMPivot entity exists and has the attributes **Size** and **Free Space**.

4.  Configure the Memory Utilization metrics.

    1.  Verify that the **Memory** CMPivot entity exists and has the attribute **TotalPhysicalMemory**.

    2.  Verify that the **OS** CMPivot entity exists and has the attribute **FreePhysicalMemory**.

5.  Configure the CPU Utilization metrics by verifying that the **Processor** CMPivot entity exists and has the attribute **LoadPercentage**.

    If the **Processor** CMPivot entity doesn’t exist, you must add the entity to the hardware inventory. For more information, see [Extend hardware inventory](extend-hardware-entity.md).

6.  Configure the Uptime metrics by verifying that the **OperatingSystem** CMPivot entity exists and has the attribute **LastBootUpTime**.


## Result
