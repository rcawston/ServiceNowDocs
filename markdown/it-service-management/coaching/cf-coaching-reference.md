# Coaching reference

Coaching reference content includes business rules and field descriptions.

## Coaching on a non-task table

To provide coaching on a table source that does not extend the Task table, you must create a business rule to initiate the coaching process.

The business rule **Evaluate coaching opportunity on tasks** initiates coaching for tables that extend Task. You can copy this business rule and modify it for tables that do not extend the Task table.
