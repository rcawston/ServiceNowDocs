# SLA transitions

SLA records pass through a series of transitions during processing.

The following transitions exist for an SLA:

-   Attach: when an SLA is created and bound to a task.
-   Pause: when an SLA should temporarily stop tracking time.
-   Resume: when an SLA should resume tracking elapsed time.
-   Complete: when an SLA is marked complete.
-   Reattach: when an SLA is marked completed and a new copy is reapplied.
-   Cancel: when an SLA is cancelled.

SLA conditions determine what action is performed on a task SLA record.

|If Start condition matches, and **When to Cancel** is set to **Start conditions are not met**|Cancel if one or more of the specified start conditions no longer match.|
|If Start condition matches, and **When to Cancel** is set to **Cancel conditions are met**|Cancel when cancel conditions match.|
