# Invoke an SLA condition rule globally

You can globally change the default set of SLA condition rules.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

By default, the SLAConditionBase is used for the SLA condition rules. This can be changed by doing the following:

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Level Management** &gt; **SLA Properties**.

2.  Change the value of the **com.snc.sla.default\_conditionclass** [SLA property](t_ConfigureSLAProperties.md#) to the new condition rule name:

    ![SLAConditions Property](../image/SLAConditionsProperty.png)

    **Note:** This is the default condition rule, if no condition rule is specified on an SLA definition.
