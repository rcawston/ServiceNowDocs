# Create an incident

Create an incident record to document a deviation from an expected standard of operation.

## Before you begin

Role required: itil, sn\_incident\_write, or admin

## About this task

This procedure describes how an ITIL agent completes the Incident form. Incidents are also logged when a user fills out a record producer in the service catalog, or sends an email to the instance.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Incident** &gt; **Create New**.

    You can also click **New** from the Incident list view.

    **Note:** If the UI16 module link redirection feature is enabled in Service Operations Workspace \(SOW\) and the UI16 module supports the redirect configuration, navigating through UI16 paths automatically redirects you to the equivalent list or record pages in SOW instead of displaying the UI16 forms or lists. For more information, see [Redirect UI16 module links to Service Operations Workspace](../service-operations-workspace/redirect-ui16-module-links-sow.md).

2.  [Use a template](t_UseATemplateFromAForm.md), if one exists for the type of incident that you are logging.

    If the organization uses form templates, then you can apply a template to pre-populate some of the fields for specific types of incidents.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    Your organization has configured the Incident form to adhere to its incident management process. Enter information in the form field is based on the process. The following table describes typical Incident form fields.

<table id="table_wjm_hsv_vy"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Number

</td><td>

Unique system-generated incident number.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Caller

</td><td>

User who contacted you with an issue.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Category and Subcategory

</td><td>

Type of issue. After selecting the category, select the subcategory, if applicable.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Service

</td><td>

Affected business service, if applicable. **Note:**

If you select a business service as the configuration item and if that business service is also listed as the configuration item in any other active task, then the active tasks icon \(![Other active tasks](../../change-management/image/other-active-task.png)\) appears. Click the icon to view the list of all the other active tasks that are affecting the business service.

You can view the BSM map \(dependency view\) of the selected business service by clicking the dependency icon \(![Open dependency view](../image/dependency-icon-r.png)\).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Service Offering

</td><td>

Service offering consists of one or more service commitments that uniquely define the level of service in terms of availability, scope, pricing, and packaging options. This field enables you to receive different features and their levels of performance for a given service.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Configuration item

</td><td>

Affected CI, if applicable.After a CI is selected, you can click the open **Dependency views** icon \(![Open dependency view](../image/dependency-icon-r.png)\) next to the field to see how the CI maps into the infrastructure. The dependency view shows you what is impacted and whether other CIs or services are experiencing issues. To capture information on the affected CIs, refer to [Capture information on affected configuration items in an incident](track-ci.md).

When adding configuration items to the **Configuration item** field of an incident form, the search result containing a list of configuration items \(CI\) is displayed and sorted based on the CI names in alphabetical order.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Channel

</td><td>

Communication method that is used by the user to create the incident. Following are the available options:-   Chat
-   Email
-   Phone
-   Monitoring
-   Self-service
-   Virtual agent
-   Walk-in


</td></tr><tr><td>

Origin

</td><td>

Source of the incident. For example, if an incident is created from alert, this field contains the value Alert. This is a auto-populated field and you cannot fill the value manually.

</td></tr><tr><td>

State

</td><td>

State of the incident. The state moves and tracks incidents through several stages of resolution.**Tip:** Use the **State** field, rather than the **Incident State** or **Problem State** fields, as your primary means of tracking the state of an incident because this state progresses through the entire processing cycle. To learn more, see [Life cycle of an Incident](c_IncidentManagementStateModel.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Impact

</td><td>

Impact is a measure of the effect of an incident, problem, or change on business processes.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Urgency

</td><td>

Urgency is a measure of how long the resolution can be delayed until an incident, problem, or change has a significant business impact.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Priority

</td><td>

Priority is based on impact and urgency, and it identifies how quickly the service desk should address the task.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Assignment group

</td><td>

Group who will work on the incident. The business rule **Populate Assignment Group based on CI/SO** populates the **Assignment group** field based on the support group available for the configuration item \(CI\) or the Service offering consecutively.

**Note:** The business rule is triggered when an incident is created or updated, and when the **Assignment group** and the **Assigned to** fields are empty.

 If you want to override the default value, then you need to create new properties and provide the field in the property value that must be used to populate the **Assignment group** field. Create the properties in the following order of preference:

-   **com.snc.incident.ci\_assignment\_group.field\_name**: Identifies which CI field populates the **Assignment group** field.
-   **com.snc.incident.service\_offering\_assignment\_group.field\_name**: Identifies which service offering field populates the **Assignment group** field.
 **Note:**

-   The sys\_user\_group **read** ACL calls the SNCRoleUtil function. The function verifies whether the group that is reviewed contains either the admin role or security\_admin role. The function enables the user to view the group only if the user has the same role. As a result, a user with the itil role cannot assign an incident to a group that has the admin role or security\_admin role, nor to any group whose parent has those roles.
-   Other than using the read ACLs, you can also restrict incidents with specific assignment group\(s\) for visibility only to the group members using before-query business rule. For details, see [How to restrict a specific group incidents to only its group members \[KB0790987\]](https://support.servicenow.com/nav_to.do?uri=%2Fkb%3Fid%3Dkb_article_view%26sysparm_article%3DKB0790987) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.
