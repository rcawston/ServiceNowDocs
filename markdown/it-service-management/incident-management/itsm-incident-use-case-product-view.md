# Applying CSDM guidelines to Incident Management

Incident Management supports the incident management process with the ability to identify and log incidents, classify and prioritize incidents, assign incidents to appropriate users or groups, escalate, resolve, and report incidents. The goal of this product view is to help you to understand how Incident Management key entities work with the core CSDM framework.

Features of Incident Management that get the most benefit from the CSDM include:

-   Agent Workspace gives agents the information they need to quickly prioritize and resolve incidents.
-   The major incident workbench includes a single-pane view you can use to identify, track, and resolve high-impact incidents.
-   The native mobile app allows agents to quickly view and respond to tasks on-the-go, and can approve the requests with a single swipe.
-   Incident deflection encourage self-help by suggesting related knowledge base articles.
-   Improves collaboration on incident tasks by using drag-and-drop functionality on visual task boards.
-   Performance analytics provide detailed insights into performance trends.

Incident Management includes a form you can use to report incidents.

The incident form references the following attributes and related lists.

1.  Service — References the \[cmdb\_ci\_service\] table.
2.  Service Offering \(attribute\) — References the \[service\_offering\] table. Displays the service offerings affected by the incident in the Service Offerings related list.
3.  Configuration Items — References the \[cmdb\_ci\] table
4.  Affected/Causal CIs — Related list \[task\_ci\] table. \(The Incident form allows Application Services to be chosen as CIs\)
5.  Impacted Services — Related list \[task\_cmdb\_ci\_service\] table
6.  Service Offering — Related list \[task\_service\_offering\] table
