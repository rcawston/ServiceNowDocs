# Exploring Software Asset Management Foundation plugin

Starting with the Australia release, we have enhanced the Software Asset Management Foundation plugin application's user interface to make it more user-friendly and intuitive, allowing you to better manage your software installations.

You can use the new Software Asset Management Foundation plugin user interface, referred to as Software Asset Workspace or continue using the classic Software Asset Management Foundation plugin framework.

The Software Asset Management Foundation plugin application's core functionality remains the same in both the user interfaces.

## Using the Software Asset Workspace

Once you request and activate the Software Asset Management Foundation plugin \(com.snc.sams\), you need to activate the Software Asset Workspace \(sn\_sam\_workspace\) store application too.

**Note:** Once you activate the workspace plugin, you cannot revert to the classic Software Asset Management Foundation plugin application.

For detailed information on configuring and using the Software Asset Workspace, refer to [Configuring Software Asset Management Foundation plugin workspace](configuring-samf-plugin-workspace.md) and [Using Software Asset Management Foundation plugin workspace](using-samf-workspace.md).

## Using the classic Software Asset Management Foundation plugin application

To continue using the classic Software Asset Management Foundation plugin application, just activate the Software Asset Management Foundation plugin \(com.snc.sams\) plugin.

If you later decide to use the Software Asset Workspace, you need to activate the Software Asset Workspace \(sn\_sam\_workspace\) store application.

For detailed information on configuring and using the classic Software Asset Management Foundation plugin application, refer to [Configuring the classic Software Asset Management Foundation plugin](samf-plugin-configuration.md) and [Using Software Asset Management classic](../../it-asset-management/software-asset-management/using-sam-classic.md).
