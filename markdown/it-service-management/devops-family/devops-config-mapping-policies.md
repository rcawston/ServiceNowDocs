# Mapping policies in DevOps Config

Mapping a policy to a deployable enables you to validate updates on it. These policies in DevOps Config are powered by Policy as Code Engine \(PaCE\).

**Important:** DevOps Config is now deprecated and no longer supported or available for new activation.

After you create a policy, you can map it to a deployable to invoke the policy when any changes are made to the deployable. You can map policies using the following mappings:

-   **Static mapping**

    In static mapping, a policy is directly mapped to deployables. This mapping type helps you to apply policies to different environments or configurations. However, if you have to map a policy to multiple deployables, you would have to do it multiple times for each deployable. Validation is triggered on directly mapped policies for a deployable.

-   **Dynamic mapping**

    In dynamic mapping, a policy is mapped to deployables dynamically based on pre-defined conditions. This mapping type helps you to apply policies to a larger set of deployables across multiple applications that all meet the same conditions. Validation is triggered on dynamically mapped policies at run time for a deployable.


You can view all policies mapped to deployables of an application by selecting the **View mapped policies** option on the **Policies** tab on the Application form. Select a deployable from the list to view policies mapped to it using both static mapping or dynamic mapping.
