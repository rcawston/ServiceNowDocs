# Integrating your pipeline in DevOps Config

Integrate your Argo CD, Azure DevOps, or Jenkins pipeline with DevOps Config to interact with your data model.

**Important:** DevOps Config is now deprecated and no longer supported or available for new activation.

Validate application and infrastructure details against your organization policies, and commit config data the same way software code is committed to a code repository.

Configuration data is pulled in your CI/CD pipeline to deploy not just a code for an application, but all the related configuration with that code as well.

**Note:** Pipeline integration requires plugin installation. See [Configure your pipeline in DevOps Config](devops-config-set-up-pipeline.md) for installation requirements.

## DevOps Config and DevOps Change Acceleration

With the DevOps Change Velocity change control feature, a change request is created as part of the pipeline for DevOps Config configuration changes.

Set up change acceleration in your pipeline.

-   **Argo CD**
-   **Azure DevOps**

    Using the `ServiceNow-DevOps-Server-Change-Acceleration` Azure DevOps task.

-   **Jenkins**

    Using the `snDevOpsChange` Jenkins action.


In DevOps Change Velocity, navigate to **DevOps** &gt; **Orchestrate** &gt; **Pipeline Change Requests** to view and approve DevOps change requests created by DevOps Config changes.

See [Accelerating your DevOps change process](../devops-change-velocity/dev-ops-change-acceleration.md) for more information regarding the DevOps Change Acceleration feature.
