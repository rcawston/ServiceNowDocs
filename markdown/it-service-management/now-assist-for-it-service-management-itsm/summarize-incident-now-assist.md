Role required: itil

## About this task

The Incident summarization skill is turned on by default. The skill will be automatically available to appropriate role users for the application.When new customers install a Now Assist product, designated skills are turned on automatically. For existing users who upgrade, there will be no change to the skill activation. For more information, see [Now Assist skills, agents, and agentic workflows on by default](../../intelligent-experiences/now-assist-skills/now-assist-skills-on-by-default.md).

An incident summary provides you with a concise summary of an incident. The summary is based on the incident state and is generated from the information that you enter in the following fields:

-   Short description
-   Description
-   State
-   Priority
-   Work notes
-   Additional comments
-   Resolution notes \(for a resolved incident\)

For information about the incident states, see [Life cycle of an Incident](../incident-management/c_IncidentManagementStateModel.md).

You can summarize an incident in Core UI and Service Operations Workspace for ITSM.

## Procedure

1.  In Core UI or Service Operations Workspace for ITSM, open an incident that is assigned to you.

2.  Select **Summarize**.

    ![Summarize action in the Overview tab.](../image/itsm-incident-summarize.png)

    -   In Core UI, the summary appears in a banner of the incident record.

        ![Incident summary in Core UI that specifies the issue and actions taken.](../image/incident-summary-core-ui.png)

    -   In Service Operations Workspace for ITSM, the summary is generated in the **Overview** tab.

        **Note:**

        You can also generate the summary in the **Details** tab.

        If you'd like to hide the incident summarization in the Details tab so that you can restrict this option only to the Overview tab, see [Hide incident summarization on the incident Details tab](https://www.servicenow.com/community/developer-articles/hide-incident-summarization-on-the-incident-details-tab/ta-p/3480381) community article.

        You can provide feedback by selecting the thumbs up or thumbs down icon. You can also share the summary using the **Share** button.
