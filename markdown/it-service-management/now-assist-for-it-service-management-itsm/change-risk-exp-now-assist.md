# Explain the risk of a change request by using Now Assist for IT Service Management \(ITSM\)

Quickly generate the explanation of the calculated risk rating for a change request by using the change request risk explanation skill in the Now Assist for IT Service Management \(ITSM\) application.

## Before you begin

Role required: itil

## About this task

Data from these input fields in the change request input table is used to explain why a change risk is rated high, medium, or low:

-   Short description
-   Implementation plan
-   Assignment group
-   Risk
-   Description
-   Backout plan
-   Model type

Additional inputs include:

-   Similar change requests and the incidents caused by those changes
-   Risk condition that was met
-   Risk assessment

    By default, the assessment uses the top five normalized risk values sorted in descending order. If there’s a tie between the two values, the one with the lower order number is used. For information on risk assessment, see [Risk assessment](../change-management/c_RskAsmtCalc.md).


You can also add custom input fields.

You can generate the explanation of the calculated risk rating for a change request in Core UI and Service Operations Workspace for ITSM.

## Procedure

1.  In Core UI or Service Operations Workspace for ITSM, open a change request that is assigned to you.

2.  Select the Now Assist icon ![Now assist icon.](../../../common/image/icon-ai-sparkle.png) for the **Explain Risk** field.

    **Note:** The Now Assist icon ![Now assist icon.](../../../common/image/icon-ai-sparkle.png) isn’t available if the risk for the change request hasn’t already been calculated.

    The risk explained by Now Assist appears in a window on the change request record.

    ![The Change Risk explanation includes a list of relevant change requests to help you understand which risk factors contributed to the calculated risk](../image/now-assist-itsm-change-risk-citation.png)

3.  Elaborate or shorten the risk explained by Now Assist.

    -   To lengthen the generated response, select **Refine** &gt; **Elaborate**.
    -   To shorten the generated response, select **Refine** &gt; **Shorten**.
4.  When you're finished generating the explanation for a change request risk rating, you can provide feedback, copy it, or view information about it.
