The Change summarization skill is turned on by default. The skill will be automatically available to appropriate role users for the application.When new customers install a Now Assist product, designated skills are turned on automatically.

-   Risk
-   Impact
-   Justification
-   Implementation plan
-   Risk and impact analysis
-   Test plan
-   Backout plan
-   Close code
-   Close notes
-   Service offering
-   State
-   Conflict status
-   Type

For information about the change request states, see [State progression for normal, standard, and emergency changes](../change-management/normal-standard-emergency-states.md).
