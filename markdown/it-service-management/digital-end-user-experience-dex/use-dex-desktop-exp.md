# Use DEX Desktop Assistant

Use DEX Desktop Assistant to get quick access to self-service and diagnostic tools, notifications about outages and announcements, and support resources.

The DEX Desktop Assistant provides a dedicated communication interface for employees, enabling access to self-service options, IT notifications, and support resources.

Desktop Assistant facilitates streamlined workflows by enabling employees to perform network diagnostics, access IT catalogs, use the ServiceNow® Employee Center, and interact with virtual agents for assistance. IT teams can use the tool to issue outage notifications or critical announcements, promoting timely communication and efficient support delivery.
