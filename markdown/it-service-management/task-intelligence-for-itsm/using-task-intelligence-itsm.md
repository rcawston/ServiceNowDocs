# Managing Task Intelligence for ITSM models

Use the machine learning capabilities of Task Intelligence for ITSM to predict field level recommendations and similar records on the incidents which appear as actionable recommendations in the side panel.

Managing Task Intelligence for ITSM involves the following tasks.

## Creating a prediction model

You can create and deploy solution-based prediction models to predict incidents fields and actionable real-time recommendations based on the similarities between two types of tables by comparing their fields for IT service incidents.

Task Intelligence for ITSM provides the following types of prediction models:

-   Incident Categorization: This model predicts incidents fields for new IT service incidents.
-   Similar Incidents: The model looks at the prediction fields of a prediction table and the training fields of a training table. It uses the similarities in these fields to predict similar records for incidents.
-   Major Incident Recommendation: The model recommends similar active major incidents which the current incident can be linked to, and recommends you propose similar incidents as a major incident.
-   Similar open Change Requests for Incident: The model looks at the incident fields of an incident table and the change request fields of a change request table. It uses the similarities in these fields to predict similar change requests for incidents.
-   Similar open Problems for Incident: The model looks at the incident fields of an incident table and the problem fields of a problem table. It uses the similarities in these fields to predict similar problems for incidents.

Creating a model involves the following steps:

-   Set up a model: Set up a prediction model using a template available in the base system.
-   Define a model: Specify the purpose of the model by selecting the training table and prediction table which will be used for training the model further.
-   Train a model: Train a model to make predictions using your data.
-   Assess your model: Assess the results from the model training, view sample results for the predictions, and select the prediction preferences and behavior for your model.
-   Deploy your model: Deploy your model to predict incident fields on incident forms.

## Editing a prediction model

Edit a prediction model that has already been trained and deployed. Change the model configurations, view the updated training results, and redeploy the model.

## Exporting a prediction model

Export a prediction model in Task Intelligence for ITSM to another instance so you can use the model in the other instance without recreating the model from scratch.
