# Assess the similarity model

Assess the results from the model training and view sample results to see the similar records predicted for incidents. Reviewing the results gives you a preview of how your model will perform after being deployed. Based on the sample results, select the prediction preference.

## Before you begin

You must train your model with various data. For more information on how to train your model, see [Train the similarity model](train-the-similarity-model.md)

Role required: sn\_ti\_admin.tia\_admin or admin 

## About this task

The model has flexible options. Based on the sensitivity and requirements of each incident record, you can do the following actions:

-   Recommend the similar records for the incidents.
-   Monitor and run the prediction model for the incidents in the background only.
-   Turn off the predictions for the incidents.

## Procedure

1.  View the number value in the **Estimated number of records used for training** section. 

    The number helps you predict how your model performs when deployed.

2.  Select **View sample results** to see the similar records predicted for each incident. 

3.  Choose one of the following options from the **Prediction preference** drop-down list for each field.

hows the top recommendations based on the similarity patterns. Agents can choose to accept or reject the recommendation. You can configure the number of recommended values using Advanced Recommended actions for ITSM. For more information, see [Recommended Actions for ITSM in Service Operations Workspace](../service-operations-workspace/recommended-actions-for-itsm-in-service-operations-workspace.md).

**Monitor only**

</td><td>

Monitors and runs the model in the background only without making any predictions on the incident form.
