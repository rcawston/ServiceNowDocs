# IT Issues pre-built topics for ITSM Virtual Agent

IT Issues topic conversations are designed to automate common IT-related issues, such as email setup, VPN connectivity, and conference room problems.

## Collaboration Applications

Users can use Virtual Agent to troubleshoot common issues with collaboration software, such as Cisco Webex, Zoom, and Microsoft Teams. This topic uses topic blocks that can be customized for your environment. If the user isn't satisfied with the static help content for the issue they're facing, they can perform an AI search or Contextual search. The type of search is dictated by the system property **sn\_itsm\_va.fallback\_search\_option**.​

This topic uses the following [topic blocks](itsm-va-topic-blocks.md):

-   Contextual Search
-   Create Incident
-   Troubleshoot Cisco Webex
-   Troubleshoot Microsoft Teams
-   Troubleshoot Zoom

## Local Admin Access

Users can request and gain admin rights and permission to install or access software and other admin-related items within your system.

Virtual Agent grants admin access and removes the access for all users on the device after the designated time period \(except users listed in DEFAULT\_ADMIN\_USERS\).

When the user requests help with admin access, Virtual Agent asks the user to select the device they would like admin privileges for.

Requirements:

-   [Agent Client Collector spoke](../../integrate-applications/integration-hub/acc-spoke.md) \(com.sn.acc.spoke\)
-   Applies to macOS users only

    If the user selects another operating system, Virtual Agent provides relevant KB articles.
