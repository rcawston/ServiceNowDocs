# Microsoft Active Directory pre-built topics for ITSM Virtual Agent

ITSM Virtual Agent helps you manage Microsoft Active Directory distribution lists using actions in conversation flows.

Natural Language Understanding \(NLU\) is used to identify and trigger the Microsoft Active Directory Group action that a user wants to perform.

Requirement: [Microsoft AD spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/microsoft-ad-spoke.md) for Integration Hub \(com.sn.ad.spoke\) plugin

**Note:** If the Microsoft Active Directory topics are duplicated in a different scope than ITSM Virtual Agent conversations, script logic can be affected and cause errors.

Group owners can add themselves or other users to a Microsoft Active Directory Group distribution list by providing the group name and the email address or username of one or more users to add.
