 Custom conditions have been defined and field values in these tables like source table, target table, and data source are auto-populated in each of these tables. You can use these flows by directly importing data into these tables and publish them when they’re ready. For details on importing data into these tables, see [Import data into the account onboarding playbook](account-lifecycle-import-data.md).

 These tables have been configured with specific conditions and field values have been auto-populated. You can modify these tables, add new tables, and activities depending on your requirements using the Process Automation Designer. See [Configure data validation using the Data Validation Assist table](account-lifecycle-data-valid-assist.md) for details.
