# Sample risk definitions

These are sample risk definitions available with the base system and can configured based on your requirements.

## Drop in NPS health

This is a metric based risk definition and generates a risk signal if the NPS score falls below a specified threshold. In this case, if the Daily collection of NPS metric score falls below 30, a risk signal is generated. Additionally, override conditions with different threshold values and ranking that can impact specific engagements are defined.

## SLA achievement in less than 90%

This is a metric based risk definition and generates a risk signal if the SLA achievement score falls below a specified threshold. In this case, if the Daily collection of % achieved incident SLA metric falls below 90, a risk signal is generated. An override condition with a different threshold value that can impact specific engagements has been defined. Additionally, a filter condition has been defined in the Applicable engagements field. This filter condition is applied along with the override condition when the risk signal is generated.

**Note:** For metric based definitions, the data source and the context engine mapping must be defined. See [Data Context Engine](account-lifecycle-setup-metric-data.md) for details.

## Missing renewal date in contract

This is a table based risk definition and generates a risk signal if the contract renewal date are missing. In this case, the Source table is the Contract table. This table must be mapped to the Engagement table. See [Configure the Context Engine Mapper](account-lifecycle-define-context-engine-mapper.md) for details. If the renewal start and end dates are missing in the Contract table, a risk signal is generated.
