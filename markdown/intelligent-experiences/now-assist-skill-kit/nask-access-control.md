# Configure security controls for a skill

You must define an access control list \(ACL\) and role restrictions for all skills. An ACL enables you to restrict who is able to access and execute a skill to only users with the correct role. Role restrictions enable users to limit roles during skill execution.

## About this task

If you have an existing skill that does not have an ACL, the execution of the skill is not disrupted. However, if you edit the skill and republish it, you must add an ACL.

If you try to execute a skill when you don’t have permission, you see an error that you aren’t authorized.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_skill\_builder.admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now Assist Skill Kit** &gt; **Home**.

    A modal appears to explain ACLs. You can select **Got it** or **View skills without ACLs**.

2.  Add an ACL and role restrictions to an existing skill.

    1.  Select the skill that you want to add an ACL to.

    2.  Select the **Deployment and skill settings** tab and then select **Security controls**.

    3.  Select **Add ACL**.

    4.  Select an option.
