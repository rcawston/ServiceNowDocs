# Configure skill deployment settings

Configure the deployment settings for the skill that you have created. The deployment settings enable you to choose where the admin can find the skill in Now Assist Admin.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_skill\_builder.admin

## About this task

Deployment settings control two things: where the skill appears in the Now Assist Admin console for an admin, and which activation methods are available to that admin. You must configure both before publishing the skill.

**Important:** Deployment settings for cloned ServiceNow skills cannot be edited. If you select **Deployment settings** on a cloned skill, a notification informs you that these settings are locked. To use custom deployment settings, create a skill from scratch instead of cloning.
