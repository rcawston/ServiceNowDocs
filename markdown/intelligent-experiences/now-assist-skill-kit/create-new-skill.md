# Create a skill

Create a custom skill for Now Assist. Creating a custom skill enables you to have greater flexibility with Now Assist's generative AI capabilities.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_skill\_builder.admin

**Note:** When you update Now Assist Skill Kit you should also update Generative AI Controller to ensure that your skills continue to perform correctly.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now Assist Skill Kit** &gt; **Home**.

2.  Select **Create new skill**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

Available providers:-   Now LLM Service
-   External LLM

You can use Now LLM Service, Now LLM Long Term Stable models \(LTS\), Azure OpenAI, Google Gemini or Anthropic Claude on AWS as the AI model provider for all Now Assist skills and AI agents. Use the Configuration Controls in [AI Control Tower](../ai-control-tower/ai-model-providers.md) to define which options are available, then set the skill-level preferences in the [Now Assist Admin console](../manage-large-language-models.md). For more information, see [Large language models on the ServiceNow AI Platform](../servicenow-large-language-model-now-llm/exploring-large-language-models.md).

    -   Spokes
    -   Custom LLM

For more information on setting up a custom large language model \(LLM\), see [Configure a generic large language model \(LLM\) connector](../generative-ai-controller/configure-a-generic-llm-connector.md)

Available prebuilt spokes that enable you to connect with an external LLM:

-   Microsoft Azure OpenAI Generative AI Spoke
-   OpenAI Generative AI Spoke
-   Aleph Alpha
-   WatsonX
-   Google Gemini \(MakerSuite and Vertex AI\)
**Note:** The spokes don't consume Integration Hub transactions. The spokes consume assists.
