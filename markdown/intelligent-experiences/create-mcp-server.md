# Create a Model Context Protocol server

Create a Model Context Protocol \(MCP\) server and configure which tools it exposes to MCP clients.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_mcp\_server.admin or admin

## About this task

Depending on your requirements, you can create one or more servers that expose different tools for different use cases, such as for HR or IT workflows, or for different clients. You can also use the preconfigured Quickstart Server.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **MCP Server Console**.

2.  From the Configuration tab, select **Servers**.

3.  Select **New**.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Label|An internal name for the server.|
    |Short description|A description of the capabilities and purpose of the server.|

5.  From the Tools section, add the tools that the server exposes.

    1.  Select **Add tools**.

    2.  Search for tools from the list and select the tools to expose.

        If you need to create a tool, select **Create tool**. For more information, see [Create a tool for a Model Context Protocol server](create-tool-mcp-server.md).

    3.  Select **Add**.

6.  Select **Create** to make the server active.

    **Note:** To save your changes but not make the server active yet, select **Save as draft** instead. To activate it later, you can select **Activate** from the server record or the Servers page.

    After creating the server, the Server URL field is populated with the endpoint that you use to integrate with clients: `https://<instance>.service-now.com/sncapps/mcp-server/mcp/<server-name>`.

    If you need to turn off access to an existing server, select **Deactivate** from the server record or the Servers page.


## What to do next

Configure clients to connect to the server. For more information, see [Connecting to an MCP server from an MCP client](connect-mcp-server-client.md#).
