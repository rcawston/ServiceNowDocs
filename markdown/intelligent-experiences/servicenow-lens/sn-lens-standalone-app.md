# Extract and analyze data with ServiceNow AI Lens desktop app

Extract and analyze data from one or more screenshots that you capture or files that you upload, and then preview the data analysis.

## Before you begin

To access the ServiceNow AI Lens functionality, perform the following steps:

-   Install ServiceNow AI Lens on your ServiceNow instance. For more information, see [Install the ServiceNow Lens in the ServiceNow instance](install-sn-lens.md).
-   Turn on the ServiceNow AI Lens skill to add the generative AI capability. For more information, see [Activate the ServiceNow AI Lens skill](activate-lens-skill.md).
-   Download the ServiceNow AI Lens installer to scan your desktop screen. For more information, see [Download the ServiceNow AI Lens installer](download-sn-lens-msi.md).

Don't scan any personally identifiable information, such as medical reports, financial reports, or other sensitive data, when using ServiceNow AI Lens as you don't want to expose the large language model \(LLM\) to any sensitive information.

Verify that you have provided permission to ServiceNow AI Lens to record the screen on your system.

Role required: lens\_user

## Procedure

1.  From your system, launch the ServiceNow AI Lens desktop application.

2.  On the login page, in the **Instance URL** field, enter the ServiceNow instance URL.

    For example, `https://<instance name>.service-now.com`.

3.  Select **Proceed**.

4.  Log in to your ServiceNow account by entering your username and password.

    Your account must have the lens\_user role.

    **Note:**

    -   If your administrator has enabled auto-login, you can skip signing in every time you launch ServiceNow AI Lens. After your first login, ServiceNow AI Lens automatically takes you to the home page on subsequent launches as long as your session is active. If your session expires or you sign out, ServiceNow AI Lens shows the login screen again. For more information, see [Set up auto-login for ServiceNow AI Lens](configure-instance-url-and-auto-login.md).
    -   On macOS, when you launch ServiceNow AI Lens desktop app for the first time, your Mac asks whether ServiceNow AI Lens can store your login credentials. Select **Always Allow** to avoid entering your credentials every time you open the application.
5.  On the onboarding journey widget, complete the onboarding and select **Got it**.
