-   **Use Lens actions to customize Lens behavior**

    You can use Lens actions that define Lens behavior depending on how ServiceNow AI Lens is triggered and what context is set. You can define default instructions, trigger options, custom context, transform response logic, and post processing instructions for the Lens execution. With Lens actions, you can customize how a classic form auto-filled using ServiceNow AI Lens or what data must be extracted for preview and post process the LLM response. For more information, see [Customize ServiceNow AI Lens behavior by creating a Lens action](servicenow-lens-actions.md#).

    For example, you can define a Lens action that is used when Lens is triggered from an instance to populate a form of a particular table. You can also define form fields that must be populated.

-   **Use as a back-end service**

    As part of your integration logic, configure a Lens action as one of the steps to invoke a ServiceNow AI Lens service from any part of the ServiceNow AI Platform, such as a workspace form or a portal.

    For your own use cases, you can leverage Lens actions for using Lens as a service in the following ways:

    -   Client service: Launch the Lens client to scan and analyze images. For example, you can configure a UI action on a workspace form or a service portal to launch the Lens client. For more information, see [KB2492775](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?sys_kb_id=d5a3f9a693b3aa18d9743f986cba1094&id=kb_article_view).
    -   Server service: Use Lens as a service to analyze the provided images without launching the Lens client. For example, you can call Lens service from a Script Include or flow action to get the LLM response after analyzing the visual data. For more information, see [Script include - AILensActionService](ai-lens-action-service-api.md#).
-   **Attach images to a record**

    View the captured images attached to the record that is auto-filled using ServiceNow AI Lens. You can later refer the attached images to understand the source of the record data. For more information, see [Customize ServiceNow AI Lens behavior by creating a Lens action](servicenow-lens-actions.md#).

-   **Use as a standalone application**

    Use ServiceNow AI Lens as a standalone application for previewing extracted data or getting insights. You must connect to a ServiceNow instance before you start using ServiceNow AI Lens. For more information, see [Extract and analyze data with ServiceNow AI Lens desktop app](sn-lens-standalone-app.md).
