# Update a record in an instance by using ServiceNow AI Lens

Update a record in the ServiceNow instance by auto-filling the form fields with data that ServiceNow AI Lens extracts from captured screens, documents, and files.

## Before you begin

To access the ServiceNow AI Lens functionality, perform the following steps:

-   Install ServiceNow AI Lens on your ServiceNow instance. For more information, see [Install the ServiceNow Lens in the ServiceNow instance](install-sn-lens.md).
-   Turn on the ServiceNow AI Lens skill to add the generative AI capability. For more information, see [Activate the ServiceNow AI Lens skill](activate-lens-skill.md).
-   Download the ServiceNow AI Lens installer to scan your desktop screen. For more information, see [Download the ServiceNow AI Lens installer](download-sn-lens-msi.md).

**Note:**

-   To use ServiceNow AI Lens from your browser, turn on the ServiceNow AI Lens skill.
-   For the full range of ServiceNow AI Lens capabilities, turn on the ServiceNow AI Lens skill, and download and install the desktop application.

Verify that ServiceNow AI Lens has access to record the screen on your system. For more information, see [Providing permission to ServiceNow AI Lens](download-sn-lens-msi.md#lens-permission).

Don't scan any personally identifiable information, such as medical reports, financial reports, or other sensitive data, when using ServiceNow AI Lens as you don't want to expose the large language model \(LLM\) to any sensitive information.

## About this task

You can update a record in the ServiceNow instance in two ways:

-   **From your browser**: Capture the contents from the browser, and let ServiceNow AI Lens analyze the captured screen and auto-fill the form fields — no download or installation required. For more information, see [Update record in ServiceNow instance from the browser](update-record-sn-lens.md#use-your-browser1).

    **Note:**

    -   The capture experience may vary depending on your browser.

        **Tip:** For the best experience, use ServiceNow AI Lens on any Chromium-based browser.

    -   The browser-based experience supports single-screen capture. To capture multiple screens or upload files, [Use ServiceNow AI Lens from the desktop application](create-record-sn-lens.md#use-desktop-app).
-   **From the desktop app**: Use the ServiceNow AI Lens desktop app for the full range of capture and analysis capabilities, such as multi-image capture and file uploads. For more information, see [Update a record on ServiceNow instance by using the desktop app](update-record-sn-lens.md#use-desktop-app1).

## Procedure

1.  Update a record in the ServiceNow instance by performing any of the following methods.

<table id="choicetable_cyz_stv_v3c"><thead><tr><th align="left" id="d62727e241">

Method

**From your browser**

</td><td>

1.  In your instance, navigate to the list view of any table, for example, Incidents.
2.  Open the record that you want to update.
3.  Select **Update with Lens**.

**Note:**

    -   If pop-up is blocked, ServiceNow AI Lens screen may not open. Confirm that you've already allowed pop-ups from your browser settings.
    -   On non-production instances, you can control on which tables the **Update with Lens** button appears using the following system properties:
        -   `sn_app_lens_core.show_lens_action_on_all_tables`: Set to true to show the **Update with Lens** button on all tables. Set to false to show it only on specific tables. Default is true.
        -   `sn_app_lens_core.lens_inclusion_table_list`: Enter the names of the tables as comma-separated values where you want the **Update with Lens** button to appear. Use this property only when the `sn_app_lens_core.show_lens_action_on_all_tables` property is set to false.
        -   `sn_app_lens_core.lens_exclusion_table_list:` Enter the names of the tables as comma-separated values where you want to hide the Create with Lens button, regardless of how the `sn_app_lens_core.lens_inclusion_table_list` property is set.
4.  Select **Capture screen**.

7.  Select **Confirm**.
8.  \(Optional steps\). Perform the following steps:
    -   In the Additional instructions field, enter specific instructions to guide ServiceNow AI Lens in extracting the information you need from the captured screen.
    -   Select **Re-capture** to discard the current capture and capture a new screen.
    -   Select **Revert to original** to undo the crop and restore the full captured image.
    -   Select **Crop** to further refine your selection by cropping the already cropped screen.
9.  To let ServiceNow AI Lens analyze the captured screen, select **Analyze**.
