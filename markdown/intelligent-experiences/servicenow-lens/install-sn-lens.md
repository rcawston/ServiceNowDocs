# Configure ServiceNow AI Lens

If you have the admin role, you can enable the ServiceNow AI Lens application \(sn\_ai\_lens\) to extract and comprehend data for various workflows.

## Before you begin

To get started with ServiceNow AI Lens, you must have:

-   A ServiceNow Pro Plus or Enterprise Plus license.
-   An instance on Yokohama Patch 6+ or Zurich Patch 1+.

Role required: admin

## About this task

ServiceNow AI Lens isn’t a standalone application that you can install directly. To enable ServiceNow AI Lens on your instance, you must install other Now Assist applications, such as Now Assist for IT Service Management \(ITSM\) or Now Assist for Customer Service Management \(CSM\).

-   Review the [ServiceNow AI Lens](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/2527a8af90db9e10f877653916085448/1.0.0) application listing in ServiceNow Store for information on dependencies, licensing or subscription requirements, and release compatibility.
-   Refer to the [Now Assist Overview](https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-assets/public/en-us/doc-type/legal/sn-assist-overview.pdf) to see the prebuilt skills that exist and are currently available for purchase in ServiceNow Now Assist packages and to review the number of assists consumed.
-   Perform these steps in your ServiceNow instance.

By enabling the ServiceNow AI Lens application \(sn\_ai\_lens\), you can view the ServiceNow AI Lens and download modules in your ServiceNow instance.

The following items are installed with ServiceNow AI Lens:

-   Roles
-   Tables

    For example, you can enter Now Assist for IT Service Management \(ITSM\).

3.  Press **Enter**.

    The Now Assist application listing appears.
