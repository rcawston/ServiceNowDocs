If you have an agent role, you can use the Now Assist in Document Intelligence workspace to analyze and extract information from your documents with generative AI.

In this workflow:

-   A workflow integration creates a document task as part of its flow.
-   A document is uploaded for processing in a document task.
-   Now Assist processes the document and makes predictions based on the fields defined in the use case.
-   If the use case is not set to full automation, the task is sent to a live agent for review.
-   The agent provides input to validate or correct the values predicted by Now Assist.
-   The task is completed and the integrated workflow proceeds as defined.
