</table>## Navigating from the Now Assist panel

Navigate from the Now Assist panel without leaving the current conversation by entering a navigation request in the **Ask Now Assist to...** field. If you enter "navigate me to active incidents," Now Assist displays a button that enables you to view the active incidents.

## Chat summarization

Quickly learn the details of a chat by reading a chat summarization. The chat summarization gives you enough details about the chat so that your requester doesn't have to repeat the same information to you.

To generate a chat summarization from the Now Assist panel, select **Chat Summarization** or enter `summarize chat` in the **Ask Now Assist to** field.

**Note:** You can also generate a chat summarization by using the `/summarize` quick action in Agent Chat.

## Case or incident summarization

Quickly learn the details of a case or incident by reading a case summarization. The summarization gives you enough details about the interaction so that your requester doesn't have to repeat the same information to you.

You can generate a case or incident summarization from the Now Assist panel for Now Assist for CSM, Now Assist for HRSD, or Now Assist for ITSM:

-   For Now Assist for CSM, select **Summarize record** or enter `summarize a record` in the **Ask Now Assist to** field.
-   For Now Assist for HRSD, select **Summarize record** or enter `summarize a record` in the **Ask Now Assist to** field.
-   For Now Assist for ITSM, select **Summarize incident** or enter `summarize an incident` in the **Ask Now Assist to** field.

## Conversation Help

Get specific and accurate answers to your queries by using the Get Help skill option on the Now Assist panel. This skill is available to everyone entitled to Now Assist capabilities.

For more information about the Now Assist Conversational Help skill which represents as Get Help on the Now Assist panel, see [Now Assist Conversational Help](now-assist-skills/conversational-help-skills.md).

## Resolution notes generation

Quickly learn the details of how an interaction was resolved by generating and reading resolution notes.

To generate resolution notes from the Now Assist panel, select **Generate resolutions notes** or enter `generate resolutions notes` in the **Ask Now Assist to** field.

## Streaming responses

After you enter a question or request on the Now Assist panel, Now Assist gathers information from Knowledge Base articles, external content, product documentation, catalog items, and workflows and combines them into a synthesized, comprehensive answer. Instead of waiting for the entire message to render, the synthesized response streams in real time and stops streaming after the entire message has been delivered. An animated sparkle icon \(![Now Assist sparkle icon](../../../common/image/icon-ai-sparkle.png)\) appears while the response is generated and changes to the static sparkle icon after the response has fully loaded.
