## Before you begin

To get started with AI Desktop Actions, you must have:

-   A ServiceNow Pro Plus or Enterprise Plus license.

-   Review the [AI Desktop Actions](https://store.servicenow.com/store/app/dc9057f4873932d0221e8409dabb35a5) application listing in ServiceNow Store for information on dependencies, licensing or subscription requirements, and release compatibility.
-   Perform these steps in your ServiceNow instance.
