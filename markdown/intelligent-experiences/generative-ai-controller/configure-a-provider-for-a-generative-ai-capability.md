# Set a provider for a generative AI capability

Determine which AI provider to use for each of the generative AI capabilities of Generative AI Controller.

## Before you begin

Configure your credentials for your preferred provider. See [Configuring API credentials for generative AI capabilities](configuring-api-credentials-for-generative-ai-capabilities.md) for more details.

Role required: admin

## About this task

Generative AI Controller comes with four capabilities by default. You can only configure a provider for the capabilities listed in the table in step 2. If you have installed other Now Assist applications, you may see other capabilities on the OneExtend Capability table. Those other capabilities use the Now LLM Service as their provider and can't be reconfigured.

## Procedure

1.  In the navigation filter, search for the OneExtend Capability table by entering `sys_one_extend_capability.list`.

2.  Open the record for the capability that you would like to configure, such as Sentiment Analysis.

</table>3.  In the OneExtend Definition Configs related list, set **Default** to `true` for your preferred capability provider.

    **Note:** By default, you can choose only one provider for a capability. For example, if **Default** is `true` for Sentiment \(OpenAI Completion\), you must set **Default** to `false` before changing **Default** to `true` for Sentiment \(Azure OpenAI\).
