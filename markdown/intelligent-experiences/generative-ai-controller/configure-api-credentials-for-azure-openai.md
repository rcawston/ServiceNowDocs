# Configure API credentials for Azure OpenAI

Configure your API credentials to use Azure OpenAI in custom workflows and Virtual Agent Designer topics.

## Before you begin

In order to use generative AI capabilities with Azure OpenAI, you must have an Azure resource with an API key.

Role required: admin

## About this task

In order to use models with Azure OpenAI as your LLM provider for Generative AI Controller capabilities, you must have an active connection configured.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Connections &amp; Credentials** &gt; **Connections &amp; Credential Aliases**.

2.  Open the Generative AI provider record for Azure OpenAI.

3.  Select the **Create New Connection &amp; Credential** related link.

4.  Edit the Connection URL to include your resource name.

    For Azure OpenAI, your Connection URL is in the form `https://{your-resource-name}.openai.azure.com`. See the [Azure OpenAI documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/reference#completions) for more information.

5.  In the API key field, enter the API key for the provider.

    **Note:** The characters in the API key field are masked in the user interface.

6.  Create a connection by selecting **Create**.


## Result

You can now use capabilities labeled with Azure OpenAI in Flow Designer, Virtual Agent Designer, and scripts like background scripts and business rules to create custom experiences with generative AI.
