# Select channels and access for an agentic workflow

In the guided setup for an agentic workflow, activate the agentic workflow to use in the Now Assist panel or UI actions in the Core UI and workspaces.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_aia.admin

## About this task

The final step of the agentic workflow guided setup includes options for where a user can invoke the agentic workflow. The Now Assist panel is available to users with the correct role. You can specify the exact conditions when a UI action is available to users on a table.

## Procedure

1.  Select whether you want users to use the Now Assist panel to invoke the agentic workflow.

2.  Add a UI action to your agentic workflow.

    1.  Select **Add UI action**.

    2.  Enter the UI action label.

        The UI action label is the text that the user sees in the button on the table.

    3.  Select a table where the UI action can be used.

        Users who are accessing a record on the selected table can view the UI action in the Core UI and workspaces. See [In-product agentic AI](in-product-agentic-ai.md) for more information about the AI Workflows panel.

    4.  Specify conditions for the UI action to appear and select **Add**.

        For example, you could only show a UI action for a Generate resolution plan agentic workflow if the record state is Active.

        **Note:** The display for a new UI action is turned on by default.

3.  Select **Save and test**.


## Result

You have completed the guided setup for creating an agentic workflow. Your new agentic workflow can be edited at any time using AI Agent Studio.

If you added a UI action for your agentic workflow in this guided setup, but the UI action is not appearing on forms, ensure that the property **com.glide.agentic\_processes\_view.enabled** is set to `true`.

## What to do next

Move to the **Testing** playground to [test an agentic workflow execution](test-aia-use-case.md) using example utterances or to [test user access](test-aw-access.md).
