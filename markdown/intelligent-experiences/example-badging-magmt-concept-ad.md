# Example: Automate badge request management using AI Desktop Actions

Automate various tasks related to badge requests through desktop actions using AI Desktop Actions and AI agents.

Your HR representatives manage repetitive badge-related tasks. For example, issuing new badges, distributing temporary badges, replacing lost badges, and disabling badges during offboarding. To streamline and automate this work, you can create a desktop action for each task and assign these actions to an AI Agent in AI Agent Studio.

When new requests come in, HR representatives can trigger the AI agent from the Now Assist panel. The AI Agent automatically selects and runs the appropriate desktop action. This automation reduces manual effort and enables them to focus on higher-value work.
