# Platform Approval assistance AI agent

The Approval assistance AI agent is an AI agent that enables you to see your list of pending approvals, as well as see the details about your pending approvals. You can then approve or reject requests and tickets from Now Assist in Virtual Agent.

## Approval assistance AI agent overview

Roles required: approver\_user, sn\_request\_approver\_read

**Note:** Add the necessary roles to enable reading of other tables whose records go through the approval process. For example, you can add the sn\_change\_read role to read Change Request records.

The benefit of using the Approval assistance AI agent is that you don't need to navigate to a specific page to approve your tickets. You can ask the AI agent about your pending approval requests and then tell the AI agent to approve or reject those approvals. The AI agent will ask follow-up questions and offer context-aware responses to simplify your experience.

Ask you administrator to configure the display fields and the knowledge base \(KB\) search fields to generate a Gen AI checklist to assist the Approval assistance AI agent in making targeted decisions. The checklist uses KB articles and policies to assist the Approval assistance AI agent in decision making. The checklist fetches information from knowledge base articles about specific requester approval tickets. An approval\_admin and admin role are required to configure the Approval assistance AI agent. For more information, see [Configure Service Portal Approval Configuration record](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/service-portal/configure-approval-assistance-ai-agent.md).

**Note:** Provide cross-scope privileges to the Now Assist Agents for Requester plugin for tables whose records are restricted within the scope of an application. For more information, see [Define cross-scope access to an application resource](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/set-RCA-level.md).

## Prerequisites and setup

To access this AI agent, you must have Now Assist Agent for Requester \(version 3 of the standard plugin\) installed on your instance, which is installed with Now Assist for Platform. You can get Now Assist for Platform when you install any other Now Assist application, such as Now Assist for IT Service Management \(ITSM\).

The Approval assistance AI agent displays data from the Approvals \[sysapproval\_approver\] table. If the user has been assigned to approve a request, the approval record is shown.

## Role masking

Required role:

AI agents use [role masking](aia-role-masking.md) to determine which users can access them. Ones installed with Now Assist applications have specific roles that come included with the application. If you select **Users with specific roles** for user access, you must configure the security controls to include these roles. For the instructions to change the security controls, see [Define security controls for an AI agent](define-sec-controls-aia.md).

In the data access settings, you must also add the necessary roles to enable reading of the tables for the records you want to evaluate for readiness. For example, you can add the itil role to the AI agent's list of approved roles so that it can access Incident records.

## Accessing the Approval assistance AI agent

To access the AI agent:

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Agent Studio** &gt; **Create and manage**.
2.  Go to the **AI Agents** tab.
3.  Select **Approval assistance AI agent**.

## Sample utterances

After the agent has been activated in AI Agent Studio, enter phrases such as the following or similar queries to run the AI Agent in Virtual Agent, the Now Assist panel, or Microsoft Teams.

-   Can you give me a list of pending approvals?
-   What are the pending approvals for time off requests?
-   Show me a list of pending approval requests by priority.
-   Give me details about my approval request?

## Performing approval action on an approval record

The Approval assistance AI agent shows approval requests that require an action on your part. After the approval information is provided by the agent, select **Approve** or **Reject** for a specific approval record, or type `Approve` or `Reject`. If you reject an approval request, then add a comment about the rejection reason.
