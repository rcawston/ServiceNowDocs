# Document field statuses

The following is a list of the statuses for fields in DocIntel document tasks. These statuses apply to fields for both document classification and data extraction.

**Important:** Starting with the Zurich release, Document Intelligence is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details, see the Deprecation Process article \[[KB0867184](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0867184)\] in the Now Support Knowledge Base. Instead, you can extract information from documents using the Now Assist in Document Intelligence application. For more information, see [Now Assist in Document Intelligence](../now-assist-in-document-intelligence/docintel-nowassist-landing.md).
