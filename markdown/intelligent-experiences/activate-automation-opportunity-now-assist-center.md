# Implement an automation opportunity from Now Assist Center

Deploy a matched AI agent or a new agent to automate a resolution for an identified automation opportunity.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_na\_center.nac\_admin

## About this task

Follow these steps to implement an automation opportunity with AI Agent Advisor.

Each automation opportunity includes a set of recommended resolution steps that describe how to automate the identified opportunity. AI Agent Advisor also maps each resolution step to an existing AI agent on your platform when a match is available. Review the details of an opportunity before deciding whether to deploy an agent for it.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now Assist Center** or **Workspaces** &gt; **Now Assist Center**.

2.  In the AI Agent Advisor section of the home page or in the automation opportunities tab, select an automation opportunity to view its details.

    The Resolution Steps tab opens showing the opportunity details. The page displays summary information for the opportunity, a **Resolution Steps** tab with editable implementation steps, and an **Example Records** tab with example records from the data source.
