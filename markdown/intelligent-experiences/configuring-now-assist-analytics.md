# Configuring Now Assist Analytics

Configure the Now Assist Analytics dashboard to view the usage, value, and performance indicators of Now Assist.

## Configuration overview

Now Assist Analytics requires at least one Now Assist application, for example, Now Assist for Customer Service Management \(CSM\), to be installed and configured on your instance. See [Installing Now Assist Analytics](installing-now-assist-analytics.md) for more information.

The following is an optional configuration task used to map a Now Assist skill to a dashboard.

[Map a skill to a dashboard](map-a-skill-to-a-dashboard.md) to view skill usage and performance indicators.

## Domain Separation

Now Assist Analytics supports domain separation only for indicators using the following data collection jobs.

-   \[GenAI Analytics\] Daily Data Collection
-   \[GenAI Analytics\] Historical Data Collection
-   \[Now Assist Analytics\] Daily Data Collection
-   \[Now Assist Analytics\] Historical Data Collection

See [Approaches to Performance Analytics with domain separation](../now-intelligence/performance-analytics/pa-domain-configurations.md) for more information on applying domain separation configuration.

**Note:** Be sure to check the Run as field in the data collection job records has a valid user.
