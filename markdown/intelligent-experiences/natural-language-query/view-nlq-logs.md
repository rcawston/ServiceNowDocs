# View NLQ logs

Review NLQ logs to see how the system has handled your users' plain-language requests. Use log records from attempted requests to expand NLQ synonyms or shortcuts.

## Before you begin

Role required: nlq\_admin, pa\_analyst, or admin

## About this task

Every natural language query is logged in the **NLQ Query Logs** table \[nlq\_query\_log\]. Each log entry provides details such as the table that was queried, whether the query succeeded, and how the results were generated. Other available fields include the following.

-   Output Source: how the results were generated. The value **BNF** indicates a rules-based method. The value **GAI** indicates the Now LLM Service \(fallback\) method.
-   Source: the location from which the query was initiated. The value **AC** indicates Analytics Overview. The value **CMDB\_WS** indicates CMDB Workspace.
-   Utterance: the original natural-language request which triggered NLQ.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **NLQ** &gt; **Logs**.
