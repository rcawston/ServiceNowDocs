After you run the test by entering the required inputs manually, test results are shown either for a screen orfor entire desktop action in the Execution workspace. While running tests, if you do not see the Execution workspace coming forth, switch to the Execution workspace manually.

While working on a desktop action, the test values you enter are retained across test runs until you close the desktop action or reset the test values.
