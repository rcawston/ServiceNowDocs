# Domain separation and Now Assist Center

Domain separation is supported for Now Assist Center.

Domain separation allows you to separate data, processes, and administrative tasks into logical groupings called domains. You can then control several aspects of this separation, including which users can see and access data.

## Support level: Basic

-   Business logic: Ensure data goes into the proper domain for the application’s service provider \(SP\) use cases.
-   In the application, the user interface, cache keys, reporting, rollups, aggregations, and so on, all use domain at production run time.
-   The owner of the instance must be able to set up the application to function across multiple tenants.

For more information on support levels, see [Application support for domain separation](../platform-security/domain-separated-apps.md).

## Domain separation uses in Now Assist Center
