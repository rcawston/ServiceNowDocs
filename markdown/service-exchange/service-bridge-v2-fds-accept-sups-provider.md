# Accept a foundation data sync \(FDS\) subscription as a provider

Accept a foundation data sync \(FDS\) subscription to complete the FDS configuration and begin receiving data from the consumer.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin \(sb\_admin\)

## About this task

After the subscription items are validated, you must accept the subscription to complete the FDS configuration and activate data synchronization.

If the consumer has enabled auto-publish for the subscription, accepting it will automatically publish the subscription and begin data synchronization. Otherwise, your consumer need to manually publish the subscription before data sync begins.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Exchange Provider** &gt; **Open Records** &gt; **FDS Requests**.

2.  In the **Type: Inbound**, select the request.

3.  From the Foundation Data Provider Inbound Subscriptions related list, open the provider subscription by selecting the record number in the **Number** column.

4.  Select **Accept**.

    If you reject the subscription by selecting **Reject**, your consumer needs to resend the sample files, and you must reconfigure the subscription items before you can accept the subscription again.


## Result

If the consumer has enabled auto-publish, the subscription automatically moves to Active state and data synchronization begins immediately. Otherwise, the subscription remains in Accepted state until the consumer manually publishes it.
