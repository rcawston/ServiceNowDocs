# Validate foundation data sync subscription items

Configure the sample data received from the provider to validate a foundation data sync \(FDS\) subscription item.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

After you create an FDS offering request, the provider acknowledges the request and sends you a sample payload. This payload helps you understand the structure and type of data you’ll receive.

After the provider sends the sample, a subscription is generated for each offering in the FDS offering request and each subscription contains a subscription item for each table the provider is sharing. You must configure the incoming sample data to validate the FDS subscription items.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Exchange Consumer** &gt; **FDS Requests**.

2.  Select the request.

3.  From the Foundation Data Consumer Subscriptions related list, open the consumer subscription by selecting the record number in the **Number** column.

4.  From the Subscription Items related list, open the subscription item by selecting the record number in the **Number** column.

5.  Configure incoming data using either IntegrationHub ETL or a transform map depending on whether you are working with a Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\) or a non-CMDB table.

1.  Select the **ETL Transform Map Assistance** button.

A message is displayed stating that you’re about to navigate to the ETL Transform Map Assistant guided setup.

2.  Confirm your choice by selecting **OK**.
3.  Use the guided setup to complete the mapping to integrate third-party data into CMDB. For details, see [IntegrationHub ETL](../servicenow-platform/integration-hub-etl/integrationhub-etl.md).

**Note:** Since FDS provides display values for reference fields, if you want to use reference data, you must create a table lookup transform mapping to retrieve the Sys ID from the reference table. For more details, see [Foundation Data Sync :: Known issues and workarounds \[KB2299760\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sys_kb_id=8a2b463c873aaadc57288519dabb354b)

4.  Close the browser tab to return to the Subscription Item page.

A message is displayed stating that you’re about to navigate to the Transform Map to complete the configuration.

2.  Confirm your choice by selecting **OK**.
3.  Complete the configuration. For details, see [Create a transform map](../integrate-applications/system-import-sets/t_CreateATransformMap.md).
4.  Close the browser tab to return to the Subscription Item page.
