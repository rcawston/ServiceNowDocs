# Configure Service Exchange for Consumers

As a consumer, follow these steps to set up the Service Exchange for Consumers application in your own instance.

## Pre-installation checks

**Check glide.servlet.uri property**: Ensure that the `glide.servlet.uri` property in the Glide instance is set to the correct instance URL. An issue can occur when an instance is cloned from production, but still refers to the production URL for the `glide.servlet.uri` property.
