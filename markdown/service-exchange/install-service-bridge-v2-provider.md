Role required: admin

The following plugins are automatically installed with the Service Exchange for Providers application:

-   sn\_req\_criteria
-   sn\_sb
-   sn\_sb\_rps

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  Find the Service Exchange for Providers application \(sn\_sb\_pro\) by using the filter criteria and search bar.

    You can search for the application by its name or ID. If you can't find the application, you might have to request it from the ServiceNow Store.

    Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/store-release-notes/page/release-notes/store/sn-store-release-notes.html).

3.  In the application installation dialog, review the application dependencies.

    This listing indicates, for each dependent plugin and application if it's being installed, is already installed, or must be installed. If any plugins or applications must be installed, you must install them before you can install Service Exchange for Providers.

4.  If demo data is available and you want to install it, click **Load demo data**.

    Demo data contains the sample records that describe the application features for common use cases. Load demo data when you first install the application on a development or test instance. If you don't load the demo data during installation, it's unavailable to load later.

5.  Select **Install**.
