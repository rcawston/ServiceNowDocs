# Validate FDS subscriptions items as a provider

Configure the sample data received from the consumer to validate a foundation data sync \(FDS\) subscription item.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin \(sb\_admin\)

## About this task

After you create an FDS offering request, the consumer acknowledges the request and sends you a sample payload. This payload helps you understand the structure and type of data you will receive.

After the consumer sends the sample, the system creates a subscription for each offering in the FDS request. Each subscription includes a subscription item for every table the consumer shares. Configure the incoming sample data to validate each subscription item.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Exchange Provider** &gt; **Open Records** &gt; **FDS Requests**.

2.  From the **Type: Inbound**, select the request.

3.  From the Foundation Data Provider Inbound Subscriptions related list, open the provider subscription by selecting the record number in the **Number** column.

4.  From the Subscription Items related list, open the subscription item by selecting the record number in the **Number** column.

    Each subscription item represents a specific table that the consumer is sharing with you.

5.  Configure incoming data using either IntegrationHub ETL or a transform map depending on whether you are working with a Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\) or a non-CMDB table.

1.  Select the **ETL Transform Map Assistance** button.

A message is displayed stating that you're about to navigate to the ETL Transform Map Assistant guided setup.

2.  Confirm your choice by selecting **OK**.
3.  Use the guided setup to complete the mapping to integrate the consumer's data into your CMDB. For details, see [IntegrationHub ETL](../servicenow-platform/integration-hub-etl/integrationhub-etl.md).

The system creates a basic field mappings based on matching field names. Review and customize the mappings as needed for your instance.

**Note:** Since FDS provides display values for reference fields, if you want to use reference data, you must create a table look up transform mapping to retrieve the Sys ID from the reference table.

4.  Close the browser tab to return to the Subscription Item page.

1.  Select the **Transform Map** button.

A message is displayed stating that you're about to navigate to the Transform Map to complete the configuration.

2.  Confirm your choice by selecting **OK**.
3.  Complete the configuration. For details on working with transform maps, see [Create a transform map](../integrate-applications/system-import-sets/t_CreateATransformMap.md).
4.  Close the browser tab to return to the Subscription Item page.

</table>    You must configure incoming data for each subscription item except dependent subscription items.
