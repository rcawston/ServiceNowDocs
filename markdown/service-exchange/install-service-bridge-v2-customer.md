# Install Service Exchange for Consumers

If you have an admin role, you can install the Service Exchange for Consumers application. The application includes demo data and installations that are related to ServiceNow® Store applications and plugins.

## Before you begin

-   Ensure that the application and all of its associated ServiceNow Store applications have valid ServiceNow entitlements. For more information, see [Get entitlement for a ServiceNow product or application](https://store.servicenow.com/$appstore.do#!/store/help?article=KB0030186).

Role required: admin

## About this task

The following plugins are installed with the Service Exchange for Consumers application:

-   sn\_sb
-   sn\_sb\_rps
-   sn\_transport
-   com.glide.hub.process.sync
-   com.snc.ihub\_spoke\_util\_pack

Apart from these, several components including roles, business rules, tables, and flows are also installed. For more information about the components that are installed with this application, see [Components installed with Service Exchange for Consumers](service-bridge-v2-installed-components-customer.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  Find the Service Exchange for Consumers application by using the filter criteria and search bar.

    You can search for the application by its name or ID. If you can't find the application, you might have to request it from the ServiceNow Store.

    Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/store-release-notes/page/release-notes/store/sn-store-release-notes.html).

3.  If demo data is available and you want to install it, click **Load demo data**.

    Demo data comprises sample records that describe the application features for common use cases. Load demo data when you first install the application on a development or test instance.

    **Important:** If you don't load the demo data during installation, it's unavailable to load later.

4.  Select **Install**.
