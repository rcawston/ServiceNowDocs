# Discovery Admin Workspace Schedules

The Schedules page provides a single place to monitor Discovery performance, efficiently manage schedules and statuses, and set up new IP-based or Cloud Discovery schedules.

To access the Discovery Admin Workspace Schedules page, navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Discovery Admin Workspace** &gt; **Schedules**.

**Note:** The capabilities described here are available in Discovery Admin Workspace v1.13.0. Specific version requirements are noted for individual features where applicable.

## Key features

-   **Quick Discovery option**

    Enables you to perform an IP-based discovery in just a few steps. You can select an IP range, choose the MID selection method, pick the MID Server, and run the discovery all within one interface. This option is available from any tab on the Schedules page.

-   **New Discovery option**

    Enables you to choose how you want to discover your resources, either through IP-based or Cloud-based discovery. This option is available from any tab on the Schedules page.

-   **Overview tab**

    The **Schedules overview** section enables you to make data-driven decisions through powerful visualizations.

    **Note:** You can configure the time scale reflected in the displayed counts on the [Settings](discovery-admin-workspace-setup.md) page.

    Select the **More options** icon \(![More options icon](../../health-log-analytics-operator/image/icon-menu-sow.png)\), then select **Refresh** to refresh the data for each visualization in this section.

</table>-   **IP-based discovery tab**

    Provides a centralized view for monitoring and managing IP‑based Discovery schedules and coverage.

    Depending on your IPv6 IP Address Management \(IPAM\) integration, items that require attention are displayed, such as IPs that aren't currently covered by Discovery schedules or schedules that were auto created from IPAM that require activation. Select **Review missing coverage** to access the [CMDB Coverage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/configuration-management-database-cmdb/cmdb-coverage.md) page where you can view coverage analysis results and create Discovery schedules from IP Ranges. If you haven't enabled auto-created Discovery schedules via IPAM, select **Review in Settings** to access the [Discovery Admin Workspace Settings](discovery-admin-workspace-setup.md) page. When auto‑created schedules are enabled, a notification displays the number of Discovery schedules that require activation. Select **View and activate schedules** to open the Auto‑created schedules page. For details on activating these schedules, see [Activate auto-created Discovery schedules](activate-auto-disco-schedule.md). For more information about IPv6 IPAM integration, see [IPAM Discovery integration](ipv6-ipam-disco-integration.md).

    IP resources are available via Additional information. Select the **Total IP address** link to access a [CMDB Coverage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/configuration-management-database-cmdb/cmdb-coverage.md) analysis.

    **Note:** You must have the CMDB Coverage application v1.0.0 installed to access this link.

    Select the **All IP range sets** to access the Discovery Range Sets \[discovery\_range\] table.

    Select a Discovery schedule from the table to view extensive details and update schedule field parameters. For more information, see [Discovery Admin Workspace schedule details](discovery-admin-workspace-schedules.md#).

-   **Cloud discovery tab**

    Gives you quick access to all of your cloud-based Discovery schedules.

    Select a Discovery schedule from the table to view extensive details and update schedule field parameters. For more information, see [Discovery Admin Workspace schedule details](discovery-admin-workspace-schedules.md#).

-   **Discovery status tab**

    Shows the status of scheduled discoveries. You can select a Discovery status number to view detailed information. For more details, see [Discovery Admin Workspace status details](discovery-admin-workspace-schedules.md#).

## Discovery Admin Workspace status details

The Discovery Status Details page offers a summary of a discovery initiated from a schedule, detailing the devices identified, any errors encountered, and any anomalies found.

To access Discovery status details in Discovery Admin Workspace, navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Discovery Admin Workspace** &gt; **Schedules** &gt; **Discovery status**.

**Note:** The capabilities described here are available in Discovery Admin Workspace v1.8.0 or later. Specific version requirements are noted for individual features where applicable.
