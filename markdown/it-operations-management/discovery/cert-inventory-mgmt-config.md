# Configuring Certificate Inventory and Management

Establish a streamlined process for gaining insights into Certificate Inventory Management, covering key aspects like certificate discovery, bulk upload functionality, maintenance of certificate chain relationships, configuration of Credential Identifiers, customization of the system, creation of new/renewal requests, archiving tasks, automation of TLS certificate management, integration with Event Management, Slack notifications for alerts, and leveraging cert-Manager for efficient certificate generation.

## Configuration overview

Before using Certificate Inventory and Management, it's crucial to set up the necessary plugins, ensure activation, upgrade your instance to the latest version, and download the Certificate Inventory and Management application from ServiceNow Store.
