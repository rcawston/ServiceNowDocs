</table>**Note:** Daily aggregation jobs update domain-level metrics, including total page views and last accessed time. Data may not reflect activity from the current day until the job has run.

## Targeted URLs visited

This section lists the targeted URLs visited across managed devices since a given date. Targeted URLs are those configured for monitoring in **Workspaces** &gt; **Discovery Admin Workspace** &gt; **Settings** &gt; **URL Discovery**. For more information, see [Discovery Admin Workspace Settings](discovery-admin-workspace-setup.md).

Select a URL from the list to view detailed information about it. Select the filter icon \(![filter icon](../image/filter-icon-daw.png)\) to apply filters to the table.

## Other URLs visited

The Broad URLs visited list displays URLs accessed on managed devices that are not in the targeted URLs list and is populated only when broad URL discovery is enabled. The list includes the URL and the number of hits recorded for each domain. To add a URL to your targeted discovery list, select the check box next to the URL and select **Add to targeted discovery**. In the dialog, enter the following information:

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Internal or External|Indicates whether the domain is internal or external. The default value is External.|
|Category|The URL category to assign to the domain.|
|Product|The product associated with the domain.|
|Publisher|The publisher of the product associated with the domain.|
|Application Service|The application service associated with the domain.|

Select **Save** to add the URL to the Targeted URL discovery. The URL is then monitored and appears in the **Targeted URLs visited** tab.

Select the filter icon \(![filter icon](../image/filter-icon-daw.png)\) to apply filters to the table.
