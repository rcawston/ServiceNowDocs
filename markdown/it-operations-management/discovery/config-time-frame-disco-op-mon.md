# Configure the date range for a Discovery Operations Monitor visualization

Update the data time frame for individual visualizations on the Discovery Operations Monitor dashboard. By default, each visualization displays data from the last 7 days. You can extend the time frame up to 30 days, which is the maximum data retention period for this dashboard.

Verify you're using Discovery Admin Workspace v1.15.0.

Role required: discovery\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Discovery Admin Workspace** &gt; **Insights** &gt; **Discovery Operations Monitor**.

2.  Select **Edit**.

3.  Select the visualization you want to update.

4.  In the Configuration panel, under Data Sources, select the data source card for the visualization you want to update.

    The Edit data source page displays.

5.  In the Filters section, select **Edit**.

6.  Select the **Last 7 Days** drop-down list to choose a new time frame for the filter condition.

    **Warning:** The list includes options beyond 30 days, but the dashboard retains data for a maximum of 30 days. Selecting a longer time frame doesn't display additional data.
