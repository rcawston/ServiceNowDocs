# Discovery Admin Workspace Home

The Discovery Admin Workspace Home page features tools to help you identify and address the most critical discovery tasks. Access critical information and applications to assess discovery, manage the discovery process, and resolve any related errors.

To access the Discovery Admin Workspace, navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Discovery Admin Workspace**.

**Note:** The capabilities described here are available in Discovery Admin Workspace v1.8.0 or later. Specific version requirements are noted for individual features where applicable.

## Quick overview

View the status of discovery using data counts and identify any irregularities that might impact discovery. For detailed information, select the appropriate tile.

Select the **More options** icon \(![More options icon](../../health-log-analytics-operator/image/icon-menu-sow.png)\), then select **Refresh** to refresh the data for each visualization in this section.

**Note:** You can configure the time scale reflected in the displayed counts on the [Settings](discovery-admin-workspace-setup.md) page.

The following data counts display in the Quick overview section:

-   **Active schedules**

    Displays the number of active IP-based and Cloud Discovery schedules run to date.

-   **Error tasks**

    Displays the active, including pending or in-progress, Discovery error tasks opened in a certain time period. Selecting this number redirects you to the Case management tab on the [Diagnostics](discovery-admin-workspace-diagnostics.md) page, where you can view all Discovery error tasks.

-   **Schedules with anomalies**

    Displays the number of Discovery schedules with anomalies detected over a certain time period. This count only displays when anomaly detection is enabled. If anomaly detection is inactive, select **Turn on** to access the [Settings](discovery-admin-workspace-setup.md) page.

    Selecting this number redirects you to the Anomaly detection tab on the [Diagnostics](discovery-admin-workspace-diagnostics.md) page, where you can view details about the type and severity of anomalies.

-   **Discovery Operations Monitor**

    Monitor discovery performance across your IT environment. Select **View dashboard** to open the dashboard and view performance metrics for transactions, sensor jobs, MID Server queue load, and probe processing times. For more information, see [Discovery Operations Monitor dashboard](disco-operations-monitor.md).

    **Note:** This feature is available starting in Discovery Admin Workspace v1.15.0.


## Discovery admin tasks

Review the three most critical Discovery error tasks. Select the **Edit Task** button to access the details page where you can assign or update the error task, or add work notes. To view and manage all discovery error tasks, select **View all** to access the Case management tab on the [Diagnostics](discovery-admin-workspace-diagnostics.md) page.

**Note:** This section focuses solely on Discovery errors that have associated tasks and not all Discovery errors.

## Discovery tuning advice

Fine-tune Discovery and MID Server settings with automated suggestions derived from scans of your instance. These findings identify potential issues, arranged in order of their criticality. Selecting a finding redirects you to the **Tuning check** page for more details. To view all tuning checks and latest reports, select **View all** to access the [Tuning](discovery-admin-workspace-tuning.md) page.

## Quick Discovery

Discover devices in your network outside of a scheduled discovery. Enter a single IP address, multiple comma-separated IP addresses, or an IP network as shown in this example:

-   IP network address - 10.0.1.0/24
-   IP address range - 10.0.2.1-10.0.2.15
-   IP address list - 10.0.3.176,10.0.3.222,2001::100,2600:1bdc::fffe

Select a MID Server, a MID cluster, or enable Discovery to select the MID Server automatically.

## Discovery Guided Setup

The ITOM Discovery Guided Setup leads you through a structured series of configuration activities to promote accurate visibility in the CMDB and establish a strong foundation for IT operations. If you're setting up Discovery for the first time, this is a good way to get your environment up and running quickly. For more information, see [Discovery Guided Setup](discovery-guided-setup.md).

**Note:** This feature is available starting in Discovery Admin Workspace v1.12.0.

## ITOM Visibility apps

Enhance the functionality of the Discovery Admin Workspace by integrating additional ITOM Visibility applications. When you select **View all**, you can view both the applications installed on your instance and others that are available for installation.

**Note:** Updating applications requires you to have the admin role.

While you can access details about the apps installed on your instance, information regarding pricing and packages isn’t provided, as it varies based on each contract. For a general overview of licensing and subscription details, see [ITOM/OT SU Licensing and subscriptions](../itom-su-licensing-landing-page.md).
