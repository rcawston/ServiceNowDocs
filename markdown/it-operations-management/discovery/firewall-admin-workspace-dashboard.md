# Firewall Admin Workspace dashboard

The unified dashboard enables security and risk teams to oversee tasks, change requests, and the entire firewall inventory life cycle, with daily or manual updates for accurate and current information.

## Firewall Insights tab

The **Insights** tab offers a snapshot of firewall policies and associated devices, showcasing trends in policies without owners over time. Track new and unaudited policies, and view the distribution of device manufacturers and models within the network.

## Requests and Audits tab

Within the **Tasks** tab, explore the **Requests** and **Audits** sub-tabs. The **Requests** tab provides breakdowns of request tasks by state and ownership, along with fulfillment trends over time. Similarly, the **Audits** tab displays outstanding audits by state and ownership, along with response trends over time.
