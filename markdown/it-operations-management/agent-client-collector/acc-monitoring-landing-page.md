# Agent Client Collector Monitoring

Agent Client Collector Monitoring enables you to monitor your service availability, examine the health and performance of your environment, and ensure that your infrastructure and its applications are running properly.

## Get started

**Note:**

If checks are not running on the agent's devices, your agent may be in CPU protection mode. CPU protection mode is activated automatically when a device's CPU consumption is too high for one of two reasons: either the user is running too many checks, or the machine is under-resourced. When it happens, the agent's Data Collection status turns to Off. ACC-F generates an event and records it in a log. To manually resume data collection by the ACC agent, see [Pause Agent Client Collector data collection](acc-enable-silent-mode.md).

The user needs to monitor the activity of the ACC to resolve the issue through manual intervention and then re-enable ACC collection. To setup the ACC monitoring, see [Enable Agent Client Collector monitoring on the MID Server](acc-monitoring-setup.md).
