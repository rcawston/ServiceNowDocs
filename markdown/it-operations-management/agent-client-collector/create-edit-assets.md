-   **[Secure a custom plugin with a certificate](acc-self-sign-certificate.md)**  
When you customize or create an Agent Client Collector plugin, you can secure the plugin with either a third-party certificate or an internal secure certificate in the plugin's script. Official plugins are signed by an external certificate authority.
