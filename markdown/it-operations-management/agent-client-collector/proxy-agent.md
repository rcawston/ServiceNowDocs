# Using proxy agents in Agent Client Collector

You can use a proxy agent to monitor the health and performance of your configuration items \(CIs\) even if the agent is in the cloud or any place that is external to your host server.

Proxy agents are used to monitor:

-   URLs \(to ensure that the URLs are available and accessible\)
-   Services that don't have a host server
-   Closed services on which you can’t configure an agent
-   External databases in the cloud

One agent can monitor multiple entities and their CIs.

The following diagram shows the connection between a ServiceNow instance, the MID Server, and Agent Client Collector agents, as well as proxy agents that monitor CIs that are external to the agent.

You can configure the proxy agent to do a custom check when it is monitoring external entities. To learn how to create custom checks, see [Create and edit checks](view-checks.md).

You can create a cluster of proxy agents on multiple proxy servers to monitor the services that are external to the host server. To learn how to create a proxy agent cluster, see [Create a proxy agent cluster](configure-agent-proxy-cluster.md).

Use a Proxy Auto-Configuration \(PAC\) file to dynamically determine the appropriate proxy server to use. PAC files provide flexible and automated proxy configuration, enabling the agent to use different proxies for different destinations, connect directly to internal resources, implement complex proxy routing logic, and to automatically handle proxy failover. For details on the parameters used for PAC file configuration, see [Configuration file options](acc-yml-options.md).

Following is a sample PAC file:

```
function FindProxyForURL (url, host) {

   // Connect directly to internal hosts
   if (isPlainHostName(host) ||
      shExpMatch(host, "*.internal.company.com")) {
      return "DIRECT";
   }

   // use proxy for all other hosts
   return "PROXY proxy.company.com:8080:
}

```

-   **[Configure an agent on a proxy server](configure-agent-proxy-server.md)**  
Configure an Agent Client Collector on a proxy server when monitoring services external to the host server, such as URLs or external databases in the cloud.
-   **[Create a proxy agent cluster](configure-agent-proxy-cluster.md)**  
Create a cluster of agents on multiple proxy servers to monitor services external to the host server. Creating a cluster of agents enables you to assign that cluster to multiple policies instead of having to assign the agents individually to every policy.
-   **[Assign a proxy agent cluster to a policy](assign-proxy-cluster-policy.md)**  
Assign a proxy agent cluster to a policy when monitoring services external to the host server, such as URLs or external databases in the cloud. The agents in the cluster monitor all of the policy's CIs.
