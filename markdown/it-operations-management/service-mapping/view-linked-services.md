# View dependent application services in classic Service Mapping

Check which application services depend on an application service and open maps for dependent application services.

## Before you begin

Roles required: service\_mapping\_user

## About this task

The service that contains a reference to another service instance, becomes a dependent service. The service that you include as a reference is a contained service.
