# View contained application services in classic Service Mapping

A contained application service is a reference included into another, dependent application service. You can open the contained service map directly from within the dependent service map.

## Before you begin

Roles required: service\_mapping\_user

## About this task

The service that contains a reference to another service instance, becomes a dependent service. The service that you include as a reference is a contained service.

## Procedure

1.  Open the service instance map.

    1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **CSDM** &gt; **Manage Technology Management Services** &gt; **Service Instance**.

    2.  Select the needed service instance.

    3.  On the service instance page, select **View Map**.

2.  Right-click the CI that is the contained service, and select **Show contained service**.

    The map shows an automatic redirection to the web address for the contained service. No additional tabs need to open.
