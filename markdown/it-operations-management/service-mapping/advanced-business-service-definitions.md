# Application service completion

After an application service is reviewed and approved, you can define attributes that enhance its discovery, reflect its importance, and control access to it.

There are several configurations you must perform to complete definition of an application service.

-   **[Define criticality for application services](define-criticality-for-business-services.md)**  
For each service instance, select a criticality level that reflects how important it is to your organization operations.
-   **[Group application services](organizing_services-into-groups.md)**  
Organize application services by groups to perform actions simultaneously on multiple services, and to control user access to services. You can use Event Management to track service health by service groups.
-   **[Control user access to application services](control-user-access-to-business-services.md)**  
Assign user roles to service groups to grant users access to application services in your organization. Your organization may restrict access to some services for security or secrecy reasons.
-   **[Schedule a top-down discovery by Service Mapping](t_CreateDiscoSchedForCITypes.md)**  
After Service Mapping discovers configuration items \(CIs\) belonging to your service instance for the first time, it then rediscovers CIs to find changes and updates. Create or modify discovery schedules to control how often Service Mapping rediscovers services or CIs. For example, you may create custom discovery schedules to avoid redundant stress on the infrastructure.
-   **[Service definition transfer from one instance to another](transfer-service-definitions.md#)**  
Save time and effort by exporting definitions of service instances from the source instance and importing these definitions into the target instance. You can use this method to copy definitions of service instances only of the discovered type.
