# Set up data inputs in Health Log Analytics using guided setup

The Health Log Analytics guided setup provides a sequence of tasks to help you create data inputs on your ServiceNow instance. Data input configuration is an essential step in setting up the Health Log Analytics application. Using guided setup ensures that you have the minimum required setup for the data input process.

## Before you begin

**Important:** Health Log Analytics does not support IPv6. To work with the application, configure the MID Server to IPv4.

-   Verify that a MID Server is installed and configured with the Log Ingestion capability enabled. For more information, see [MID Server system requirements](../../servicenow-platform/mid-server/r_MIDServerSystemRequirements.md).

    **Important:** Health Log Analytics does not support IPv6. To work with the application, configure the MID Server to IPv4.

-   Unless the MID Server and external clients are on the same network, the MID Server must have a public IP address. This is required when its IP is exposed through network address translation \(NAT\), a load balancer, or a similar device. The public IP address enables external clients, such as Filebeat agents located outside its network, to reach the MID Server. Private IP addresses are not routable over the internet. Without a public IP, external clients cannot connect to the MID Server even if they are configured with its address. In the MID Server properties, add a property named **mid.public\_ip** with the public IP address as the value. For more information, see [Create a MID Server property](../../servicenow-platform/mid-server/r_MIDServerProperties.md). If the MID Server and external clients are on the same network, connections can be made using the private IP address.
-   For shipping your logs encrypted using SSL TLS, see the [Streaming Data With Rsyslog &amp; Filebeat Using SSL \[KB0866319\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0866319) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

-   For MID Server proxy requirements, see [MID Server proxy preconditions for streaming logs to Health Log Analytics](hla-mid-proxy-configure.md).
