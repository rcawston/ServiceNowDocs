# Set up integrations for Health Log Analytics from the Integrations Launchpad

Set up integrations from the Event Management Integrations Launchpad in Service Operations Workspace for ITOM.

## Integrations Launchpad

The Integrations Launchpad tool provides a unified interface for convenient integration with connectors that feed raw log messages from external sources into your ServiceNow instance for processing and analysis. For more information, see [Integrations Launchpad in Service Operations Workspace for ITOM](../service-operations-workspace-for-itom-apps/integrations-launchpad.md).

## Integrations for Health Log Analytics

The Integrations Launchpad enables the following integrations for Health Log Analytics:

-   **Pull integrations**

    These integrations pull log data from external data sources and stream the data to your instance, typically via a MID Server. Select an integration in the table to open a page with the setup procedure.
