# Information on the Overview tab for a Log Analytics alert

The alert **Overview** tab in Health Log Analytics helps you understand Log Analytics alerts.

## Sections and cards on the Overview tab for Log Analytics alerts

For a detailed description of Log Analytics alerts , see [Types of Health Log Analytics alerts](hla-op-log-analytics-alert-types.md).

-   **Identified issue**

    The "identified issue" led to the alert. The issue appears in the title for the alert and on a card on the tab. Information about the alert appears in the banner.

    ![Identified issue appears here and in alert title.](../image/identified-issue-card-loganalytics-alert.png "Identified issue")

    -   Select **Details** for more information about the alert.
    -   Select **View surrounding logs** to view the log lines that were generated one minute before and one minute after the alert. See [Analyze log lines that surround an anomaly in Health Log Analytics](hla-op-surrounding-logs-view-sow.md).
-   **Configuration Items**

    To view more detailed information on the CI that is associated with the alert, click the **Configuration Items** tab or click **View more** in the Configuration Items section. See [Operator phase 1: Analyze and acknowledge an alert](../event-management/operator-phase-acknowledge-analyze.md).

-   **Impacted services**

    To view detailed information on the services that are impacted by the alerts, select the **Impacted services** tab. See [Operator phase 1: Analyze and acknowledge an alert](../event-management/operator-phase-acknowledge-analyze.md).

-   **Anomaly**

    The Anomaly card illustrates the anomalous activity that led to the alert. The chart shows:

    -   Recent anomalous activity
    -   Expected behavior \(the learned baseline\)
    -   Baseline values from one day earlier
    -   Baseline values from the previous week
    In this example, the system tracks the baseline rate \(the average number of events per minute\) for a specific log pattern. When this typically inactive log generates a spike in events, the system detects the deviation from the baseline and generates an alert.

    ![Anomaly card identifies and illustrates anomalous behavior.](../image/anomaly-spike.png "Anomaly card")

    In this example, the blue line represents the current average number of events per minute. The orange-shaded area represents the baseline values for the same hour in the previous week.

    For more information on the kinds of anomalies that you might encounter, see [Types of anomalous behavior in Health Log Analytics](hla-op-anomalous-behavior-types.md).

-   **Meaningful log properties**

    On the Meaningful log properties card, each bar chart shows the distribution of values for a single log property that contributed to the anomaly. Each property value is associated with a color. The length of a color bar correlates to the percentage that the property value holds in comparison with all other values for the property. For the **p\_a5** property in the example, the value **EUR** appeared in 56.12% of log lines, **GBP** in 13.67%, and so on.

    ![Meaningful log properties shows the relative frequency of occurrence for property values.](../image/meaningful-log-properties-card.png "Meaningful log properties")

-   **Top alerts**

    The Top alerts card displays summaries of data from the **Similar alerts** and **Repeated alerts** tabs. The Total results value is the sum of the two values. select **More details** to open the **Alert Insight Similar Alerts** tab. For details, see [Information on the Alert Insight Similar Alerts tab](hla-op-alrt-inst-simlr-alrts-tab.md).

    ![Top alerts shows counts of total, similar, and repeated alerts.](../image/top-alerts-card.png "Top alerts")

-   **Top incidents**

    The Top incidents card displays summaries of data from the **Incidents on CI** and **Incidents on related CIs** tabs. The Total results value is the sum of the two values. select **More details** to open the **Incidents on CI** tab.

    ![Top incidents shows counts of total results, incidents on CI, and incidents on related CIs.](../image/top-incidents-card.png "Top incidents")
