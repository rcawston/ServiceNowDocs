# Set up an Edge Delta REST integration for Health Log Analytics

Set up an Edge Delta REST integration to enable Health Log Analytics to process logs it receives from Edge Delta in a distinct format. These logs stream into your ServiceNow instance via REST.

## Before you begin

-   Verify that a MID Server is installed and configured with the Log Ingestion capability enabled. For more information, see [MID Server system requirements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/mid-server/r_MIDServerSystemRequirements.md).

    **Important:** Health Log Analytics does not support IPv6. To work with the application, configure the MID Server to IPv4.

-   Unless the MID Server and external clients are on the same network, the MID Server must have a public IP address. This is required when its IP is exposed through network address translation \(NAT\), a load balancer, or a similar device. The public IP address enables external clients, such as Filebeat agents located outside its network, to reach the MID Server. Private IP addresses are not routable over the internet. Without a public IP, external clients cannot connect to the MID Server even if they are configured with its address. In the MID Server properties, add a property named **mid.public\_ip** with the public IP address as the value. For more information, see [Create a MID Server property](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/mid-server/r_MIDServerProperties.md). If the MID Server and external clients are on the same network, connections can be made using the private IP address.

## About this task

If your organization uses Edge Delta to handle large volumes of log data from multiple sources before sending it to Health Log Analytics, the log format HLA receives from Edge Delta is different from other types. The Edge Delta integration enables HLA to detect and separate transport headers from inner log messages in this format, forwarding only the inner message to the source type structure for processing.

You set up integrations through the Integrations Launchpad in Service Operations Workspace, which you access from the ITOM AIOps configuration center. The AIOps configuration center is a centralized workspace for configuring and managing AIOps features from a single place. The integrations setup process reduces implementation time compared to manual data input setup in the classic interface in Health Log Analytics. For more information, see [Integrations Launchpad in Service Operations Workspace for ITOM](../service-operations-workspace-for-itom-apps/integrations-launchpad.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Service Operations Workspace**.

2.  From the bottom of the navigation pane, select the AIOps configuration center icon ![ITOM AIOps configuration center icon](../image/icon-itom-aiops-config.png).

    The ITOM AIOps configuration center page appears. The configuration center is a centralized workspace. Use it to configure and manage AIOps features from a single place.

3.  From the Integrate section, under Integrations, select **Add integration**.

    The Integrations Launchpad appears.

4.  In the **Browse integrations** tab, enter `Edge Delta` in the search field.

5.  Select the Edge Delta REST integration tile.

    **Note:** If you start an integration setup before meeting all prerequisites, a message appears. You can cancel the setup and complete the prior requirements first. Alternatively, you can continue in draft mode and complete the requirements later. Note that you can't activate the integration until you have completed all the prerequisites.

6.  On the **Provide details** form, fill in the fields.

    For a description of the fields, see [Edge Delta REST integration configuration fields](il-connector-hla-edgedelta-rest-fields.md).

7.  Select **Next**.

8.  Follow the instructions in the **Set-up instruction** page to install the integration in the 3rd party console.

    1.  Copy the displayed URL.
    2.  In Edge Delta, create an HTTP destination.
    3.  Paste the copied URL into the HTTP destination.
    4.  Add the following headers:
        -   Authorization

            Use either of the following:

            -   Key &lt;API\_KEY&gt;

                Find the API\_KEY by navigating to **All** &gt; **MID Web Server API Key** &gt; **View API Key**.

            -   Basic &lt;Base64 \(username:password\)&gt;

                **Note:** Verify that you use a username and password for a MID web server with Basic Auth enabled.

        -   Content-Type: application/json.
9.  Do one of the following:

    -   If you completed all the prerequisites before starting the configuration, select **Activate**.

        When the integration is activated successfully, the **Overview** tab is displayed. On the Integrations Launchpad, the integration tile is available in the **Installed integrations** tab.

    -   If you didn't complete all the prior requirements, select **Save draft**.

        The system saves the integration as a draft in the Integrations Launchpad. It appears in the **Installed integrations** tab, under **Waiting for your action**. You can complete the prerequisites and activate the integration later. For more information, see [Activate a draft integration in Health Log Analytics](il-connector-hla-activate-draft.md).


## What to do next

On the **Overview** tab, do the following:

-   Use the displayed information to refine how Health Log Analytics reads the log data. For more information, see [Review log streaming data and adjust integration settings in Health Log Analytics](il-connector-overview-tab.md).
-   Use the More options menu \(![More options menu icon.](../image/more-options.png)\) to open the **Data Input Mapping**, **Source Type Structures**, or **Log Sources** pages with context from the integration. If your log data is not properly mapped, structured, or sourced, go back and adjust the configuration. If the Service Operations Workspace Log Analytics application is installed, the More options menu also provides direct access to the **Log Viewer**. Use the **Log Viewer** to review raw log messages ingested by the integration. For more information, see:
    -   [Log data auto-mapping and mapping](hla-data-input-automapping.md)
    -   [Source type structure adjustment](hla-source-type-structure-adjustment.md)
    -   [Review logs on the Log Viewer](../service-operations-workspace-for-itom-apps/hla-op-logs-log-viewer-concept-sow.md)
