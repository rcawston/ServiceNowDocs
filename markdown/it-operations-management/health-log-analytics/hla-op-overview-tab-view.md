# Start remediation of a Log Analytics alert from the Overview tab

Begin the remediation process of a Log Analytics alert from the alert **Overview** tab. This tab provides information on the alert, the log data associated with the anomalous behavior, CIs associated with the alert, and services impacted by it.

## Before you begin

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_operator, or evt\_mgmt\_user, or evt\_mgmt\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Service Operations Workspace**.

2.  In the Service Operations Workspace, select the lists icon \(![Lists icon.](../image/icon-lists-sow.png)\).

3.  Select the appropriate list in the Alerts sub-list and navigate to the relevant alert or group.

    All Health Log Analytics alerts have the value **Log Analytics** in the **Source** column. The value in the **Group** column identifies the type of Log Analytics alert. See [Types of Health Log Analytics alerts](hla-op-log-analytics-alert-types.md) for a more detailed description of each type of alert or group.

    **Tip:** To preview an alert in the list, click its info icon \(![Info icon.](../image/icon-info.png)\).

4.  Select the alert number.

    The **Overview** tab displays.

5.  View the section of the **Overview** tab that provides the information that you need.

    For a description of the sections and cards, see [Sections and cards on the alert Overview tab in Health Log Analytics](hla-alert-overview-tab.md).

    **Note:** Because some sections on the **Overview** tab show only a portion of the information, many sections include a link that displays different or more complete information.

6.  Run predefined remediation tasks to resolve alert issues.

    1.  Select **Launch playbook**.
    2.  Select the **Playbook** tab.

        The **Run remediation** card displays the available remediation actions.

    3.  Select the tile corresponding to the action you want to run.
    When the action is complete, it appears in the **Completed** card.
