# Create a MID Server user

Create a user account with the mid\_server role so MID Servers can authenticate and communicate with the ServiceNow instance.

## Before you begin

Verify the following:

-   You have installed the ITOM Visibility plugin. For more information, see [Install ITOM Visibility using Now Assist for Setup](install-nowassist-setup-itom-visibility.md).
-   You have installed the Now Assist for IT Operations Management plugin. For more information, see [Install Now Assist for IT Operations Management](install-now-assist-itom.md).
-   You're on the Configure IT Operations Management page of the Configuration Console. For more information, see [Access the ITOM Configuration Console](access-itom-config-console-disco.md).

## About this task

MID Servers require a MID Server user account to authenticate with the instance. Assigning the mid\_server role allows the MID Server to connect and pass validation checks. ServiceNow monitors MID Server user settings to help prevent validation failures. You can use a dedicated user per MID Server or share a user across multiple MID Servers.

**Note:** Using the same logged‑in user across multiple MID Servers can generate issue records when more than one MID Server is **Up**. Configure a unique logged‑in user per MID Server. See [\(KB1552863\) MID Server Unique Logged In User](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1552863) for more information and remediation steps.
