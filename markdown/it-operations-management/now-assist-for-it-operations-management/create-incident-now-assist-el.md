# Create an incident from an alert with Now Assist in Express List

Create an incident with a human-readable, AI-generated description from the Express List pane by using Now Assist.

## Before you begin

**Note:** Currently, Now Assist for ITOM only supports tag-based, CMDB, Log Analytics, Mixed, Automated, and Network Traffic-based alert groups. For all other alert group types, it only analyzes the parent alert.

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_operator, evt\_mgmt\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Service Operations Workspace**.

2.  From the navigation bar, select the Express list icon ![](../../event-management/image/express-list1.png).

3.  Create an incident from a selected alert.

    1.  In the Express List pane, select the alert.

        **Note:** To display the individual alerts inside a group, select the chevron icon \(![Chevron icon.](../../service-operations-workspace-itom/image/icon-chevron.png)\) at the beginning of the alert group row.

    2.  Select the **Alert actions** drop-down list.
