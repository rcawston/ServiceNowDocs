To use the Alert Hypothesizer described in [Analyze alerts using the ITOM MCP Server with MCP client applications](review-alerts-using-itom-mcp-server.md), you must also install Health Log Analytics plugin.

To use the CI reliability and SLO tools described in [Review CI reliability with the ITOM MCP Server](review-ci-reliability-itom-mcp-server.md), you must also have the following plugins installed:

-   Service Reliability Management \(sn\_sow\_srm\)
