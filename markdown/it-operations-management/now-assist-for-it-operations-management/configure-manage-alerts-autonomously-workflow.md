# Configure the manage alerts autonomously agentic workflow

Configure an alert management rule to operate the manage alerts autonomously agentic workflow manually or automatically.

## Before you begin

-   [Install Now Assist for IT Operations Management \(ITOM\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/install-now-assist-feature-plugins.md). For more information about installing Now Assist plugins, see [Install Now Assist plugins](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/install-now-assist-feature-plugins.md).

Agentic workflows and their AI agents use [role masking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/aia-role-masking.md) to determine which users can access them. Ones installed with Now Assist applications have specific roles that come included with the application. If you select **Users with specific roles** for user access, you must configure the security controls to include these roles. For the instructions to change the security controls, see [Define security controls for an agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/define-sec-controls-aw.md).

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_admin, evt\_mgmt\_operator

## About this task

Configure the autonomous workflow alert management rule to operate the manage alerts autonomously agentic workflow manually or automatically. For more information about alert management rules, see [Alert management rules for resolving alerts](../event-management/alert-management-rule.md).

When the workflow operates automatically, alerts are addressed as they’re created and AI insight information is displayed in Express List.

When the workflow operates manually, users must manually generate AI insights. For more information, see [Review AI generated alert information and insights in Express List](use-ai-insights-express-list.md).

For more information about the manage alerts autonomously agentic workflow, see [Manage alerts autonomously agentic workflow](itom-autonomous-operator-workflow.md).

**Note:**

If you change the alert management rule for the manage alert autonomously workﬂow, you must update the **sn\_aiops\_ai\_agents.autonomous\_alert\_rule\_sys\_id** property, which points to the alert management rule.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Service Operations Workspace**.

2.  From the bottom of the navigation pane, select the AIOps configuration center icon ![ITOM AIOps configuration center icon](../../health-log-analytics-admin/image/icon-itom-aiops-config.png).

    The ITOM AIOps configuration center page appears. The configuration center is a centralized workspace. Use it to configure and manage AIOps features from a single place.

3.  On the ITOM AIOps configuration center page, under the Optimize section, select **Respond to alerts**.

    The Respond page appears.
