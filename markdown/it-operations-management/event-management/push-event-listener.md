# Configure a push connector

You can configure listeners and connectors to push event information to the instance or MID Server.

Event Management receives external events through a push connector or script. If you are using a script to collect events, no configuration is required. All other methods of collecting events require configuration.

After event collection configuration, Event Management can collect events that are sent directly to the instance, or via the MID Server, SNMP trap, or email.

**Note:** Integrating with push connectors is only available by installing the Event Management Connector plugin from the ServiceNow Store.

## Standard event form

All events must use a standard event form, regardless of how they arrive at the instance. For more information, see [Event field format for event collection](c_EMIntegrateRequirementEvent.md).

## Event collection

Event Management facilitates communication and movement of data between external applications, data sources, services, and the ServiceNow AI Platform instance.
