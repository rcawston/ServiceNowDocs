# Limit the records for the SLA configuration filter

If too many records are returned by the SLA configuration filter, you can add a property to set the maximum number of records.

## Before you begin

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_admin

## About this task

By default, the size of dynamic CI group records is limited to 10,000 elements. Exceeding this limit can affect system stability. If the filter configuration for a specified dynamic CI group returns too many records, you can limit the number of records that are returned by setting the value of the sa.qbs.max\_num\_of\_cis property. For more information, see [Create a Dynamic CI Group](../../servicenow-platform/configuration-management-database-cmdb/create-it-services.md).

## Procedure

1.  Enter `sys_properties.list` in the application navigator.

2.  Add the following property:

    **sa.qbs.max\_num\_of\_cis**

3.  Set the value to an integer that represents the maximum number of records to return.
