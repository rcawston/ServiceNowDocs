# Configure RFC in SAP Solution Manager

As part of enabling communication with Event Management, you must create a Remote Function Call \(RFC\) in the SAP Solution Manager and install a transport.

## Before you begin

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_admin

Download the following .psm files and import them into the SAP Solution Manager system.

## Procedure

1.  On the SAP UI, enter the transaction code `SM59` and create a new RFC with the following parameters on the **Technical Settings** tab:

    |SAP Parameter|Value|
    |-------------|-----|
    |RFC Destination|MID\_EVENT\_COLLECTOR2|
    |Target Host|Name of the MID Server.|
    |Service No|Listener port on the MID Server|
    |Path Prefix|The URL of the MID Server transform script: `/api/mid/em/inbound_event?Transform=TransformEvents_SAPSolman`|

    ![SAP Event Collector form](../image/sap-solman-event-collector.png "Technical Settings tab")

2.  On the **Logon &amp; Security** tab, select **Basic Authentication** and enter your Event Management logon credentials in the **User** and **Password** fields.

    A custom SAP BADI \(Business Add-in\) named Z\_ALRT\_REACTION\_IMPL is created and stored as a workbench transport request. After installation, this BADI calls the RFC to connect to Event Management.
