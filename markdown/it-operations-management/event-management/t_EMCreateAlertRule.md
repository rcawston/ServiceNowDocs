# Migrate an alert action rule to an alert management rule

Existing alert action rules from an earlier release can be executed, but cannot be modified. Alert action rules that have been migrated become alert management rules and all the definitions of the alert action rules are migrated to the alert management rule format. Migrated rules can be modified.

## Before you begin

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_admin

## About this task

Existing alert action rules are active, read-only rules. An alert action rule can be modified only after it is migrated to an alert management rule.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Event Management** &gt; **Rules** &gt; **Alert Action Rules**.

2.  Select an alert action rule to migrate or delete.

3.  Click **Migrate**.

    If you clicked **Migrate**, the list of migrated rules can be found, together with new alert management rules, by navigating to **Event Management** &gt; **Rules** &gt; **Alert Management**.

    After a successful migration, all the definitions of the alert action rules are migrated to the alert management rule format.


## Result

When an alert action rule has been migrated successfully, the alert action rule can no longer be modified. However, the new alert management rule can be modified.

## What to do next

If the alert action rule that was migrated had a task template, you can customize the alert management rule designer to display the task template name.

1.  In the header of the alert management rule, click **Additional actions** ![Additional actions](../../cloud-workspace/image/additional-actions.png).
2.  Select **Configure** &gt; **Form Layout**.
