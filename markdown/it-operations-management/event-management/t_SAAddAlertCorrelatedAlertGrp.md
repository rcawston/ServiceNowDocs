# Create alert group manually

Manually create an alert group to organize and manage related alerts when not using scheduled jobs. This provides flexibility to group alerts on-demand for effective resolution.

## Before you begin

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Event Management** &gt; **All Alerts**.

2.  Select the alert number to open the alert.

    The alert will be used to create an alert group, designated as the primary alert, to which you can add secondary alerts.

    **Note:** A closed alert cannot be assigned as a parent alert.

3.  Scroll down and in the **Secondary Alerts** tab, select **Add To Group**.
