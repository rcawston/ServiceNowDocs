# Connect the agent to the MID Web Server using TLS

Connect the agent to the MID Web Server to enable configuring mTLS on your MID Web Server and agent.

## Before you begin

Ensure that you have installed the .pem file and set up the MID Web Server. For details, see [Install the .pem file in the MID unified keystore and set up the MID Web Server](set-mid-web-server.md).

Role required: agent\_client\_collector\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Add the `labcacert.pem` file to your agent host's truststore.

    ```
    sudo cp -a /<path>/<to>/labcacert.pem /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/; 
    sudo update-ca-trust extract 
    openssl verify /<path>/<to>/labcacert.pem
    ```

    The generated output is `/<path>/labcacert.pem: OK`

2.  Configure the `acc.yml` file to use TLS.

    1.  Set the **insecure-skip-tls-verify** property to **false**.

    2.  Set the **backend-url** property to use the MID Server's FQDN.

        `backend-url="wss://<mid server fqdn>:<mid web server port>/ws/events"`

3.  Restart the agent.

    ```
    systemctl restart acc;
    ```

4.  Verify in the logs that the agent is connected to the MID Server.
