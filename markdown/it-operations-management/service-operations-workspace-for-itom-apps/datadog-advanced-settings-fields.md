Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Base API path

</td><td>

The specific API path for querying metrics.The default is `/api/v2/query/timeseries`.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Host API Path

</td><td>

The specific API path for retrieving the list of hosts.The default is `/api/v1/hosts`.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Host batch size

</td><td>

The number of hosts to retrieve in a single API call.The default is 500, and any value above 1000 is automatically capped at 1000.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Host filter

</td><td>

</td></tr><tr><td>

Initial sync in mins

</td><td>

Default: 15

</td></tr><tr><td>

Metric batch size

</td><td>

The number of metrics to query in a single API call.The default is 50, and any value above 50 is automatically capped at 50.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Port

</td><td>

Port number for the Datadog server to connect to.This is typically not needed when using https.

</td></tr><tr><td>
