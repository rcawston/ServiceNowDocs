# Sections and cards on the Overview tab for a Component-based alert in Health Log Analytics

The **Overview** tab in the Service Operations Workspace helps you understand Component-based alerts.

For a detailed description of Component-based alerts, see [Types of Health Log Analytics alerts](../health-log-analytics/hla-op-log-analytics-alert-types.md).

## Summary

-   **Identified issue**

    This card describes the issue that led to the alert. The identified issue appears on the card and in the title for the alert. Information about the alert appears in the banner.

    ![Identified issue appears here and in alert title.](../image/identified-issue-card-comp-based-sow.png "Identified issue")

    Select **View surrounding logs** to view log messages that are relevant to the alert. See [Analyze log lines that surround an anomaly in Health Log Analytics](../health-log-analytics/hla-op-surrounding-logs-view-sow.md).

-   **Anomaly**

    This card illustrates the anomalous activity that led to the alert.

    -   The blue line shows the recent anomalous activity.
    -   On some charts, the lightly shaded area indicates the expected \(learned baseline\) behavior.

        A peach-shaded area represents the baseline values for the same hour one day earlier. A pink-shaded area shows the values for the same period in the previous week.

    In this example, the peach-shaded area shows the data for the same hour one day earlier. The drop in the metric value \(events per minute\) is clearly visible.

    For more information on the kinds of anomalies that you might encounter, see [Types of anomalous behavior in Health Log Analytics](../health-log-analytics/hla-op-anomalous-behavior-types.md).


## Impact

-   **Configuration Items**

    This card provides information about the CIs that are impacted by the alert.

-   **Impacted services**

    This card provides information about the services that are impacted by the alert.

    ![Impact section provides information on the impacted CIs and services.](../image/hla-ovrvw-tab-impact-sow.png "Impact section")


## Cause

-   **Meaningful log properties**

    On this card, each bar chart shows the distribution of values for a single log property that contributed to the anomaly. Each property value is associated with a color. The length of a color bar correlates to the percentage that the property value holds in comparison with all other values for the property.
