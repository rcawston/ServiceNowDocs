# Information on the Overview tab for a Log Analytics alert in Health Log Analytics

The **Overview** tab in the Service Operations Workspace helps you understand Log Analytics alerts.

For a detailed description of Log Analytics alerts, see [Types of Health Log Analytics alerts](../health-log-analytics/hla-op-log-analytics-alert-types.md).

## Summary

-   **Identified issue**

    This card describes the issue that led to the alert. The identified issue appears on the card and in the title for the alert. Information about the alert appears in the banner.

    ![Identified issue appears here and in alert title.](../image/identified-issue-card-loganalytics-alert-sow.png "Identified issue")

    Select **View surrounding logs** to view the log lines that were generated one minute before and one minute after the alert. See [Analyze log lines that surround an anomaly in Health Log Analytics](../health-log-analytics/hla-op-surrounding-logs-view-sow.md).

-   **Anomaly**

    This card illustrates the anomalous activity that led to the alert.

    The chart shows:

    -   Recent anomalous activity
    -   Expected behavior \(the learned baseline\)
    -   Baseline values from one day earlier
    -   Baseline values from the previous week
    In this example, the blue line represents the current average number of events per minute. The orange-shaded area represents the baseline values for the same hour in the previous week.

    For more information on the kinds of anomalies that you might encounter, see [Types of anomalous behavior in Health Log Analytics](../health-log-analytics/hla-op-anomalous-behavior-types.md).


## Impact

-   **Configuration Items**

    This card provides information about the CIs that are impacted by the alert.

-   **Impacted services**

    This card provides information about the services that are impacted by the alert.

    ![Impact section provides information on the impacted CIs and services.](../image/hla-ovrvw-tab-impact-single-sow.png "Impact section")


## Cause

-   **Meaningful log properties**

    On this card, each bar chart shows the distribution of values for a single log property that contributed to the anomaly. Each property value is associated with a color. The length of a color bar correlates to the percentage that the property value holds in comparison with all other values for the property.
