# Upgrade issues

What to do when monitors don't work after upgrading synthetic monitoring.

## Condition

After upgrading synthetic monitoring, monitors remain in unknown state.

## Cause

After upgrading synthetic monitoring, if the monitor is hosted on a MID Server, the server must be restarted to re-recognize the hosted monitors.

## Remedy

Restart the MID Server. See [Manually start, stop, and restart a MID Server](../servicenow-platform/mid-server/t_InstallMIDServerAsWinService.md).
