# Certify an account

A certification task represents the work of verifying and certifying the data associated with a record. The certifier reviews tasks created after data validation against the published policy. Account certification helps resolve issues like outdated ownership, inactive user profiles, and improper permissions in cloud accounts.

## Before you begin

Make sure that the admin has reviewed the Cloud Account Management default policy. Optionally, the admin can customize or add new policies based on the organization requirement. For more information, see [Review default Cloud Account Management certification policy](policy-setup.md). The ITOM Cloud Account Management Certifier Group must contain at least one user.

**Note:** Cloud Account Management admin can add users to the Cloud Account Management Certifier Group by navigating to **All** &gt; **Account Certification** &gt; **ITOM CAM Certifier Group** &gt; **Group Members**.

Role required: sn\_itom\_cam.cw\_certifier

6.  Select **Submit** when all the records have been reviewed.

    The **Submit** button isn't available until all the records in the task are reviewed and the task is complete.

    **Note:**

    The account certification state changes to pending if it meets the admin's policy conditions for recertification.
