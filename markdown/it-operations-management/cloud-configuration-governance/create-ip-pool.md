# Create an IP pool

Create an IP pool to associate a cloud subnet with an IPAM provider instance.

## Before you begin

-   Role required: sn\_cmp.cloud\_admin
-   Create [Infoblox credentials](../../platform-security/connections-and-credentials/infoblox-creds.md) and [register an Infoblox server](create-infoblox.md).
-   Run Discovery on the cloud account to find subnets or [manually create cloud subnets](create-subnet.md).

**Note:** This functionality is not supported with our template-based cloud catalogs.

## Procedure

1.  In the Cloud Admin Portal, navigate to **Manage** &gt; **Networks &amp; IPAM**.

2.  On the **IP Pools** tab, click **New**, enter a unique and descriptive **Name**, and then fill in the form.

    |Mode|Select a mode based on the provider that you are creating this IP pool for. The model varies based on the provider.|
