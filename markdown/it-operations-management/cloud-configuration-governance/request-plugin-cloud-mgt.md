# Request the Cloud Provisioning and Governance application

The Cloud Provisioning and Governance application is available as a separate subscription and requires the Cloud Provisioning and Governance plugin \(com.snc.cloud.mgmt\).

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

To purchase a subscription, contact your ServiceNow account manager. The account manager can arrange to have the plugin activated on your organization's production and subproduction instances, generally within a few days.

If you don't have an account manager, decide to delay activation after purchase, or want to evaluate the product on a subproduction instance without charge, follow these steps.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  Select **Request plugin** to open the **Activate Plugin** form on Now Support.

3.  On the **Activate Plugin** form, provide the following information.

<table id="table_awx_bhf_ygb"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr id="target-instance"><td>

What is your target instance

</td><td>

Select the instance that you want to activate the plugin on.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Which plugin would you like to activate

</td><td>

Select the name of the plugin to activate.

 **Note:** If the system doesn't list the plugin you want or if you're activating the plugin on an OEM or on-premise instance, select the **Plugin I'm looking for is not listed** check box and then enter the name of the plugin.

</td></tr><tr id="date-time"><td>

Select Maintenance Date and Time

</td><td>

Select the date and time to activate the plugin.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    For example, see the following form to activate the Event Management plugin on an instance named SNC Instance.

4.  Select **Submit**.

    After the maintenance window, the system installs the plugin on your instance. To confirm the installation, go to the Installed tab in the Application Manager.
