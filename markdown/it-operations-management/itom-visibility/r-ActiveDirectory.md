# Active Directory Domain Controller discovery

The Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application uses the Active Directory Domain Controller On Windows pattern to find active directory domain controllers running on a Windows server. Discovering some of these resources may require updating to the latest version of the Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application from the ServiceNow Store.
