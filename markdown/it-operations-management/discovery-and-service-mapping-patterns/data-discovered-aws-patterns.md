# AWS discovery using patterns

Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns uses patterns to discover components of the Amazon AWS Cloud deployment during horizontal discovery. Discovering some of these resources may require updating to the latest version of the Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application from the ServiceNow Store.

## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/store-release-notes/page/release-notes/store/sn-store-release-notes.html).

## Prerequisites

-   **Verify that the applications are up to date:**
    -   Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns
    -   CMDB CI Class Models
    -   Visibility Content
-   **Update the method used for pointed discovery for the AWS CloudFormation Template \(CFT\) stack**

    If you use Cloud Provisioning and Governance, you must update the **getOperationGR\(type\)** method. This update enables the pointed discovery to list the resources correctly for the AWS CFT stack after provisioning. For further information about the steps required to update this method, see the Knowledge Base article [KB0858437](https://support.servicenow.com/nav_to.do?uri=kb_knowledge.do?sys_id=54ecb719db1f1cd0fb115583ca961917).

-   **Activate the cloud-related CI relationships**

    To include discovered components into service instances, enable CI relationships used in tag-based discovery by Service Mapping. These CI relationships are available from the 1.0.68 release on the ServiceNow Store. For operational steps, see [Tag-based discovery configuration](../service-mapping/tag_discovery_configuration.md).

-   **Set up service accounts on the AWS Management Console**

    An AWS Organization is a collection of AWS accounts under a single account. In AWS Organizations, parent accounts are called management accounts. The sub-accounts that belong to a management account are called member accounts.

    **Note:** Cloud Discovery for AWS Organizations isn’t fully supported in a [GovCloud](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/whatis.html) isolated region.

    The advantages of using management accounts in Discovery are:

    -   **Easy population of member accounts**

        After you configure the management account and supply the necessary credentials, you can test the connection to the account. If the test succeeds, Discovery returns a list of the member accounts in that management account. From this list, you can choose one or more member to include in the Discovery of the management account.

    -   **\(Optional\) Discover member resources using dynamically acquired credentials**

        When you run Discovery on your cloud resources, you don’t need separate credentials for each member account. The Cloud Discovery process handles credentials automatically by acquiring a temporary credential for each member via an AWS API. You can elect to use the default configuration or customize the MID Server to assume other roles for additional controls and security.

    For more information, see [Setting up AWS service accounts](../setup-aws-service-accounts.md).

-   **Use IAM user policy on the AWS Management Console**

    To use the IAM user policy instead of credentials during discovery, configure the MID Server for AWS IAM roles. For more information, see [configure the MID Server for AWS IAM roles](../config-mid-iam-roles.md).

    To create the IAM user policy for provisioning AWS resources, see [Control AWS access and permissions using policies](../aws-create-user-policy-cloud-mgt.md). Ensure that the IAM user policy covers the following AWS resources:

    ```
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Action": [
            "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeLoadBalancerPolicyTypes",
            "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeLoadBalancers",
            "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeLoadBalancerPolicies",
            "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeInstanceHealth",
            "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeTags",
            "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeLoadBalancerAttributes",
            "account:ListRegions",
            "elasticloadbalancing:Describe*",
            "ec2:Describe*",
            "ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaceAttribute",
            "ec2:DescribeInstanceStatus",
            "ec2:DescribeCustomerGateways",
            "ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups",
            "ec2:DescribeHosts",
            "ec2:DescribeImages",
            "ec2:DescribeVpcs",
            "ec2:DescribeAccountAttributes",
            "ec2:DescribeInstanceAttribute",
            "ec2:DescribeInstanceCreditSpecifications",
           
                ],
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Resource": "*"
            }
        ]
    }
    
    ```

-   **Configure access to the AWS resources**

    To discover a single account, create an IAM account in the AWS Management Console, and ensure that it has the "ReadOnlyAccess" policy applied. To discover several member or child accounts, configure the credentials as described in [Access setup for AWS service accounts](../access-aws-accounts.md).

-   **Configure a discovery schedule**

    [Create an AWS Discovery schedule in Discovery Admin Workspace](../discovery/create-AWS-schedule-DAW.md).

-   **\(Optional\) Discover datacenters only for new members**

    Starting with Zurich Patch 2, you can discover datacenters only for new members added since the last discovery. For more information, see [Discover datacenters only for new cloud accounts](discover-datacenter-only-new-account.md).

-   **Optimize discovery by including only datacenters with resources**

    Starting with Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns version 1.29.0, you can optimize discovery by limiting it to only AWS datacenters with resources.

    -   Verify your service account has the following role permissions to access Config API:
        -   `config:GetDiscoveredResourceCounts`
        -   `config:DescribeConfigurationRecorderStatus`
    -   Verify AWS Config recorder is enabled and configured to record the all resource types.

        For instructions on configuring AWS Config recorder, go to the [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/) and search for the "Recording resources in the AWS Config console" article.

    -   Enable discovery of only datacenters with resources by setting the **mid.cloud.discovery.sonar.discover\_all\_aws\_datacenters** MID Server property to **false**. For more information, see [Limit AWS discovery to datacenters with resources](limit-aws-discovery-active-datacenter.md).
    For more information, see the **AWS resources discovery by datacenters** section.

-   **\(Optional\) Populate Service Account and Logical Datacenter fields in cloud CIs**

    Starting with Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns version 1.30.2, you can improve query performance by populating Service Account and Logical Datacenter fields directly in cloud CIs. For more information, see [Improved query performance with direct field population in CI tables](query-service-account-ldc-fields.md).


## Verify the REST API Permissions

Download the [Cloud Discovery patterns spreadsheet](https://downloads.docs.servicenow.com/resource/enus/api/servicenow-discovery-patterns-api-details.xlsx) so you can grant user permissions required for running the Discovery patterns. In addition to permissions, the spreadsheet also includes useful information such as pattern names, types, CI Classes, and links to vendor documentation. New patterns are available quarterly, so check periodically to be sure you have the latest version of the spreadsheet.

**Note:** You can test the AWS REST APIs using Postman API platform. For more information, see the [How to test AWS REST API using POSTMAN \[KB0782183\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0782183) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

## Support for AWS services in the China region

The latest version of Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns supports discovering AWS services in the China region. You can discover these services on the ServiceNow AI Platform, starting from Xanadu Patch 3 and Washington DC Patch 9 instances.

Discovering AWS services in the China region requires using a datacenter URL when setting up an AWS service account. For example: `https://organizations.cn-northwest-1.amazonaws.com.cn`.

-   To learn more about AWS master account and sub-account support in the China region, see [KB1704526](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1704526).
-   To identify AWS patterns supported in the China region, refer to the Cloud Discovery patterns spreadsheet. The **AWS China Region Support** column has a Yes value for supported patterns.

## AWS resources discovery by datacenters

Starting with version 1.29.0, Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns introduces a new AWS datacenter discovery model. The previous model discovered all datacenters, regardless of whether they contained relevant resources. The new model improves the AWS discovery performance by focusing on only datacenters that contain resources.

AWS has multiple datacenters around the world, but resources like load balancers and virtual machines are typically deployed in only some of them. The **Amazon AWS Datacenter Discovery** pattern runs before all other AWS patterns to identify datacenters with resources related to your service account \("active"\) and those without \("passive"\). A datacenter can also be classified as "empty" due to API call errors, AWS Config service not being enabled, or permission issues. You can check the discovery log for the exact cause of the error. For more information, see [Logs for horizontal discovery](../discovery/r_DiscoveryLog.md#).

After identifying "active", "passive", or "empty" datacenters, the discovery schedule continues to execute all AWS patterns only for "active" or "empty" datacenters, to discover your AWS cloud resources. "Passive" datacenters are ignored during the schedule. The **Refresh Datacenters** flow continues to display all regions, not just active ones. You don’t need to create another schedule when a resource is added or a datacenter switches from passive to active.

You might notice differences in the AWS discovery log, in discovery time and in the CMDB, depending on the service account and MID Server property settings.

Datacenters that have already been discovered before upgrading to Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns version 1.29.0 remain in the **Amazon AWS Datacenters** table. The **mid.cloud.discovery.sonar.discover\_all\_aws\_datacenters** MID Server property is set to **true** by default, which discovers all datacenters. To limit discovery to the "active" or "empty" datacenters, set this property to **false**. For information on setting up active datacenter discovery, see the **\(optional\) Optimize discovery by including only datacenters with resources** prerequisite.

|MID Server property setting|Flow|Discovered/displayed datacenters|
|---------------------------|----|--------------------------------|
|False|New schedule|All datacenters except passive|
|False|Refresh Datacenters|All datacenters|
|True \(default\)|New schedule|All datacenters|
|True \(default\)|Refresh Datacenters|All datacenters|

## Events discovered by Discovery during horizontal discovery

Discovery uses patterns to find events created for Amazon AWS Cloud components. If there are events that indicate the change of state in one of the Amazon AWS Cloud components, it triggers discovery of Amazon AWS Cloud components using the patterns.

|Pattern|CI|
|-------|---|
|Amazon AWS Virtual Server Events|Virtual Machine Instance \[cmdb\_ci\_vm\_instance\]|
|Amazon AWS Security Group Events|Compute Security Group \[cmdb\_ci\_compute\_security\_group\]|
