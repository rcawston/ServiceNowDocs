# Fortinet firewall and FortiGate VDOM REST-based discovery

The Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application uses the Next Generation Fortinet Network Firewall - REST pattern to find Fortinet firewalls through REST API calls. Additionally, the pattern extension VDOM Discovery finds FortiGate Virtual Domains \(VDOMs\). Discovering some of these resources may require updating to the latest version of the Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application from the ServiceNow Store.

The Next Generation Fortinet Network Firewall - REST pattern uses a set of REST API calls to find the Fortinet firewalls. For FortiGate VDOM discovery, only multi-VDOM mode is supported.

**Note:** Only the REST-based Fortinet firewall discovery method finds FortiGate VDOMs. The SNMP-based Fortinet firewall discovery method doesn't discover them. For information about the default SNMP-based Fortinet firewall discovery, see [Next-Generation Fortinet Network Firewall SNMP-based discovery](fortinet-fw-discovery.md).

## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/store-release-notes/page/release-notes/store/sn-store-release-notes.html).

To learn about Fortinet Firewalls and their versions that you can discover, refer to [Detailed information on products discovered by ITOM Visibility](../itom-visibility/r_SupportedApplications.md).

## Prerequisites

-   **Verify that the applications are up to date**
    -   Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns
    -   CMDB CI Class Models
-   **Create API Token**

    Create an API Token in Fortinet. For instructions on creating an API Token, go to the [Fortinet Document Library](https://docs.fortinet.com/) and search for the "Connect FortiGate device via API Token - Online Help" article under the FortiConverter Tool product family.

-   **Verify API access and permissions**

    -   Verify that the MID Server can access the Fortinet APIs.
    -   Verify that the API Token has sufficient permissions to retrieve the required information from the Fortinet devices.
    Required Fortinet APIs:

    -   `v2/cmdb/system/global`
    -   `api/v2/monitor/system/status`
    -   `api/v2/cmdb/system/ha`
    -   `api/v2/cmdb/router/static`
    -   `/api/v2/cmdb/firewall/policy`
    -   `api/v2/cmdb/system/vdom-property`
    -   `api/v2/cmdb/system/interface`
    -   `/api/v2/monitor/system/interface/select`
-   **Disable SNMP-based Fortinet firewall discovery**

    For more information, see [Disable SNMP-based Fortinet firewall discovery](disable-snmp-fortinet-fw-discovery.md).

-   **Create an alias for the API Key Credentials**

    For more information, see [Create an alias for the API key credential for Fortinet firewall REST-based discovery](create-alias-api-key-cred-fortinet.md).

-   **Create a serverless discovery schedule**

    For more information, see [Create a serverless schedule for Fortinet firewall REST-based discovery](create-serverless-schedule-fortinet.md).
