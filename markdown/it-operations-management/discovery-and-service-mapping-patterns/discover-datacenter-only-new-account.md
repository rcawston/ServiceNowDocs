# Discover datacenters only for new cloud accounts

If you have multiple cloud accounts and datacenters in AWS and Azure, you can discover datacenters for new cloud accounts only, instead of refreshing the entire list.

## Before you begin

-   Verify that you're using at least Zurich Patch 2.
-   Verify that the **glide.discovery.cdu.auto\_refresh\_sub\_accounts\_and\_ldcs** system property is set to true. For more information, see [Create Discovery schedules for cloud resources](../discovery/discovery-manager.md#).

Role required: discovery\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Properties** &gt; **All Properties**.

2.  In the **Name** column, search for `cloud.discovery.refresh_datacenter_for_new_member_account`.

3.  Select the **cloud.discovery.refresh\_datacenter\_for\_new\_member\_account** property.

4.  In the **Value** field, enter **true**.

5.  Select **Update**.


## What to do next

Either execute discovery immediately or wait until the predefined schedule triggers the discovery. For more information, see [Create a discovery schedule in Cloud Discovery Workspace](../discovery/cloud-operations-disco-create-schedule.md).
