# Limit AWS discovery to datacenters with resources

Optimize AWS discovery by limiting it to datacenters with resources.

## Before you begin

Verify that you have installed Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns, starting with version 1.29.0.

Role required: discovery\_admin

## About this task

Starting with version 1.29.0, Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns introduces a new AWS datacenter discovery model that focuses discovery on datacenters with resources and excludes datacenters that don't contain resource. To limit discovery to datacenters that contain resources, set the **mid.cloud.discovery.sonar.discover\_all\_aws\_datacenters** MID Server property to false. For more information, see [AWS discovery using patterns](data-discovered-aws-patterns.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **MID Server** &gt; **Properties**.

2.  In the **Name** column, search for the `mid.cloud.discovery.sonar.discover_all_aws_datacenters` property.

3.  Select the **mid.cloud.discovery.sonar.discover\_all\_aws\_datacenters** property.

4.  In the **Value** field, enter `false`.

5.  Select **Update**.
