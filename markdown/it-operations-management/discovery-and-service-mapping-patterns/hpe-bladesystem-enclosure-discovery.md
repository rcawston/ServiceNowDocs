# HPE BladeSystem Enclosure Discovery

ServiceNow Discovery uses the HPE BladeSystem Enclosure discovery pattern to discover BladeSystem, which is a line of Hewlett Packard Enterprise blade server machines. Discovering some of these resources may require updating to the latest version of the Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application from the ServiceNow Store.

## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/store-release-notes/page/release-notes/store/sn-store-release-notes.html).

## Prerequisites

-   Ensure you are using the latest version of Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns.
-   Set SNMP credentials for the enclosure \(to be used by the Classifier\). For more information, see [SNMP credentials](../../platform-security/connections-and-credentials/c_SNMPCredentials.md).
-   Set the SSH credentials for the enclosure’s Onboard Administrator \(to be used by the Discovery pattern\). The account used for accessing the Onboard Administrator must have permissions to view all of the enclosure’s bays, so it can gather the blade servers' information. For more information, see [SSH credentials](../../platform-security/connections-and-credentials/r_SSHCredentialsForm.md).
-   Verify the Onboard Administrator’s IP address, which Discovery runs against.
-   Ensure that the host machine is reachable from the MID Server.

## Highlights and supported versions

The pattern has been tested against:

-   HPE BladeSystem c7000 Enclosure G2 and G3
-   HPE BladeSystem blades: HPE ProLiant BL460c
    -   Generations 8, 9 and 10
    -   ROM Versions: I31, I36, I41 \(2014-2021\)
    -   Blades being managed by a Virtual Connect Manager/Virtual Connect Enterprise Manager \(VCM/VCEM\) have a logical serial number. In this case, the serial number, which is exposed by WMI, for example, is the logical one, rather than the physical one, as is usually the case. When creating the relation between the blade and the OS server, based on the serial number, the system attempts to match both the physical and logical serial numbers with the ones owned by the OS Server.
    -   When discovering blade servers with the logical serial numbers, their logical serial numbers are inserted to **cmdb\_serial\_number** with the **logical** type. This is a new serial number type that was created to support these new serial numbers introduced by HP.

        **Note:** The WMI provides the logical serial number as the bios serial number. ESXi servers are discovered by probes. The ESXiserver CI gets the logical serial number as **chassis**.
