# Rubrik Cluster discovery

Discovery uses multiple patterns to find all Rubrik cluster data. Discovering these resources requires installing the Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns and the CMDB CI Class Models applications from the ServiceNow Store, as each application is dependent on the other.

You can use the patterns for discovering the Rubrik components on the ServiceNow AI Platform using the Paris release or later.

**Note:** The update applied in version 1.0.78 of the Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application resolves an issue of duplicate CI types in the CMDB. If you are using Rubrik discovery patterns and already installed versions 1.21.0, 1.23.0, 1.24.0 or 1.25.0 of the CMDB CI Class Models store app \(sn\_cmdb\_ci\_class\), or versions 1.0.73, 1.0.74, 1.0.75 or 1.0.76 of the Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application \(sn\_itom\_pattern\), you should follow the instructions in [KB0957523](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0957523).

All of the information for the main CI \(Rubrik Cluster\) and its corresponding CI types is returned by​ REST API calls.

Take note of the following limitations:

-   Reference fields are not supported due to the Large Payload mechanism limitations in the Paris and Quebec releases.
-   All the entities returned from the Rubrik REST API for Hosts \(Servers\) with IP addresses not resolved to hostnames are filtered out \(excluded\) from the Rubrik discovery. This is done to prevent the creation of duplicates across the CMDB.

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/store-release-notes/page/release-notes/store/sn-store-release-notes.html).

## Prerequisites

-   **Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns store app**

    Deploy the 1.0.73 release or later from the ServiceNow Store.

-   **CMDB CI Class Models store app**

    Deploy the 1.21.0 release or later from the ServiceNow Store.

-   **Basic Auth permissions**

    Ensure Basic Auth credentials are configured for authenticating the REST API calls.

    Credential aliases associated with the Rubrik credentials of type Basic Auth must also be created. These aliases serve as input parameters, along with the IP address.

    These are used for discovery of all the CI types associated with the Rubrik cluster.

    -   Security Scheme Type: HTTP
    -   HTTP Authorization Scheme: basic
-   **MID server**

    Ensure that the MID server can access the target appliance device.

-   **Create a serverless discovery schedule**

    Create a serverless discovery schedule to perform targeted discovery of Rubrik cluster resources.

    **Note:** The Discovery schedule that triggers all the Rubrik related patterns supports only the serverless discovery type. In addition, for each different Rubrik cluster \(Brik\), a different serverless discovery schedule should be created. The schedule should include the IP address of any of the Rubrik nodes associated with the Rubrik cluster, and the credential alias associated with the Rubrik Basic Authentication credential record.

    1.  Navigate to **Discovery** &gt; **Discovery Schedules**.
    2.  Click **New** and then fill in the form.

<table id="table_ut3_sby_hhb"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

Name for the Discovery schedule. For example, `Discover Rubrik`.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Discover

</td><td>

Discover type. Select **Serverless**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Name of the MID Server.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    3.  Right-click the header of the Discovery Schedule form and select **Save**.
    4.  Navigate to **Connections &amp; Credential Aliases** and create a new Credential record type. In the Credentials related list form, create a new Basic Auth credential record type.

        ![Rubrik credentials](../image/Rubrik-credentials.png)

        **Note:** The credential alias can be associated with existing credentials. When creating a credential record you can also associate to it the credential alias. Click the **Credential alias** padlock icon in the Connections &amp; Credential Aliases record type you created above, and associate as required.

        ![Rubrik credentials](../image/Rubrik-credentials-alias.png)

    5.  Click the **Serverless Execution Patterns** tab.

        ![Rubrik serverless discovery](../image/Rubrik-serverless.jpg)

    6.  Ensure the Run Child Patterns column for the Rubrik discovery pattern is set to **true**. This triggers all the child patterns associated with the Rubrik discovery pattern. This is needed due to the Large Payload \(LP\) mechanism, used for discovery of the Rubrik cluster and all corresponding CI types.
    7.  Under **Discovery Pattern Launcher Parameters**, set the **credential\_alias** and **ip\_address** parameters, which serve as input parameters for triggering the Discovery schedule and the associated Rubrik discovery pattern.

        Set the **ip\_address** with one of the IP addresses of any of the Rubrik nodes associated with the Rubrik cluster. Set the **credential\_alias** with the ID of the Credential record type created in **Connections &amp; Credential Aliases**, which is related with the Rubrik credential Basic Auth record type.

-   **Resources discovered by the Rubrik Hyper-V Instance \(LP\) pattern**

    **Note:** Discovery of Hyper-V instances only updates existing CIs. This is due to a limitation in the Rubrik REST API not returning the GUID \(object\_id\) of the Hyper-V instance. If there is no match between the data from the REST API and the CMDB, no CIs are updated. In addition, when there is no match, the Rubrik Hyper-V Instance \(LP\) pattern completes in an ‘Error’ state, which is expected behavior.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Rubrik Hyper-V Instance \[cmdb\_ci\_hyper\_v\_instance\]|
    |name|The name of the Hyper-V instance.​|

-   **Resources discovered by the Rubrik VMware Instance \(LP\) pattern**

    **Note:** Discovery of VMware instances only updates existing CIs. This is because the regular vCenter discovery does not use the IRE \(Identification and Reconciliation Engine\) and the Rubrik VMware pattern will create duplicates. If there is no match between the data from the REST API and the CMDB, no CIs are updated. In addition, when there is no match, the Rubrik VMware Instance \(LP\) pattern completes in an ‘Error’ state, which is expected behavior.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Rubrik VMware Instance \[cmdb\_ci\_vmware\_instance\]|
