# NetApp SolidFire storage system discovery

ServiceNow Discovery uses the NetApp SolidFire storage system discovery pattern to find clusters and nodes on the SolidFire storage system. Discovering some of these resources may require updating to the latest version of the Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application from the ServiceNow Store.

## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/store-release-notes/page/release-notes/store/sn-store-release-notes.html).

## Prerequisites

-   **Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns store app**

    Verify the Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns store app \(version 1.0.74\) is installed.

-   **Basic Auth permissions**

    Ensure Basic Auth credentials are configured for authenticating the Element API calls. Save the following SolidFire Cluster Admin credentials as Basic Auth credentials to ensure proper access:

    -   read
    -   clusterAdmins
    -   reporting
    -   drives
-   **MID server**

    Ensure the MID server can access the target device.

-   **Discovery credentials**

    Ensure you have the credentials for running Discovery on the host machine running the SolidFire storage system​.

-   **Create a serverless discovery schedule**

    Create a discovery schedule to perform targeted discovery of SolidFire clusters and nodes.

    1.  Navigate to **Discovery** &gt; **Discovery Schedules**.
    2.  Click **New** and then fill in the form.

<table id="table_tt1_3z5_54b"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

Name for the Discovery schedule. For example, `Discover SolidFire`.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Discover

</td><td>

Discover type. Select **Serverless**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

MID Server

</td><td>

Name of the MID Server.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Option for enabling this schedule for discovery. Select this check box to enable discovery.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    3.  Right-click the header of the Discovery Schedule form and select **Save**.
    4.  Click the **Serverless Execution Patterns** tab, click **New**, and then fill in the form.

        |Field|Description|
        |-----|-----------|
        |Name|Name for this Serverless Execution Pattern. For example, `SolidFire Storage Pattern`.|
        |Pattern|Name of the pattern to run: NetApp SolidFire Storage System.|
        |Proxy Host|Fully qualified domain name of the machine on which you are installing the proxy server. Specify **Global**.|
        |Active|Option for enabling this schedule for discovery. Select this check box to enable discovery.|

    5.  Under **Discovery Pattern Launcher Parameters**, configure the launch parameters with the relevant values. Ensure the Management IP of the cluster and Credentials Alias are defined.
