# Create process configuration using Process Configuration Builder

Process configuration helps you configure preferences for a process table. This configuration assists you when creating projects using the configured table. It streamlines the project creation process by providing a ready-made framework tailored to your organization's needs. Importantly, completing the process configuration allows you to independently create projects, even if you do not have prior experience with process mining.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_process\_mining\_power\_user or sn\_process\_mining\_admin

**Important:** Process configuration is not available for Agentic AI data.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Process Mining Workspace**.

2.  On the left of the page, select the Process configurations icon \(![Process configuration builder](../image/icon-process-config.png)\).

    The page displays the following information:

    -   ![Label for section A](../image/icon-a.png): Process configurations icon
    -   ![Label for section B](../image/icon-b.png): Process configurations help icon
    -   ![Label for section C](../image/icon-c.png): Read-only process configuration templates from content pack applications
    -   ![Label for section D](../image/icon-d.png): List of tables for which the configuration is created
    -   ![Label for section E](../image/icon-e.png): Button that enables you to create a new configuration
    -   ![Label for section F](../image/icon-f.png): Information displayed after selecting the information icon \(![Label for section B](../image/icon-b.png)\)
3.  Select **Create New**.

    The New process configuration dialog box is displayed.

    If a content pack application is installed for a process, the following dialog box is displayed.

4.  Select a table.

5.  Select the **Start with pre-built content pack template** option if you want to use the content pack template.

    **Note:** This option is available only if a content pack application is installed for a process.

    For more information about process configurations using content packs, see [Create process configurations using content packs](process-config-content-pack.md).

6.  Select **Get started**.

    **Important:**

    Only one process configuration is allowed per table. Before creating a process configuration for a table, ensure that process configuration isn’t yet created for that table. If a configuration is available for the table, use the configuration. You can edit the configuration by opening the table from the **Configurations** list.

    The **Process details** page is displayed.
