# Working with external datasets

Use the data available outside of ServiceNow® environment in Process Mining to optimize your processes and solve business problems. To use external datasets, you must first import them into ServiceNow® environment.

**Note:** For Process Mining for External Data subscription, please contact your account team. You can request for the purchase of this feature from ServiceNow® Store.For more information, see [Request Process Mining for external data](access-ext-data.md).

Importing external datasets into ServiceNow® environment lets you use Process Mining on any data without thinking about its source, thus making your life easy.

To import external datasets into ServiceNow® and create a project with it and mine it, you must do the following steps:

-   [Create an audit table](create-table.md)
-   [Import external data into the audit table](import-data.md)
-   [Validate the imported data](verify-data.md)
-   [Create a records table](create-case-record.md)
-   [Create a project and mine it](create-project.md)

-   **[Create an audit table](create-table.md)**  
Create an audit table to store data. Audit table is a staging table that is created with the required columns to populate the external data.
-   **[Add custom fields to the audit table](add-custom-field.md)**  
The custom fields form as breakdown filters when viewing the process graph. Without custom fields, there won't be any breakdown filters.
-   **[Import data into the audit table](import-data.md)**  
Import external dataset into the audit table to start working with the data in Process Mining.
-   **[Verify the imported data](verify-data.md)**  
Verify the data that was imported and validate that the data is accurate. The success of your data mining depends on the accuracy of your imported data.
-   **[Create case records for the imported data](create-case-record.md)**  
Create case records for the imported data as it is important for creating a project and mining it. Without a record table, a project can’t be created.
-   **[Create a project](create-project.md)**  
Create a project with the imported external data. You must mine the project to analyze your data and improve your processes.
-   **[Managing an audit table](managing-audit-table.md#)**  
After the audit and record tables are created with the imported data, you can use them to create a project. You can also share, edit, empty, or delete the tables.
