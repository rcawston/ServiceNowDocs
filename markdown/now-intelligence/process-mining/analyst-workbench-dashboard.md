# Analyst workbench page

View the visualized process map with tools for managing visualizations and performing analysis tasks from a project's page.

## Access the Analyst workbench

From Analyst workbench, you can access visualized process workflow data and tools for analyzing the data.

To access Analyst workbench:

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Process Mining Workspace**.
2.  Open a project, and navigate to Analyst workbench.

## Breakdowns

<table id="table_txt_ckt_21c"><tbody><tr><td>

Use the **Breakdowns** tab to create and delete filter sets, and set advanced filter conditions.

 **Note:** You can apply breakdown filters on parent and child tables.

</td><td>

</td></tr><tr><td>

Use the Filter breakdowns icon \(![Filter breakdown](../image/filter.png)\) to filter your breakdowns based on criteria you select in the filters.

</td><td>

</td></tr><tr><td>

Use the **Process steps** button to define advanced filters on your transitions. For details on this process, see [Create a process step filter manually](create-transition-manually.md).You can filter the parent and the child tables in the multidimensional projects.

</td><td>

</td></tr><tr><td>

You can also view the number of touchpoint records from the **Breakdowns** tab by selecting the columns.

</table>## Variation analysis

<table id="table_ebf_glt_21c"><tbody><tr><td>

Use the **Variants** tab to view the routes taken by your records, the number of cases, average duration, and number of steps involved in each route. Select a route to highlight the route in the process map.

</td><td>

</table>## Process map

<table id="table_hnq_llt_21c"><tbody><tr><td>

Use the **Process map** to view a visualized map of your project. Within the map, you can drill down into your business process to better understand and optimize them. The process map also displays routes according to the KPIs you want to view or measure.

</td><td>

</td></tr><tr><td>

Select a node or transition line within the map to view additional details about the selected item in a modal window.

 These windows contain bar chart histograms displaying additional information.

-   Select a node to view distribution or repetition information.
-   Select a transition line to view duration or repetition information.

 Select a bar, and select **Apply as filter** to filter by these results.

 For more information on using this tool, [Refining a process map](analyze-data.md).

 When you select a node, the modal window displays the outgoing and incoming distribution of records via the selected node.

 This information is displayed in the **Transitions** section.

</td><td>

![Details of a node or transition line](../image/node-details-analystwb.png)

</td></tr><tr><td>

When you select a transition line, the modal window displays the occurrences, repetitions, and duration for the transition.

 From the **Investigate** drop-down, you can also view the relevant records, work notes analysis, run cluster analysis, root cause analysis, or apply a transition. These tasks are run using scheduled tasks that run in the background.

 For information on each analysis, see the following topics:

-   [Cluster analysis](cluster-analysis.md)
-   [Work notes analysis](worknotes-analysis.md)
-   [Automated root cause analysis](auto-rca.md)

Select a node or transition, and from the dialog box, select **Filter on Process step** in the **Investigate** section.You can edit the process step and apply it. This task runs using the scheduled tasks that run in the background. After the task completes, you can view the result.

</td><td>

</td></tr><tr><td>

Select a node, and from the dialog box, select **Outgoing** or **Incoming** from the **Transitions** section.Now, go to the Investigate section, and select **Filter on process steps**.

The filter is created with the preference you chose in the **Transitions** section. Select **Apply**.

This task runs using the scheduled tasks that run in the background. After the task completes, you can view the result.

</td></tr><tr><td>

You can apply multiple activity definitions in one view. Select multiple activity definitions from the Views area, and select **Apply view**.

</td><td>

</td></tr><tr><td>

You can chose to hide only incoming arcs, only outgoing arcs, or both.

 From **Modal Options**, select **Hide incoming connections**, **Hide outgoing connections**, or both to view the connections as per your need.

 **Note:** This option is available only for multi-table projects.

</td><td>

</td></tr><tr><td>

You can view the number of touchpoints for the project from the process map.Select a transition and view the details to know how many touchpoints took place between the selected steps.

Select a node and view the details to know how many touchpoints took place until the record moves to any next step. You can view the histogram distribution of touchpoints on the node.

You can also set a touchpoint from the histogram as a filter. Select a node. On the details window, select **Touchpoints** from the **Metrics** list of the **Records distribution** section. Now, select a touchpoint from the histogram, and select **Set as filter**.

This task runs in the background using scheduled tasks. Yo can view the data on this filter after the task is complete.

</td></tr><tr><td>

You can view the number of idle time cases for the project from the process map.From the model options, filter the view by a team \(for example, Assignment group\). Select a node, and view the details to know the total idle time cases. You can view the histogram distribution of idle time on the node.

Create a Task Mining project.Select a node, then select the **Create project** button in the Task Mining section.

For information on creating a Task Mining project, see [Create Task Mining project](create-task-mining-project.md).

You can access the associated Task Mining projects from the right panel using the icon \(![Task Mining icon](../image/icon-asso-proj.png)\).
