# Tree view navigation

To navigate the admin console tree view effectively, it's good to know what the various icons and other visual data in the tree view indicate.

**Important:** Dependency Assessment does not support Platform Analytics artifacts. It analyzes information only for Core UI Performance Analytics widgets but not Platform Analytics data visualizations. Also, you can launch Dependency Assessment from a Core UI responsive dashboard but not from a Platform Analytics dashboard.

## Moving through the tree view

You can click and drag the tree view to show nodes that are outside of the screen. You can also use Ctrl+A and then use the arrow keys to move the tree view around. Use Tab to return to the first node in the tree.

## Node types

The node types reflect the different features of Performance Analytics. When you click a node, it expands into its child features on the next level of the tree view.

-   **Dashboard-related nodes**

    Dashboards group nodes expand into dashboards. Dashboards expand into dashboard tabs even if the dashboard has only one tab. Dashboard tabs expand into the contents of the tab.

-   **Widgets**

    Widgets open nodes that show their component parts.

-   **Indicators**

    All indicator nodes open into nodes for their component sources, breakdowns, jobs, and scripts. Indicator nodes include automated, formula, widget, manual, external and supporting indicators.

-   **Reports**

    Reports open nodes that show their component tables.

-   **Breakdowns**

    Breakdowns open nodes that show their sources.

-   **Sources**

    All source nodes \(breakdown, indicator, and report sources\) open nodes that show their source tables.


When you click a text widget, the underlying file appears as a pop-up over the tree view. Choices from a context menu appear in a pop-up as well.
