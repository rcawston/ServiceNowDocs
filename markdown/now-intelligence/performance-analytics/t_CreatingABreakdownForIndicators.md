# Create an automated breakdown

To create an automated breakdown, select a breakdown source for it to use and apply access restrictions. Then map which field on the indicator source references the breakdown source. Finally, assign indicators to the breakdown.

## Before you begin

Familiarize yourself with the definitions and uses of [breakdowns in general](c_CreatingBreakdowns.md) and [automated breakdowns](automated-breakdowns.md) in particular.

Role required: pa\_data\_collector, pa\_power\_user, pa\_admin, or admin

## About this task

An automated breakdown uses a breakdown source to determine selectable elements. You can use an existing breakdown source or you can define a new one.

**Note:** This process allows you to create a fully customized breakdown. To create a simple automated breakdown, see [Create a breakdown from a wizard](t_CreateBreakdownFromWizard.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Performance Analytics** &gt; **Automated Breakdowns** and click **New**.

2.  Specify a meaningful **Name**.

    The name of a breakdown is frequently based on the label of the field that is used in the breakdown mappings.

3.  In the **Automated** tab, select the **Breakdown source**.

4.  Select a **Default elements filter**.

    Use element filters to restrict the elements that are visible to a user. For more information, see [Element filters](c_BreakdownElementFilters.md#).

5.  In the **Access control** tab, set who can see the breakdown.

    These restrictions apply in all cases: seeing the breakdown in the list of breakdowns, seeing the breakdown in an Analytics Hub or dashboard, or using the breakdown when creating a widget.

    |Value of Visible to|Further settings|
    |-------------------|----------------|
    |**Everyone \(default\)**|You can restrict visibility by roles. Unselect **Visible by all roles** and select the **Roles** that are required to access the breakdown.|
    |**Groups and Users**|Select the **Groups** and individual **Users** who can access this breakdown. You can select groups or users from a list, and you can select users by email address.|


## What to do next

Create breakdown mappings and associate indicators with the breakdown. You can do this from the indicator, using a graphical tool \(see [Assign and map breakdowns](create-breakdown-mapping.md#).
