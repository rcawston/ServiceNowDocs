# Edit a responsive dashboard

You can edit the contents of a dashboard, including Performance Analytics widgets, reports, and tabs. Because dashboards are shared, any modifications you make are applied globally.

## Before you begin

**Note:** This topic refers to Dashboards in the Core UI. If your instance is migrated to Platform Analytics experience, see [Edit Platform Analytics dashboards](../edit-db-in-ac.md).

Owners of Core UI responsive dashboards have the option to migrate these dashboards to Platform Analytics experience. For more information, see [Migrate dashboards that you own](../data-migration-migrate-dbs-you-own.md).

If Platform Analytics experience is enabled, the dashboard picker shows both Core UI and Platform Analytics experience dashboards.

Core UI dashboard backgrounds are not themeable with custom colors.

Role required: The dashboard\_admin role is required to create or edit Core UI Responsive Dashboards, which may still be necessary in Service Portal, for example. See [Dashboard permissions](c_DashboardRoles.md) for more information about viewing and editing rights on dashboards.

**Note:** Responsive dashboards do not support the Sticky Notes widget.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Self-Service** &gt; **Dashboards** or **All** &gt; **Performance Analytics** &gt; **Dashboards**.

2.  From the dashboard picker, select the dashboard that you want to edit.

3.  Perform any of the following actions.

<table id="choicetable_gv3_q3r_g5"><thead><tr><th align="left" id="d230692e213">

**Add a widget**

</td><td>

1.  Click the plus sign \(![Plus sign button](../image/AddWidgetButton.png)\) to put the dashboard in edit mode.

3.  Select the widget. A preview of the widget appears.
4.  Click **Add**. The widget appears at the top of the dashboard.
5.  Drag to move the widget or resize it.
 **Note:** Data visualization titles are not automatically translated on localized ServiceNow instances.

 The widget opens in the tool where it was created. For example, when you edit a report widget, the source report opens in the Report Designer.
