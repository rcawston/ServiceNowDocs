# Edit in-line Platform Analytics dashboard elements

You can edit the contents of a dashboard or dashboard tab, including data visualizations and filters. Because dashboards are shared, any changes you make are applied globally.

## Before you begin

Role required: dashboard\_admin for all dashboards, or any role for dashboards that you own or ones that you have been given the right to edit. See [Platform Analytics dashboard roles](pa-dashboard-roles.md) for more information about viewing and editing rights on dashboards.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Platform Analytics** &gt; **Library** &gt; **Dashboards**.

2.  Open the dashboard that you want to edit.

3.  Select **Edit** to put the dashboard into edit mode.

4.  If you are in a different application scope than the dashboard, use the application picker to select the correct scope.

    ![Application scope picker](../../par-for-workspace/image/app-scope-picker.png)

5.  Focus on the element you want to edit.

    A menu appears in the element header. The selection of actions to take depends on your roles.

    ![Menu in header of filter with actions available to admin.](../../par-for-workspace/image/db-element-menu-admin.png "Actions menu of filter for admin user, multi-tab dashboard")

6.  Perform any of the following actions on the element.

**Configure an element**

</td><td>

Focus on the element and select **Configure**. The configuration panel opens.Configuration options depend on the element type. For data visualizations and filters, they also depend on the visualization or filter type, respectively. For more information, see [Creating data visualizations](creating-data-visualizations.md) or [Filters in Platform Analytics](interactive-filters-workspace.md).

**Note:** There are role and ownership requirements for editing a component that is shared from a library. If you aren’t allowed to edit an element, create a local version that is not linked to the library and edit that one. For more information, see [Edit a copy of a shared dashboard element](editing-local-copy-saved-dv.md).

</td></tr><tr><td id="d89902e219">

**Resize the element**

</td><td>

Focus on the element. To increase its height, press **Resize**. To decrease its height, press Shift-**Resize**. To change its width or overall size, select a corner of the element and drag it.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d89902e359">

**Configure a data visualization to follow or not follow filters**

</td><td>

Data visualizations follow filters by default. A data visualization follows filters in the same tab as itself or above the tabs. Data visualizations either follow all such tabs that target their data sources, or none.For configuration instructions, see [Configure a data visualization to follow filters or not](configure-dv-follow-filters-or-not.md).

</td></tr><tr><td id="d89902e377">

**Set drilldown options**

</td><td>

Choose what happens when you select a visualization or one of its segments. The procedure depends on the type of dashboard. The default drilldown from a dashboard opened in Platform Analytics experience or any other workspace/experience is to Core UI artifacts.-   For a dashboard created in the inline editor and viewed in Platform Analytics experience, choose a preconfigured Chart Interaction. For more information, see [Chart interactions in a data visualization](dv-chart-interactions.md).
-   For a dashboard created in the inline editor and viewed in a workspace/experience other than the Platform Analytics experience, see [Configure custom redirection from a dashboard component](config-custom-redirection-from-db.md). The inline dashboard first has to be enabled to be viewed in the workspace, and then has to be referenced from a page built from the Dashboards page template, as described in [Add a dashboard to a Dashboards page](add-dashboard-to-workspace.md).
-   For a technical dashboard, see [Add a drilldown event to a data visualization on a technical dashboard](add-custom-drilldown-event.md).
