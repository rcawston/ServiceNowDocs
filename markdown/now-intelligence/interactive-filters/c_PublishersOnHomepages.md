# Interactive Filters on dashboards

You can make an Interactive Filter available to users by adding the filter to a dashboard.

To be effective, interactive filters must be based on the same tables as the reports they filter. Reports based on the user table, for example, do not follow Interactive Filters that are based on the incident table. For more information, see [Make a report follow interactive filters](t_MakeAReportASubscriber.md).

Performance Analytics widgets on the dashboard do not follow interactive filters. Separately filter those widgets on the same breakdown source by using the breakdown dashboard controls. For more information, see [Using breakdowns on dashboards](../performance-analytics/c_SpecialDashboards.md).

When you add interactive filters to a Core dashboard, you can configure the reports on the dashboard to accept input from interactive filters. For example, you add a filter on the Incident table's Active field. Reports on the Incident table can reflect the user's choice from that filter.
