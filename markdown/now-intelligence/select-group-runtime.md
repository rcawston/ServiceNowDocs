# Select a group-by value in a data visualization as a viewer

A viewer of a data visualization can select the value for grouping the data in the visualization.

If a data visualization is configured with alternative group-by values, a viewer can pick which value to apply. No editing rights are required. On a visualization that shows Service Catalog data, the options can include Service Catalog variables, as described in [Service catalog variables in data visualizations](dv-rep-sc-variables.md#).

**Note:** Instructions for configuring alternative group by are included in the data options topics for the relevant data visualizations.

Toggle the visibility of the selector for group-by values by selecting **Change group by** in the data visualization's More actions menu. An editor of the visualization can set whether the selector is visible or hidden by default.

All data visualizations that support group by also let viewers select the group-by value, except for pivot tables. For all such data visualizations except bar visualizations, you have only a single group-by value to select.

If you are viewing a bar visualization, you can choose a stack-by value as well as a group-by value.

In a time series visualization that shows more than one metric, you might have the option of selecting a group-by for each metric. You are given only valid choices.
