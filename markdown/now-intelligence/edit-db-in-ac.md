# Edit Platform Analytics dashboards

You can edit dashboard and dashboard tab information in the inline editor. If the dashboard has been shared, any changes you make are applied globally.

## Before you begin

You can edit the details of dashboards created in the inline editor and in the technical editor in the Platform Analytics experience. When you edit elements in dashboards created in the technical editor, you’re redirected to UI Builder.

Role required: dashboard\_admin for all dashboards, or any role for dashboards that you own or ones that you have been given the right to edit. See [Platform Analytics dashboard roles](pa-dashboard-roles.md) for more information about viewing and editing rights on dashboards.

## About this task

**Important:** By default, dashboards are subject to edit lock. Only one person at a time can have the same dashboard in edit mode. If you are viewing a locked dashboard, you will not have an **Edit** button even with edit rights. You will see the locking user's initials next to the **Refresh** and **View dashboard details** icons. Hover on the initials to see the user's name, company, and roles.

The **More actions** menu includes the option to clear the edit lock. Use this option with caution.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Platform Analytics** &gt; **Library** &gt; **Dashboards**.

2.  Select the dashboard that you want to edit.

    If you are in a different application scope than the dashboard, use the application picker to select the correct scope.
