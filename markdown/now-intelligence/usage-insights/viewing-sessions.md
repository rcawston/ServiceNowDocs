# Viewing session analytics

The Usage Insights Sessions page in the Data Foundation module lists filterable application sessions you can drill down into for more detailed insights. Refine the sessions list to focus on data such as selected screens or events for your application.

To view the Sessions overview, navigate to **Platform Analytics** &gt; **Usage Insights**, select an application, and then select the **Data Foundation** &gt; **Sessions** module. Select a User ID in the Sessions list to view that user's sessions.

Date

</td><td>

Date the session occurred.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Duration

</td><td>

Length of time the session lasted.-   **Note:** Usage Insights tracks a maximum session length of four \(4\) hours.

-   **Note:** On the legacy dashboard, session start times were based on the server clock, which applied uniformly. After the replatforming, session start times are based on the client clock, which can differ slightly between users \(for example, due to local time settings or sync delays\). This can cause a minor variation, typically less than 2%, in total session counts.

Automatically generated number assigned to each unique user of an application version. Can be used instead of an internal User ID. Select the User ID to view the user's sessions and Activity timeline.

Generated hashed `sys_id` value for each user. Actual user IDs are not displayed; instead they are automatically hashed via the SHA-256 hash function.**Note:** Users not logged into the portal are displayed as “Anonymous”.

</table>## Filter options

You can filter a Users list by date range, user type, and country by default. Using the **Add filter** option, you can filter on Locale, Department, Role, Group, and Manager.

**Note:** The Add filter options use a logical AND operator, meaning that the results must meet both the criteria in the default filters AND the criteria in the additional filters to be included in the visualizations.

## Session breakdown analysis

You can view a breakdown analysis of sessions by grouping them according to country, state, device type, hourly usage, and so on. The Geographic Analytics visualization, which was available until the Xanadu release, has been replaced by this Analysis Breakdown.
