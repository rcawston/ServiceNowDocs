# Content not migrated or migrated in compatibility mode

Most dashboard content is migrated to the new Platform Analytics experience. However, some visualizations, aspects of visualizations, filters, and configurations cannot be migrated. Dashboards with this content are migrated as embedded content \(iframes\), also known as compatibility mode.

**Note:** If you have already migrated to Platform Analytics experience, the Migration Center automatically migrates any previously incompatible content that is now compatible when you upgrade releases.

## Not migrated

The only generic dashboard configurations that is not migrated is widget title alignment.

Filters that are not migrated

-   Debug filter
-   Filter user preferences from dashboards
-   Cascading filters that support the Choice &gt; Choice configuration
-   Filtered list content. For more information on List filters, see [Create a filter in List](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/t_CreatingFilters.md).

Visualization configurations that are not migrated:

-   Restriction of dashboard access to specific roles.
-   Group edit rights.

    Reports that are shared to groups with edit rights only retain view rights when migrated. Open the migrated visualization in the library and share it with the group again. For more information, see [Share a data visualization in the Visualization Designer](share-dv-ac.md#).

-   In the context of bulk migration, visualizations that are used in one or more dashboards lose their header and color configurations. \(In Core UI, these are configured at the dashboard level; in Platform Analytics experience, they are configured at the visualization level.\)

    In the context of partial migration, visualizations that are used in a single dashboard are migrated with their header and color configurations. Visualizations that are used in multiple dashboards lose their header and color configurations.


Indicators/Breakdown Scorecard elements that are not migrated:

-   Show Distribution
-   Show Bullet chart

Calendar component elements that are not migrated:

-   Year view
-   Highlighting based on

## Compatibility mode migrations

Migration in compatibility mode means that all of the dashboard's original artifacts are inserted into the migrated dashboard in iframes. The original content is not changed or moved.

Dashboards with any content that is not a Performance Analytics widget, report, or interactive filter, including all custom interactive filters, custom content blocks, gauges, and gadgets, are migrated in compatibility mode, as iframes.

**Note:** Dashboards migrated in compatibility mode may experience performance issues.
