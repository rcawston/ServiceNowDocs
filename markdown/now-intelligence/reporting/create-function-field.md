# Create a function field

Create a function field to be able to group and stack a report by the results of the field's calculation.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin, function\_field\_admin

Each function field requires a label, a return type, and a definition. The definition consists of the operation and one or more fields that the operation is performed on.

**Note:** It isn’t possible to change the label or the return type after you save a function field. If necessary, deactivate the function field and start again.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Platform Analytics** &gt; **Library** &gt; **Data Visualizations** and select **New**.

2.  Select the report that you want to add a function field to.

    When you configure a function field on a table, it is available anywhere you use the table on the ServiceNow AI Platform, including any report on the same table. For example, a function field that calculates the age of open incidents is available for all reports on the incident table.

3.  Open the **Configure** tab and select **Configure function field**.

4.  Enter the field name in the search bar to see if someone has already created the function field.

    Hover over the search results to see the function definition.

5.  Select **Create**.

    There can be a maximum of 20 active function fields on the table the report is based on. If the table already has 20 function fields, a creator of one of the fields or a user with the admin role must deactivate or delete one.

6.  Specify the **Label**.

    The label is the name users can see when they group or stack data in a report.

7.  Select the **Return type**.

    The return type is the kind of information the function produces. For example, the `datediff()` function returns a Duration type because it calculates the duration between two dates.

    **Note:** You do not see a message if your return type is not a logical result of the function.

8.  Select the Operation.

    The **Syntax** text box shows the name of the function preceded by `glidefunction:`.

9.  Select the fields that the function operates on.

    Some functions require only one field; some require two or three fields. See [Report on function fields](function-fields-reporting.md). Make sure that you separate the fields with commas.

10. When the syntax is correct, you can save the function field.

    When the syntax is incorrect, you see the message: `Syntax error: Invalid expression`. You may also see other messages.

## Result

Configured function fields appear in the **Group by** and **Additional group by** lists after you save the report.

Use the created function field it in your report or data visualization configuration.
