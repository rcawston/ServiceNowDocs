# Create an Indicator Scorecard

The Indicator Scorecard component enables users to visualize and compare data between multiple Performance Analytics indicators. It highlights the information regarding the last score collected, the change from the previous data point, the trend over time, and the value of the target to achieve.​

## Before you begin

Role required: Anyone with access to data can create a visualization of that data on any dashboard that they can edit. Users with the itil, report\_user, admin, or viz\_creator role can create a visualization in the Visualization Designer. When you create a visualization in the Visualization Designer, it is saved to the Library. For more information on access, see [Report\_view access control](reporting/report-view-access-control.md) and [Platform Analytics roles](platform-analytics-roles.md).

## About this task

For information about the use of an Indicator Scorecard in a dashboard, see [the Developer Site](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/reference/now-experience/xanadu/shared-components/sn-scorecard-list/usage). This site gives information about Indicator Scorecard components in the UI Builder, and some configuration options may differ from the Visualization Designer.

**Note:** You aren’t able to sort by previous scores in UI Builder.

2.  Select **Create data visualization**.

3.  Select the Indicator Scorecard \(![Indicator Scorecard icon](../image/inline-data-vis-scorecard.png)\) visualization type.
