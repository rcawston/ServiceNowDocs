# Modify Script Includes for milestone icons in Portfolio Planning Workspace

Modify the Script Includes for milestone icons of the roadmap and portfolio plan to customize the icons to be shown in the Roadmap tab in the workspace.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Definition** &gt; **Script Includes**.

2.  From the list, select RoadmapMilestoneAPIImpl.

3.  Update the milestone icon type in the **Script** field of the Script Include.

    In the **getMilestoneMetadata** method, update the return value to the required icon.

    For example, if you want to display the Circle exclamation icon \(![Circle exclamation outline icon.](../../spw-roadmap/images/circle-exclamation-outline.png)\) for key event milestone, update the return value to `'circle-exclamation-outline'` for the key\_event milestone.

    The default icons are as follows:

    -   key\_event: `'flag-fill'`
    -   launch\_date: `'rocketship-fill'`
    -   important\_date: `'calendar-clock-fill'`
    -   key\_milestone: `'diamond-fill'`
    -   deadline: `'star-fill'`
