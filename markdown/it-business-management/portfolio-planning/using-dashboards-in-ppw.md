</table>**Note:** You can create widgets in dashboards by configuring any available data source table in the ServiceNow AI Platform. However, you must have read access to the source tables to view key data, metrics, or visualizations.

For example, if you create a widget in a dashboard configuring the Cost Plan Breakdown table to display budget data, the budget summary is visible on the dashboard only if you have read access to the Cost Plan Breakdown table. Similarly, when you share this dashboard with a stakeholder, the stakeholder must also have read access to the Cost Plan Breakdown table to view the budget summary.

-   **[Execution Dashboard in Portfolio Planning Workspace](execution-dashboard-ppw.md)**  
The Execution Dashboard helps portfolio and product managers gain real-time visibility into delivery progress across work items, enabling portfolio leads to detect delays, course-correct early, and keep the strategy on track.
-   **[View a dashboard in Portfolio Planning Workspace](view-dashboard-ppw.md)**  
View key data and metrics on a dashboard to monitor performance, track progress, and make informed decisions related to planning and execution.
-   **[Create a dashboard](create-dashboard-ppw.md)**  
In the Platform Analytics experience, you can create shareable dashboards with data visualizations, filters, and other elements. You can use the available elements in the inline editor to create different types of widgets as needed.
-   **[Duplicate a dashboard](copy-dashboard-ppw.md)**  
If the dashboard you want to create is similar to an existing one, duplicating the existing dashboard saves your time. After duplicating the dashboard, you can customize the tabs and widgets as required.
-   **[Share a dashboard](share-dashboard-ppw.md)**  
Share a dashboard with stakeholders, planning managers, portfolio managers, or product managers to provide visibility into work progress and foster collaboration. You can grant either view-only rights or both view and edit rights to a shared dashboard.
-   **[Add a Platform Analytics dashboard](add-platform-dashboard-to-ppw.md)**  
If you have existing dashboards created using Platform Analytics, you can add them to the Portfolio Planning Workspace to access them directly from a single location.
