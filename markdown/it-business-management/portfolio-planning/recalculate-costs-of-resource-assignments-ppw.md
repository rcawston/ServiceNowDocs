# Recalculate costs of resource assignments of a demand

Recalculate the costs of all active resource assignments of a demand whenever the hourly rates change in the associated rate model. This feature helps keep the plan costs are up to date.

## Before you begin

-   The demand must be active.
-   The demand must have an active rate model assigned.

Role required: it\_demand\_manager

## Procedure

1.  Open a demand from the home page of Next Experience for Demand Management.

    For more information, see [Access demands](access-demands-ppw.md).

2.  Select **Details** from the L-2 \(level 2\) navigation menu.

3.  Select the **Resource assignments** tab.

    **Note:** If the required **Resource assignments** tab isn’t visible, select **More** and then select the required **Resource assignments** tab.

4.  Select the resource assignment record that you want to recalculate the costs for.

5.  Select the More Actions option and select **Recalculate Resource Cost**.![Use the Recalculate Resource Cost button to recalculate the costs of a resource.](../../spw-demand/images/recalculate-resource-cost-button.png)
