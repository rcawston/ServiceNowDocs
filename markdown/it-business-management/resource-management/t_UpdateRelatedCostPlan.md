# Update cost plan related to a resource plan

If a resource plan is associated to a project, project task, or demand and has a related cost plan, then a requester or a resource manager can update the related cost plan after updating the resource plan.

## Before you begin

Role required: resource\_user or resource\_manager or it\_project\_manager or it\_demand\_manager

## About this task

If a resource plan does not have a related cost plan, the **Update Cost Plan** related link is not displayed for the resource plan.

## Procedure

1.  Save the updates to the resource plan.

2.  Click the **Update Cost Plan** related link.

    The cost plan associated to a resource plan is automatically updated as soon as the **Planned cost** in the resource plan is updated. The planned cost on resource plan gets updated when there is a change in:

    -   Planned hours
    -   User
    -   State
    -   Start and end dates

## Result

The cost plan associated to the resource plan is updated as follows:

-   If the resource plan is in Planning or Requested state, planned hours is updated in the cost plan.
-   If the resource plan is in Confirmed/Allocated state and the Confirmed/Allocated hours are less than planned hours, then the higher of the planned cost and Confirmed/Allocated cost is updated in the cost plan.
-   If the resource plan is in Confirmed/Allocated state and the Confirmed/Allocated hours are equal to or more than planned hours, then the Confirmed/Allocated cost is updated in the cost plan.

Cost from resource plan will be interfaced to the unit\_cost field on the Cost Plan \[cost\_plan\] table.
