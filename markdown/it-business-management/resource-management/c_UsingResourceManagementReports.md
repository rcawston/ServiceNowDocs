# Resource Management reports

Resource Management reports provide the resource requester and resource managers with resource allocations, availability, and utilization.

**Important:** Resource Management reports is deprecated starting Zurich release. It will be hidden and no longer available for installation but will continue to be supported. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

Alternatively, resource managers are encouraged to use the interactive Overview Dashboard in the Resource Management Workspace. For more information about dashboards, see [Overview dashboard in Resource Management Workspace](using-rmw.md#overview-dashboard).

You can generate reports for the following types of information:

-   **Availability**

    Total time that the resources are available after both [Soft and hard allocations](r_AllocatingResources.md#soft-and-hard-allocations). Availability is capacity minus allocation. ![A group availability report](../image/group_availability_report1.png)

-   **Forecasted Utilization**

    Percentage of forecasted resource time utilization. It is calculated as sum of allocated and confirmed hours, divided by the total capacity. ![Forecasted utilization report for a group](../image/group_utilization_forecasted.png)

-   **Committed Utilization**

    Percentage of committed resource time utilization. It is calculated as allocated hours divided by the total capacity. ![Committed utilization report for a group](../image/group_utilization_committed.png)

-   **Allocation**

    Resource capacity, allocations, availability, and utilization. ![Allocation report for a group](../image/allocation_report_user1.png)

-   **Allocation details**

    A tabular breakdown of all allocation requests \(soft bookings\), committed allocations \(hard bookings\), availability, capacity, and actual hours.

    If the actual hours for a resource is greater than the allocated hours, the actual hour's cell is highlighted and a message is displayed on mouse hover.
