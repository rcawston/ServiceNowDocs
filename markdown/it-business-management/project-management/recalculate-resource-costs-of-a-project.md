# Recalculating costs of all resource plans in a project

Recalculate the resource costs of all resource plans in a project whenever the hourly rates change in the associated rate model so that the plan costs are up to date.

## Before you begin

Ensure the following setup:

-   The project must be active.
-   The project must have an active rate model assigned.
-   The resource plans must be in the Planned, Requested, Confirmed, or Allocated state.

Role required: project\_manager

## About this task

This option recalculates the costs of all resource plans of the project at once. You can also open a resource plan from the **Resource Plans** related list to [recalculate the resource costs of an individual resource plan](../resource-management/recalculate-resource-costs.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Project** &gt; **Projects** &gt; **All**.

2.  Open a project.

3.  On the Project form, right-click on the header bar and select the **Recalculate Resource Costs** option.

4.  In the Recalculate Resource Cost dialog box, fill in the fields.
