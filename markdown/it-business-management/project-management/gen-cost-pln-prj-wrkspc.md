# Generate labor costs

Generate labor costs based on the planning attributes configured for financials in the planning attributes page for the resource assignments in a project.

## Before you begin

-   Review the planning attributes enabled for financials. For more information, see [Using the Planning attributes](planning-attributes.md).
-   Role required: it\_project\_manager

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Project** &gt; **Projects** &gt; **All** and select the required project.

    Make sure that the resource assignments are finalized to generate cost plans. If there are no resource assignments for the project, migrate the resource plans to resource assignments. For more information, see [Migrate resource plans and cost plans for projects and demands](../resource-management/migrate-rsrc-plan-rsrc-asgnmnt.md).

2.  Generate labor costs using one of the following options.
