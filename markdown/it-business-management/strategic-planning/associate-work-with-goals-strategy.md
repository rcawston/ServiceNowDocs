# Align work with a goal or target

Create a goal or target relationship with a planning item or any other item to identify and associate your current or future work and achieve your goals and targets.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_apw\_advanced.spw\_goal\_user

## About this task

You can associate a goal or target with planning items as well as with any ServiceNow AI Platform table record.

From the Align work window, you can associate a goal or target with multiple planning items at a time. From the Planning items tab of the goal or target, you can associate a goal or target with only one planning item at a time.

You can create goal or target relationships with a custom planning item from the Align work window only if the planning item table is added to the **planning\_item\_types\_allow\_list** property. For more information, see [Enable custom item types in Strategic Planning](../scenario-planning-in-spw/enable-custom-item-types-strategic-planning-workspace.md).

**Note:** When a goal or target relationship is created with a planning item \(Project, Demand, or Epic\) or any other ServiceNow AI Platform table record, the record appears on the Aligned work tab on the goal record.
