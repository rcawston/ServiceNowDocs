# Create an entity from a demand

Create an entity, such as a work item, from a demand so that you can track work on the demand.

## Before you begin

A demand must have been created. For more information, see [Create a demand](create-demand-from-dw.md).

The category and type of a demand and the applications you have installed determine the entity you can create from it. The available entity types and the applications you must have installed to be able to create them are listed in the following table.

|Entity|Required application|
|------|--------------------|
|Enhancement, change, or defect|[Project Portfolio Suite](../ppm-collaboration/c_ProjectPortfolioSuite.md)|
|Agile Development entities \(story or epic\)|[Agile Development 2.0](../agile-development/agile-landing-page.md)|
|Enterprise Agile Planning \(EAP\) entities \(epic, feature, or capability\)|[Strategic Planning](alignment-planner-workspace-landing-page.md)|

Role required: it\_demand\_manager

**Note:** The sn\_apw\_advanced.eap\_user role is required to convert a demand to EAP entities.

## Procedure

1.  Open a demand from the home page of Next Experience for Demand Management.

    For more information, see [Access demands](access-demand-workspace.md).

2.  Verify that the values in the **Category** and **Type** fields are appropriate for the entity you want to create.

    The options in the Type list change according to the category that you select. For more information, see [Demand form](demand-form-dw.md).

    **Note:** The **Category** and **Type** fields are set to read only when an entity is created from a demand. If you delete the created entity, these fields become editable again.

3.  Select **Save**.

4.  Create the entity by selecting the appropriate option from the More Actions option.![Create Project in the More Actions option.](../images/demand-create-entity.png)

    Depending on the category and type of the demand, options related to the entity you can create become available.

    |Option|Description|

    |**Create Project**|This option appears if the **Category** field is set to **Strategic** and the **Type** field is set to **Project**. Creates a project that is associated with this demand.
