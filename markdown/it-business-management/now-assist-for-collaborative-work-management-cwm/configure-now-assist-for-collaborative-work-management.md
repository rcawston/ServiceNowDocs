Role required: admin

## About this task

Use the Now Assist Admin console to configure Now Assist for SPM. All Now Assist for SPM skills are activated by default. If a skill isn't automatically activated or you want to update its configuration, follow the steps below.

Use the Now Assist Admin console to activate the following skills of Now Assist for CWM.

-   CWM Doc generation and insights

    The skills for CWM are displayed as tiles.

3.  For the skill that you want to activate, select **Activate skill**.

4.  Review the skill configuration settings from the following sections.

    **Note:** The display options are available based on the skill.

    1.  Choose inputs: These are the skill settings for summarizing and refining selected content within a CWM Doc page.

        This section is not available for the Tasks generation skill.

    2.  Select **Save and continue**.
    3.  Define access: Review who has access to skills.
        -   Configure ACLs or role-based permissions to ensure who can view or edit the skills.
        -   Review role restrictions to skill.
    4.  Page inputs: These are the skill settings for summarizing the whole content of a CWM Doc page.
    5.  Select **Save and continue**.
    6.  Select display:
        -   In-product desktop: Enabling this option shows the skill within the CWM workspace.
