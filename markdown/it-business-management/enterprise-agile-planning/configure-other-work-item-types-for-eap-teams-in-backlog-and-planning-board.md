# Configure display of other work item types in EAP Backlog and Planning board

Enable viewing different work item types in the Backlog and Planning board pages for EAP teams such as Portfolio, Solution Train, Agile Release Train, or Agile Team.

## Before you begin

Ensure that you set the **Application Scope** in your instance to **Strategic Planning**.

Role required: sn\_apw\_advanced.eap\_admin

## About this task

The Planning board for an EAP team shows only those work items that are enabled in its default configuration. For example, for a Solution Train with Full Configuration, the Backlog and Planning board show only Capabilities by default. If your product managers or team members want to switch between viewing other work item types such as Features, Epics, or Stories, you can enable it by updating the team-level configuration details.

This task provides guidance on updating the **Planning work types** or **Backlog work types** fields for your Agile teams in the Enterprise agile configuration details table \[sn\_apw\_advanced\_eap\_configuration\_detail\].

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Enterprise Agile Planning** &gt; **EAP Configurations**.

2.  Select a configuration that you need to update the work item type selections for.
