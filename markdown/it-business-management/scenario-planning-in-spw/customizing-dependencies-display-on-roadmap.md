# Customizing the dependencies display on the roadmap in Strategic Planning Workspace

Improve the efficiency of identifying the relationships between your planning items by choosing how the dependencies are displayed on the roadmap view.

The Personalize \(![Personalize icon.](../images/personalize-icon.png)\) side panel on the roadmap provides different toggles to personalize the display of dependencies on your roadmap.

-   For portfolio plan roadmaps, these toggles are always available.
-   For free-form roadmaps, these toggles are available only if the roadmap's source table is the Planning Item table \[sn\_align\_core\_planning\_item\] or one of its extensions.

**View dependencies**

 Indicates dependencies in the form of circles on either side of the planning item bars.

 These circles either contain a number inside them \(![Dependency circle.](../images/icon-dependency-circle.png)\), indicating the number of dependencies that item shares, or is colored red \(![Dependency error icon.](../images/icon-dependency-error.png)\) indicating a conflicting dependency.

 **Note:** This toggle must be enabled to use the other two toggles in the Dependencies section.
