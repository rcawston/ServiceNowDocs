# Managing portfolio financials in Strategic Planning Workspace

View the financial breakdown of estimates, approved costs, benefits, and actuals and so on for portfolio financials.

As a portfolio user, you can view the rolled up financial values of top-level demands, projects, and epics.

You can view the costs by expense type or cost type. Using the Financials view at portfolio level, you can view different financial fields such as Budget \(approved budget for planning items\), Forecast, Variance \(difference between the approved budget and latest forecast\), Actuals, and the Remaining Estimates for Capex, Opex, Total, and Benefits for each planning item. This information can be used to track the financials status of the planning items and take an informed decision on which planning items to consider while working on the next planning cycle and track the to avoid overspending.

Using the portfolio financials, portfolio managers can:

-   Track the financial performance and status of planning items.
-   Arrive at an informed decision by analyzing the estimated cost and benefits of a planning item while planning and prioritizing for the next Portfolio cycle.
-   View the financials based on the expense type or cost type depending on the [budget attribute configuration](config-budget-allocation-attribute-spw.md).
-   Avoid overspending on planning items by comparing the approved budget with the latest forecast and actuals.

**Important:** New and existing customers need to configure the portfolio financials to view the financials of your planning items at portfolio level. For more information, see [Configure portfolio financials in Strategic Planning](config-portfolio-fin-spw.md).

The portfolio financials view supports Demands, Epics, and Projects with Fiscal Calendar type configuration only.

**Note:** Group header row displays the rolled up values for Budget, Forecast, Variance, Actuals, and Remaining estimate of all the planning items in the group.

The default view of portfolio financials is set to display the planning items grouped by their budget approval status. Budget approved grouping lists the planning items which have the budget allocated and approved. Approval pending grouping lists the planning items which do not have any budget or if the requested budget is not approved.

**Note:** Portfolio financials view is not yet compatible with Investment Funding. This view may not show the right budget values allocated to planning items from Investment Funding application. This will be add as a future enhancement.

In the left-grid, planning item details such as name, rank, planning state, planning item type, approved start date, total planned cost, total actual costs, total planned benefits and ROI for the full planning item duration.

In the right-grid, financial attributes of the planning items such as, Budget, Forecast, Variance, Actuals, and Remaining Estimates for Capex, Opex, Total, and Benefits portfolio for the portfolio timeline or breakdowns by year, quarter, month, or period.

**Tip:** You can select the name of a planning item from the left-grid to directly access the financials record page of that planning item.

You can export the portfolio financials details to Excel or CSV using the **Export** option \(![Downward facing arrow indicating download option.](../images/fin-export-option.png)\).
