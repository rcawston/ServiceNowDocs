# Share a portfolio plan with stakeholders

Share your portfolio plan with stakeholders and other planning managers so that they have visibility into the plan's progress and start collaborating.

## Before you begin

-   [Create a portfolio plan](create-portfolio-plans-in-alignment-planner-workspace.md).
-   Users or groups that you want to share the portfolio plan with must have the sn\_align\_core.ap\_read\_only or sn\_align\_core.apw\_user role to get the read or edit access to the portfolio plan respectively.

Role required: sn\_align\_core.apw\_user or business\_stakeholder

## About this task

Select individual users or groups to share the portfolio with.

When you share a portfolio plan with an individual user or a group, they can access the following data of the portfolio plan:

-   Planning page
    -   Prioritization, Roadmap, Kanban, Hierarchy tabs by default
    -   Capacity tab if the user has the sn\_align\_ws.spw\_capacity\_user or sn\_align\_ws.spw\_capacity\_read role
    -   Financials tab if the user has sn\_align\_ws.spw\_financial\_user role
-   Goals page if the user has the sn\_apw\_advanced.spw\_goal\_user role
-   Scoring page if the user has the sn\_align\_core.apw\_user role

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Strategic Planning Workspace** &gt; **Portfolio Planning**.

2.  From the list of portfolio plans, select one.

3.  From the portfolio plan header in the Planning page, select the **Share portfolio plan** icon \(![Share portfolio plan with users and groups](../images/icon-share-pp.png)\).

    **Note:** Alternatively, you can select Share actions icon \(![Share actions of a portfolio plan.](../images/share-actions-pp.png)\) and then select **Copy link** to copy a direct link to the portfolio plan that you can share with other users. The link provides access only to users who already have the required permissions.

4.  On the Share portfolio plan form, select users to share the portfolio plan with and set their access appropriately.

    1.  In the **Members or Groups** field, enter the names of individual users or groups.

    2.  From the **Access** field, select the access level as **Viewer** or **Editor** for the selected names.

        -   An editor can view and change the portfolio plan's settings and data.
        -   A viewer can comment and add attachments to the portfolio plan, but cannot modify the portfolio plan's settings or data.

            **Note:** Even if a user has the sn\_align\_core.apw\_user role, they cannot edit planning item data from the portfolio plan grid view or side panel when granted view-only access. However, users with the sn\_align\_core.apw\_user role can edit planning items and related tables from the record page.

5.  Select **Send invite**.


## Result

The selected individual and group users are notified of the portfolio plan sharing through an email.
