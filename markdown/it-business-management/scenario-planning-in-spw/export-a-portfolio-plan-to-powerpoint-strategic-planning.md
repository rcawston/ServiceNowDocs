## About this task

Export the portfolio plan status to Microsoft PowerPoint from Strategic Planning 

The following three PowerPoint templates are provided by default to generate a status report for your portfolio plan:

-   Portfolio plan status: Contains individual detailed slides for the top five items prioritized by rank.
-   Portfolio plan &amp; goals status: Contains slides for Goals and targets for this portfolio, achieved goals, goals at risk, and individual detailed slides for the top five items prioritized by rank.
-   Roadmap Template - default: Contains slides for Roadmap for this portfolio. You can export roadmap data for maximum period of a year at a time.

You can customize the type of the data to be shown in the generated report by updating a predefined template or by creating your own branded template. See [Create a Microsoft PowerPoint template](../export-to-powerpoint-for-application-portfolio-management/create-ppt-template.md).
