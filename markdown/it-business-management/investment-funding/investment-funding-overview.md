# Investment Funding

ServiceNow® Investment Funding enables you to plan and manage investments by allocating funds to investment entities such as Business Units, Products, Teams, and the like. Prioritize your investments based on business needs and strategic objectives of your organization.

You can use the Investment Funding \(sn\_invst\_pln\) application to do the following:

-   Create investments for entities.
-   Allocate funds to an investment to meet a business requirement or strategic objective.
-   Request funds from one or more funding sources to achieve business goals.

**Note:** Starting with the Rome release, Investment Funding will be found in the ServiceNow Store. The legacy plugins \(com.snc.investment\_planning, com.snc.investment\_planning\_pmo\) will be prepared for future deprecation in September 2022. The plugins will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support knowledge base.

## Investment entities and investments

An investment contains information about funds, costs, benefits, business case, and goals. Use investments to allocate or request funds to meet defined business goals. An investment is associated to an investment entity.

An investment entity is a transaction table for funding. For example, you can create investment entities for records such as Projects, Teams, Business Units, Epics, and Portfolios.

Keeping the investment and investment entity separate provides the following advantages:

-   Your work activities are separate from the funding.
-   You can fund the same entity for different periods until the investment goals are met.

## Generic investments

A generic investment is an investment that is tied an owner without being associated to any entity. You can fund any entity or other generic investment from a generic investment.

For example, as the CEO of a company you might want to set aside some funds for a training or research initiative and there might not be a transaction table to enable such an entity. You could then create a generic entity to fund the investment.

## Top-down and bottom-up funding

In top-down funding, you distribute funds to investments based on business goals or as part of a business strategy.

In bottom-up funding, you request funds for your investments from one or more funding sources.

Investment Funding enables you to manage funds for both funding approaches.
