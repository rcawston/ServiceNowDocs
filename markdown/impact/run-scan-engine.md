# Run your first scan with the Scan Engine

An initial full Scan Engine completion is required to set a baseline from a series of tasks performed that tune the instance environment to complete future scans quickly and efficiently.

## Before you begin

[Activate Scan Engine and review settings](configure-initial-scan-engine-settings.md) before beginning this task.

You can complete the configuration steps directly in the Guided Setup interface or can configure the properties using the indicated navigation path.

**Important:** Depending on the size of your instance, your first scan could take a few hours to complete. We recommend running your first scan overnight, especially in production instances.

Role required: impact app admin or admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Impact** &gt; **Platform Health** &gt; **Scheduled Scan**.

2.  Select **Execute Now**.

    The scan progress is tracked within Platform Health.

    **Note:** Scan Engine findings are not transmitted to Impact Delivery Instance through the Guided Setup integration.

3.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Impact** &gt; **Platform Health** &gt; **Scan Engine** &gt; **Scan Status**.

    See [Analytics Dashboards](scan-engine-diagnostic-dashboards.md):

    -   View the different charts and reports available at **Impact****Platform Health****Analytics Dashboard**.
    -   Access refreshed Health Scan Engine dashboards each time a scan is completed.
    The Scan Engine results display with the status of each table that is being scanned.

4.  Integrate with your other environments running Impact and utilize Scan Engine diagnostics.

    You can connect your instances with a one-time configuration, available in both Basic Auth and OAuth 2.0. Refer to [Scan Engine integrations](instance-integration-scan-engine.md) for details.

5.  **Mark as Complete** to progress to the next step in Guided Setup.
