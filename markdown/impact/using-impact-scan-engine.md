# Running on-demand scans

You can initiate some scan types on-demand to run whenever they are required.

You can initiate the following scan types on-demand.

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Application scans

</td><td>

Scan in-development applications to identify definition findings before publishing to the application repository. Application scans give insight into health scores, the number of findings, and the total impact of findings within your custom applications. **Note:** View application health scores in the Application Health dashboard by navigating to **ALL &gt; Impact &gt; Platform Health &gt; Application Health**. Health scores are calculated based on finding severity, count, and policy impact.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Limited definition scans 

</td><td>

Scan your instance against a single specified definition or definition suite.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Update set scans 

</td><td>

Scan open update sets for findings to get insights into what you are importing and exporting across your environments. 

</td></tr><tr><td>

Instance scans 

</td><td>

Scan your ServiceNow instance for findings. These scans return the findings and store them in the Opens Findings table.  **Note:** Only users with the Scan Engine Admin role can initiate instance scans.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>Scheduled instance scans can be executed immediately using the **Execute Now** action, but they cannot bypass their configured schedule settings. Real-time scans run automatically during record saves and cannot be manually triggered.

**Note:** The Scan Engine integrates with certain development tools, such as App Engine Studio, ServiceNow Studio, and script editors. It scans business rules, script `includes`, UI scripts, client scripts, ACLs, record producers, and other script-containing records in real-time as they are saved.

Scans are initiated in different ways. They run using the Scan Engine properties you configured.

For more information, see [Configure Scan Engine properties](configure-scan-engine-properties.md) and [Configure definition properties](additional-scan-engine-properties.md).
