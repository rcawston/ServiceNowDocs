# Create a scheduled extraction in Zero Copy Connector for ERP

Schedule extraction of information for an ERP \(Enterprise Resource Planning\) extraction table to capture large amounts of data from the system of record at a regular interval.

## Before you begin

**Important:**

If you have existing scheduled extractions and have upgraded to Zurich or Australia, run the **Scheduled Extraction V2 Move** fix script to place scheduled extractions in a new table where scheduling is done by the scheduled scripts engine. For detailed steps, see [Run fix scripts](../../application-development/t_RunFixScripts.md).

You must have a standard or custom ERP extraction table in place to use. For more information, see [Add a new ERP extraction table in Zero Copy Connector for ERP](erp-canvas-add-new-extraction-table.md).
