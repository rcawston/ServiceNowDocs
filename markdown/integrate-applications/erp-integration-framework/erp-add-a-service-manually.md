# Add an OData service manually in Zero Copy Connector for ERP

When adding an entity to a model using OData, if the service you need isn't listed, add the service manually in Zero Copy Connector for ERP \(Enterprise Resource Planning\).

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_erp\_integration.erp\_admin

You can connect to an ERP system based on a metadata URL or an uploaded metadata file \(xml\). The file option enables you to, for example, access data from SuccessFactors. For more information, see [Obtain data from SAP SuccessFactors using OData v2 APIs](obtain-data-from-successfactors-using-odata-v2-apis.md).

Before you can add a service manually, you must do the following:

-   Confirm that you have an SAP system that has been enabled to make an OData connection.
-   Enable the **sn\_erp\_integration.enableModelModification** property. For more information, see [Install Zero Copy Connector for ERP](install-erp-integration.md).
-   Create a connection and credential alias, specifying HTTP as the **Connection type**. For more information, see [Create a Connection &amp; Credential alias](../../platform-security/connections-and-credentials/connection-alias.md).
-   Create an HTTP connection for the service. Add the connection alias that you created and the connection URL.
-   Create a system that uses the HTTP connection. For more information, see [Create an ERP system in Zero Copy Connector for ERP](create-an-erp-system.md). On the system record, confirm that the heartbeats are successful and the retrieval status is complete. If any have failed, select **Restart data retrieval**.
-   If you're going to connect using a URL, copy the metadata URL from the ERP system to which you're linking. Use the relative URL containing only the path following the domain, for example, v2/northwind/northwind.svc/$metadata.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Zero Copy Connector for ERP** &gt; **Zero Copy Connector for ERP Home**.

2.  Open the model page by selecting the models icon ![](../image/erpc-data-model-icon.png) in the side panel.

3.  Select the model to which you want to add an operation entity.

4.  Check that the correct system is selected in **ERP system**.

5.  Select the **Manage model** button.

6.  Select an operation.

    If you don't have an operation, see [Add an operation to a model in Zero Copy Connector for ERP](erpc-manage-models-read-op.md).

7.  Select **Select entity** on the **Manage entities** tab.

8.  In **Select type**, select **OData**.

9.  Select **+ Add service manually**.

10. If you're using a metadata URL, follow these substeps \(if you're uploading a metadata file, go to the next step\).

    1.  Select **Use metadata URL**.

        The **Connection URL** is added automatically based on the ERP system specified for the model. If no URL is listed or the listed URL is incorrect, edit the ERP system field on the model record.

    2.  Paste in the **Metadata URL** and click outside of the field.

    3.  Check that a **Service base URL** is filled in automatically and a **Service name** is created automatically.

        **Note:** If a **Service name** is not created, you have two options:

        -   Provide a different **Metadata URL**.
        -   In the **All** menu, enter `sn_erp_integration_odata_service_catalog.list` and delete the previous entry of service from the table.

    3.  Select an xml file and then select **Open**.
