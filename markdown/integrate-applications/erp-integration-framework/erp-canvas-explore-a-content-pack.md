# Explore a Zero Copy Connector for ERP content pack

Explore a Zero Copy Connector for ERP \(Enterprise Resource Planning\) content pack to see what it contains, including models and process extensions. Content pack models and process extensions are examples.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_erp\_integration.erp\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Zero Copy Connector for ERP** &gt; **Zero Copy Connector for ERP Home**.

2.  Open the ERP models page by selecting the models icon ![](../image/erpc-data-model-icon.png) in the side panel.

3.  Review the list of ERP models.

    Models that are part of a content pack have **DP** at the beginning of their ERP model name.

4.  Open a model from a content pack, for example **DP: Material Master**.

    **Note:** All fields are read only because content pack models can only be viewed, not edited.

5.  Review the model record for details including the short description, long text, and ERP module.

7.  If you plan to use the content pack model, you will need to clone the model; select **Clone** now.

    1.  Enter a label.

    2.  Check that the correct target application is specified.

    3.  Select **Clone this model**.
