# Debug Zero Copy Connector for ERP models

Use the debug models option in Zero Copy Connector for ERP \(Enterprise Resource Planning\) to see a log capturing the probe payload, payload response, status, and other information.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_erp\_integration.erp\_admin

## About this task

View debug logs from within Zero Copy Connector for ERP to obtain information about requests, responses, and payloads without having to open Workflow Studio.

Keep the following guidance in mind when debugging Zero Copy Connector for ERP models:

-   Turn debugging on and off as needed.
-   Debug logs are stored and accessible for the current session only.
-   Debug logs are cleared on a daily basis automatically.
-   When probe executions happen outside of "Use ERP Data" flows, only transaction IDs are stored. Flow context IDs are not stored.
-   For probe executions triggered via "Use ERP" flows, flow context IDs are stored.

## Procedure

1.  To turn on debugging, navigate to **All** &gt; **Zero Copy Connector for ERP** &gt; **Enable ERP Models Debugging**.

2.  Select **Confirm**.

3.  To view the logs, navigate to **All** &gt; **Zero Copy Connector for ERP** &gt; **Open Debug Logs**.

    Debug logs enable you to see information about flow engine context, probe communication, probe payload, payload response, status, and more.

    For details about the columns in debug logs, see [Zero Copy Connector for ERP debug logs field descriptions](erp-canvas-debug-logs-columns.md).

4.  To turn off debugging, navigate to **All** &gt; **Zero Copy Connector for ERP** &gt; **Disable ERP Models Debugging**.

5.  Select **Confirm**.
