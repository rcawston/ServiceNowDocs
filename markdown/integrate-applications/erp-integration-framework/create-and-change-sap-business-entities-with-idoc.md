# Create and change SAP business entities with IDoc

Work with SAP business entities that can only be created or changed using IDoc.

SAP still has some business entities that can only be created or changed using IDoc. In Zero Copy Connector for ERP \(Enterprise Resource Planning\), you can add IDoc entities to model operations and configure outbound messages. Monitor the asynchronous processing to obtain information about IDoc status and the business entity created or updated.

**Note:** IDoc can only be used with create or update operations, not read operations.

For details about IDoc, see the [SAP support website IDoc information](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_DATA_SERVICES/df959412681b4619a38f03ff90207e6b/577aa1b66d6d1014b3fc9283b0e91070.html).

You must have the sn\_erp\_integration.erp\_admin role to create and edit models.

1.  Manage partner profiles. For more information, see [View Zero Copy Connector for ERP partner profile information](view-erp-system-partner-profile-information.md).
