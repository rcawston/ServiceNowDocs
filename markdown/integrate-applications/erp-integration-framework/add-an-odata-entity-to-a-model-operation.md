# Add an OData entity to a model operation

Specify the OData entity that a Zero Copy Connector for ERP \(Enterprise Resource Planning\) model uses for a read, update, or create operation.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_erp\_integration.erp\_admin

You must have already added the read, write, or create operation before you can add an entity to it. For more information, see [Add an operation to a model in Zero Copy Connector for ERP](erpc-manage-models-read-op.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Zero Copy Connector for ERP** &gt; **Zero Copy Connector for ERP Home**.

2.  Open the ERP model page by selecting the models icon ![](../image/erpc-data-model-icon.png) in the side panel.

3.  Select the model that you want to add an operation entity to.

4.  Select the **Manage model** button.

5.  Select an operation.

6.  For help finding relevant entities using the **Ask AI** button, see [Use generative AI to help add an entity to a model](use-ai-to-help-add-an-entity-to-a-model.md).
