-   After enabling the property, Zero Copy Connector for ERP retrieves all tables and BAPIs \(Business Application Programming Interface\) to use when managing models.
-   The property must be configured for either a non-production or production state. \(Enabling the property on a production instance can create metadata records when new models and fields are added in Zero Copy Connector for ERP.\)
