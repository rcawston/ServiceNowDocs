# Secure Shell \(SSH\) connector methods

The Secure Shell \(SSH\) connector methods establish an SSH connection, execute commands over the established connection, and disconnect the session.

## Connect

Establishes an SSH connection. Provide the information required to connect to a remote machine.

Select the settings icon \(![Settings icon](../image/component-settings-icon.png)\) to choose the authentication type.

Supported authentication types are Password, KeyboardInteractive, and KeyFileAuthentication.![The authentication type configuration window displaying the Password, KeyboardInteractive, and KeyFileAuthentication as authentication types.](../image/ssh-connector-auth-types.png)

Password is the default authentication type.

Password

</td><td>

Secure string representation of the password. Password of the SSH account.

 You can use the SecureStringEncode component to encode the secure string password as mentioned in the following example. For more information, see [Use the SecureStringEncode component](use-security-encryption-securestringencode.md).

 After you perform this task, you can connect to the remote server.
