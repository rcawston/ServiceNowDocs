# Set a breakpoint to pause a component in RPA Desktop Design Studio

Set a breakpoint on a component in RPA Desktop Design Studio so that you can pause it for debugging purposes during an automation execution. You can set a breakpoint for any number of components.

## Before you begin

Ensure that the component or components where you want to set a breakpoint in are a part of your automation.

Configure a component. For more information, see [Use a component in RPA Desktop Design Studio](configure-components.md).

Role required: none

## Procedure

1.  In the RPA Desktop Design Studio, on the Design surface, right-click the title bar of the component where you want to set the breakpoint and then select **Breakpoint**.

    After a breakpoint is set on a component, you can see a red icon as shown in the following example.

    ![Red icon that appears after a breakpoint is set on a component.](../image/set-breakpoint-red.png "Red icon that appears after a breakpoint is set on a component")

    During the automation execution, when the robot reaches a component that has a breakpoint, the execution pauses and the component is highlighted with a red border, as shown in the following example.
