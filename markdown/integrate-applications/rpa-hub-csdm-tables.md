# RPA Hub and CSDM tables

RPA Hub manages and uses CSDM tables. Several ServiceNow products benefit from and add value to RPA Hub.

## CSDM tables managed by RPA Hub

1.  Bot Process \[cmdb\_ci\_rpa\_process\]
2.  Robot \[cmdb\_ci\_rpa\_robot\]

The Bot Process table \(cmdb\_ci\_rpa\_process\) contains the configuration details of a process that runs on a robot. This table extends from the Base Bot Process table \(cmdb\_ci\_base\_rpa\_process\). The following image is a visual depiction of the bot process table hierarchy. ![Visual depiction of the bot process table hierarchy.](../image/botprocess-ci-rpa-csdm.png)

The Robot table \(cmdb\_ci\_rpa\_robot\) contains the details of a software agent that runs a bot process \(cmdb\_ci\_rpa\_process\) that is built in the RPA Desktop Design Studio. This table extends from the Base Robot table \(cmdb\_ci\_base\_rpa\_robot table\). The following image is a visual depiction of the robot table hierarchy.

The bot process and the robot are associated with each other using CI relationship ‘Runs On::Runs’.
