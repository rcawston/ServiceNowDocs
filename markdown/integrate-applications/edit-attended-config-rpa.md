# Edit an attended configuration record in RPA Hub

Edit an existing attended configuration record in RPA Hub to modify a few details of the record.

## Before you begin

Ensure you are familiar with Embedded Task Automation concepts. For more information, see [Embedded Task Automation \(ETA\) in RPA Hub](embedded-task-auto-rpa.md).

Create an attended configuration record. For more information, see [Create an attended configuration record in RPA Hub](create-attended-config-rpa.md).

Ensure that the attended configuration record is in **Active** state.

Ensure that the RPA developer \(sn\_rpa\_fdn.rpa\_developer\) is in the Managed by Group list of the associated bot process that is assigned to an Attended Configuration record.

Role required: sn\_rpa\_fdn.rpa\_release\_manager, sn\_rpa\_fdn.rpa\_developer, or sn\_rpa\_fdn.rpa\_admin
