# Configure the JavaScript connector

Configure the JavaScript connector by writing custom script and validating custom classes and functions. Then you execute the script by providing values for the functions.

## Before you begin

Ensure you have installed the Scripting plugin on the RPA Desktop Design Studio. To install, see [Manage plugins in RPA Desktop Design Studio](install-plugins-rpa-studio.md).

Role required: Developer

## Procedure

2.  Drag the **JavaScript** connector to **Global Objects** in the Project Explorer pane.

3.  Right-click the **JavaScript** connector in **Global Objects** and select **Configure**.

    The Script Editor window is displayed.

4.  Enter the custom JavaScript in the Script pane.
