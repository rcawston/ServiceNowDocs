# Set up MID Server for a spoke

Configure MID Server settings on your ServiceNow instance that enables it to integrate with a third-party application via MID Server after you have set up the connection record for a spoke.

Demonstrates setting up MID Server for a spoke. 

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

Confirm that you have set up the connection record for the spoke.

## About this task

Setting up MID Server may be mandatory or optional for the spoke that you set up. For example, configuring MID Server is required for [Microsoft Active Directory v2 Spoke](ms-ad-v2-spoke.md) but optional for the [Jira Spoke](jira-spoke-v3-0-2.md). Use this procedure to set up the MID Server for your spoke after you have set up your spoke by filling the default connection alias form.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **IntegrationHub** &gt; **Connection &amp; Credential Alias**.

2.  Find the connection and credential alias of the spoke.

    Search the alias by entering its name in the **Name** field.![Enter alias name in the Name field.](../image/search-conn-alias.png)

3.  Under the **Name** column, select the connection and credential alias.
