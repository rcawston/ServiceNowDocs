# Set up the Jira spoke for Jira Cloud

Integrate your ServiceNow instance with the Jira Cloud instance to authenticate the requests from ServiceNow.

## Before you begin

-   Request an Integration Hub subscription.
-   Activate the Jira spoke.

## About this task

**Important:**

Starting with the Australia release, instructions for generating and using API tokens have been removed from our documentation to align with Atlassian's Acceptable Use Policy. See the Atlassian blog, [Building Secure and Scalable Integrations: Our Guidance for Third-Party Apps](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/developer/building-secure-and-scalable-integrations-our-guidance-for-third-party-apps) for more information.
