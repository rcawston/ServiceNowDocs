## About this task

**Important:**

Starting with the Australia release, instructions for generating and using API tokens have been removed from our documentation to align with Atlassian's Acceptable Use Policy. See the Atlassian blog, [Building Secure and Scalable Integrations: Our Guidance for Third-Party Apps](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/developer/building-secure-and-scalable-integrations-our-guidance-for-third-party-apps) for more information.

## Obtain the value of Cloud ID

Obtain the value of Cloud ID of the Jira Cloud instance. This value is required during the configuration of the connection record in your ServiceNow instance.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

### Procedure

1.  Log in to [Atlassian Administration](https://admin.atlassian.com/) as an admin.

2.  Click **Select** against the required organization.

3.  From the **Jira Software** product, click **Manage product access**.

    A new window is opened and the URL is in this format: `https://admin.atlassian.com/s/<Cloud-ID>/apps`.

4.  Copy the value of the Cloud ID for later use.
