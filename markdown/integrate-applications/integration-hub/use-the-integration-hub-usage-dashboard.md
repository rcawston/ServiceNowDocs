# Transaction reports in Integration Hub Usage Dashboard

The transaction reports in Integration Hub Usage Dashboard help you to understand the Integration Hub usage transactions.

## Overview section reports

-   **IH Transactions \(Tx\) Usage report**

    Depending on the package that your organization subscribes to, the Integration Hub subscription packages offer a certain number of transactions per year. See the details about the packages in [Integration Hub usage and subscription](subscription-usage.md). With this report, you can learn about the total usage of the Integration Hub transactions versus the subscribed package of transactions in the last year. The following diagram shows what you can learn from viewing the Integration Hub transactions usage.

The Transactions \(Tx\) by Type report shows the transactions that you have performed in Integration Hub, External Content Connectors, and Orchestration. See the image.
