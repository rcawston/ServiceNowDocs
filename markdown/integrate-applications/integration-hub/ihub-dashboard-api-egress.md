# Data egress reports in the Integration Hub Usage Dashboard

The Data egress reports give insights on data egress from the ServiceNow instance through API protocols or export sets. You can view more information when you select specific records.

## Access the reports

Do the following steps.

1.  Select the **Data Egress** tab.
2.  Select the API or Export section that you want to view from the **Filter by** list.

    **Note:** The Overview section is selected by default.


## Overview section reports

Data Egress: Total volume of data egress by all sources.

Data Egress by source: Data egress volume by API protocols and export.

Data Egress Trends: Trends in data egress across the time period.

![Overview section that shows data egress.](../images/ihub-dashboard-overview.png)

**Note:** All charts are adjusted to the nearest data metric starting with Bytes.

## API section reports

Data Egress: Total volume of data egress by all API protocols.

Data Egress by API Protocols: Data egress volume by API protocols.

Data Egress Trends: Trends in data egress across the time period.

![API section showing data egress by protocols.](../images/ihub-data-egress-api-protocols.png)

**Note:** All charts are adjusted to the nearest data metric starting with Bytes.

## Export section reports

Data Egress: Total volume of data egress by both the export sets and URI.

Data Egress by Exports: Data egress volume by URI.

Data Egress Trends: Trends in data egress across the time period.

**Note:** All charts are adjusted to the nearest data metric starting with Bytes.

**Important:** The amount of data is mentioned in bytes and the abbreviations are as described in the following table.

|Abbreviation|Number|Value|
|------------|------|-----|
|K|Thousand|10^3|
|M|Million|10^6|
|B|Billion|10^9|
|T|Trillion|10^12|

That is, if the value displayed is **4.01M**, the amount of data transferred is 4.01 million bytes. In the preceding sample API Data Egress, the data amount of data transferred is 2.01 billion bytes.

Select the number to access details of the individual data transfers.

## View data insights

## Data egress by API protocols or exports

View data egress by various API protocols or exports.

Do the steps.

1.  Select the **Data Egress** tab.

    Confirm that in the Filter by list, Overview is selected.

2.  On the Data Egress by source report, select a source.

    ![Data egress by API protocols and exports.](../images/ihub-usage-dashboard-data-egress-api-exports.png)

## View data egress by API protocols or exports on a specified date

Select a date and API protocol or exports and view the data egress by the source you specified on that date.

Do the following steps.

1.  Select the **Data Egress** tab.

    Confirm that in the Filter by list, Overview is selected.

2.  On the Data Egress Trends report, move the pointer to a date and then select the source.

    ![Date and source selection for data egress report.](../images/ihub-dashboard-data-egress-by-date.png)

    All records of data egress by the date and source that you specified appears.


## View data egress by API protocols

View data egress by JSON, REST, or SOAP protocols, and then select a record from the data to view more information.

Do the steps.

1.  Select the **Data Egress** tab.
2.  From the Filter by list, select **API**.
3.  In the Data Egress by API Protocols report, select an API protocol, for example, REST.

    ![Selection of an API protocol.](../images/data-egress-by-api-prot.png)

    All records of data egress by the API protocol that you specified appears.

## Data generation in the reports

Data in the reports are generated from the `data_egress_count` table. [View](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1638468) how data is populated in the `data_egress_count`.
