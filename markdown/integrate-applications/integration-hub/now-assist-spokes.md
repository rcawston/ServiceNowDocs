## Available AI agents

This application provides standalone AI agents that mimic human-like intelligence to perform tasks in your ServiceNow instance.

Available AI agent includes, [Meeting scheduler AI agent](meeting-scheduler-ai-agent.md) that can be used to organize Zoom or Teams meetings and create regular calendar events. This AI agent retrieves details of available rooms, details of the relevant users you want to invite such as, email address and timezone, finds an available time slot, creates a calendar event, and generates a Zoom URL for the meeting.

## Role masking

Agentic workflows and their AI agents use [role masking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/aia-role-masking.md) to determine which users can access them. Ones installed with Now Assist applications have specific roles that come included with the application. If you select **Users with specific roles** for user access, you must configure the security controls to include these roles. For the instructions to change the security controls, see [Define security controls for an agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/define-sec-controls-aw.md).
