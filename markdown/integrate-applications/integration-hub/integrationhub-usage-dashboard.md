# Integration Hub Usage Dashboard

Get insights on the usage of Integration Hub data from the Integration Hub Usage Dashboard. For example, view the average number of monthly transactions in the last year or the data egress from Integration Hub via REST and SOAP API protocols.

The Integration Hub Usage Dashboard gives insights in the form of reports. Access to the dashboard is role-based. The reports are available under various sections in the **Transactions** and **Data Egress** tabs. You can customize the data that you want to view by using filters or drilling down reports.
