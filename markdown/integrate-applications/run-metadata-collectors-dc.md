# Running metadata collectors

A metadata collector run harvests technical metadata from the connected data platform and updates the Data Catalog. Collectors can run on demand or on a defined schedule. Runtime logs record the status and details of each run.

Collectors support two run modes:

-   Manual: An immediate, on-demand run. Use this after initial setup to verify that the collector connects and collects expected metadata
-   Scheduled: A recurring run at a defined interval. Use this to keep catalog metadata current as the source system changes
