# Create a glossary term

Create glossary terms to define business concepts and provide context for data assets.

## Before you begin

Role required: Data Steward \(df\_data\_steward\)

## About this task

Business glossary terms define business concepts and can be linked to catalog assets to provide business context. Terms include definitions, synonyms, related concepts, and ownership information. Use glossary terms to bridge the gap between technical data structures and business understanding. ![List of glossary terms](../image/dc-glossary-list.png)
