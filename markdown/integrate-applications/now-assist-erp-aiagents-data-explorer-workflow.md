# Explore ERP models agentic workflow

Use the Explore ERP models AI agent team in Now Assist for Zero Copy Connector to obtain information about working with ERP database tables and models.

## Explore ERP models agentic workflow overview

The Explore ERP models agentic workflow uses a team of AI agents to answer user questions about working with ERP database tables and identifying models configured in ERP content packs.

## Prerequisites for the Explore ERP models agentic workflow

-   The sn\_erp\_integration.erp\_ai\_user role is required to work with generative AI and agentic AI in Now Assist for ZCC.
-   You must have the Knowledge Graph plugin installed. For more information, see [Configuring Knowledge Graph](../intelligent-experiences/knowledge-graph/configuring-knowledge-graph.md).
-   Follow the steps in [Now Assist for Zero Copy Connector agentic workflow prerequisites](now-assist-erp-ai-agents-prereqs.md) before using the Explore ERP models agentic workflow.

## AI agents used in the Explore ERP models agentic workflow

The following agents are used in the Explore ERP models agentic workflow.

|AI agent|AI agent role|
|--------|-------------|
|ERP action invoker AI agent|Gathers information for a specific operation and generates mandatory and optional inputs. Users can fill in a form to provide values for the mandatory inputs. The AI agent then formats and sends the inputs to an action script that creates the operation.|
|ERP data fetcher AI agent|Retrieves information about relevant models and model operations. Currently supports Read operations.|
|ERP output formatter AI agent|Refines and formats the information from the ERP action invoker AI agent.|
