# Create an attended robot in RPA Hub

Create an attended robot in RPA Hub to run the attended bot process.

## Before you begin

Configure the related system property to view the activity stream. For more information, see [Display an activity stream for bot processes and robots in RPA Hub](display-activity-stream-sys-property-rpahub.md).

Role required: sn\_rpa\_fdn.rpa\_release\_manager, or sn\_rpa\_fdn.rpa\_admin

## About this task

A robot runs a bot process \(automation\).

Attended robots can execute attended automations that require human intervention. Using the Attended Robot application, you can run an attended robot to execute the attended bot process \(attended automations\).

An attended robot is mapped to only one user.
