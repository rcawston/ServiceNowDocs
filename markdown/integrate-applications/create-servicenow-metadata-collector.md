# Create a ServiceNow metadata collector

Create a collector to import metadata from ServiceNow.

## Before you begin

Before you begin, verify the following:

-   A MID Server is setup for the collectors. For more information, see [MID Server for metadata collectors](mid-server-for-metadata-collectors-dc.md).
-   All per-requisite tasks are completed. For more information, see [Prepare to run the ServiceNow collector](prepare-to-run-servicenow-collector.md).
-   Role required: connection-admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workflow Data Fabric** &gt; **Workflow Data Fabric Home**.

2.  Select the Connect Hub ![Connect Hub icon](../../../build/workflow-data-fabric/image/wdf-connect-hub-icon.png) icon in the left sidebar.

3.  Select **Create** &gt; **Metadata collector**.

4.  From the System list, select **ServiceNow**.

5.  Complete the form.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Connection name|Unique identifier for the connection. This field cannot be modified once the connection is established.|
    |Short description|Purpose and details of the connection.|

6.  Configure the instance URL.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |ServiceNow Instance URL|Base URL of your ServiceNow instance, such as `https://your-instance.service-now.com`. Do not include a trailing slash.|

7.  Configure the authentication options.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Username|ServiceNow user name to use for authentication.|
    |Password|Password for the specified username.|

8.  Select **Save**.


## Result

The metadata collector is created and appears on the Connectors page with a Configured status. It is now ready to connect to the source system and harvest metadata.

## What to do next

After creating the collector, you can perform any of the following tasks:

-   Run the collector manually to harvest metadata immediately. See [Run metadata collectors manually](run_metadata-collectors-manually.md).
-   Automate metadata collection by scheduling regular collector runs. See [Schedule metadata collector runs](schedule-metadata-collector-runs.md).
-   Monitor execution status and troubleshoot issues by viewing the runtime logs. See [View runtime logs for collector runs](view-runtime-logs-for-collector-runs.md).
-   Discover and evaluate the harvested data assets in the Data Catalog. See [Governing the Data Catalog](manage-data-catalog.md).
