# View current robot events in RPA Hub

View the current robot events on the **Robot Calendar** tab in RPA Hub for unattended robots. By using the calendar, you can manage and plan a robot's schedule in a single view.

## Before you begin

Create an unattended robot. On the robot form, ensure that you select the **Robot Type** field as **Unattended**. For more information, see [Create an unattended robot in RPA Hub](create-unattended-robot.md).

Establish the robot connection to an unattended bot process. For more information, see [Assign a robot to a bot process in RPA Hub](assign-robots.md).

Create a schedule within an unattended bot process to view some schedules on the robot calendar. Ensure that one or more active schedules are associated with the robot. For more information, see [Create a schedule within a bot process in RPA Hub](create-schedule-botprocess.md).

Verify that the life-cycle stage of the associated bot process isn’t set to **Retired**.

Role required: sn\_rpa\_fdn.rpa\_release\_manager, sn\_rpa\_fdn.rpa\_business\_user, sn\_rpa\_fdn.rpa\_developer, sn\_rpa\_fdn.rpa\_support\_user, or sn\_rpa\_fdn.rpa\_admin

## About this task

If a robot is associated to multiple bot processes, the landing page of the robot calendar is the schedule view of a published bot process. There can be more than one published bot process associated with a robot.

To view more robot events, add the appropriate **Life Cycle Stage Status** filter in the Robot Calendar.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Robotic Process Automation** &gt; **RPA Hub Workspace**.

2.  Select the list icon \(![List icon.](../image/rpahublist-icon.png)\).

3.  View a robot calendar either from a robot or from a bot process.

**Schedule Timezones**

</td><td>

View the time zones that are defined for the robot, such as, the robot time zone \(workstation time zone\), user profile time zone, and schedule time zone. This field is a drop down list. There can be multiple schedule time zones, based on various schedules defined across different time zones.

 The time zones are sorted alphabetically in ascending order and the user profile time zone is the default time zone.

 The workstation time zone contains the time zone information of the machine on which robot is running.

 The workstation time zone appears in the time zone list only when at least one schedule is defined with the workstation time zone and the robot is connected to the same RPA Hub instance at least once.

 The user profile time zone is defined at the instance level, you can modify it from your profile.

 The schedule time zone is defined in the **Timezone** field while creating a schedule for a bot process.

 The schedule time zone is mapped to the Windows time zone.

 The schedule time zone appears in the time zone list only when at least one active schedule is defined with a specific time zone instead of a workstation time zone.

 If the robot is associated with bot processes that have schedules to be triggered in different time zones, then all those time zones are displayed in the time zone list.

 Along with these scheduled timezones, timezone of current user is also be added to the list. This user profile time zone becomes the default time zone.

 If the robot is associated with a bot process whose schedule has to be triggered based on workstation time zone, then those workstation time zones are displayed in the time zone list.

 The cadence of the events must be based on weekdays that are mentioned in the schedule.

 The events are generated based on the **Start Date** field on the schedule form. For more information, see [Schedule form in RPA Hub](create-robot-schedule.md#).
