# Configuring Now Assist for Creator

To get started using Now Assist for Creator, install Now Assist for Creator. Then turn on the skills, AI agents, or agentic workflows that you want to use.

## Installing Now Assist for Creator

Check your company's entitlements to verify that you have access to Now Assist for Creator. To start using Now Assist for Creator, you must request it from the ServiceNow® Store. Once approval has been granted, you can install it on your instance. See [Install Now Assist for Creator](install-now-assist-for-creator.md) for more information.

## Activating AI capabilities

After installing Now Assist for Creator, you must turn on the AI capabilities that you want to use. Some AI capabilities are turned on by default, such as the Now Assist for Code skills, including code assist summarization, code assist edit, and code assist generation, and code assist autocomplete. Capabilities that aren't on by default must be turned on or activated in order to use them.

You can turn on Now Assist for Creator skills in the Now Assist Admin console. When you turn on a skill, you might have to complete additional configuration steps, such as assigning roles and restrictions for who can access the skill. See the product documentation for the skill that you want to activate for additional configuration steps.

AI agents and agentic workflows are activated in AI Agent Studio. When you activate an AI agent or agentic workflow, you might have to complete additional configuration steps, such as selecting a large language model \(LLM\) for the AI agent or agentic workflow and assigning roles and restrictions. See the product documentation for the AI agent or agentic workflow that you want to activate for additional configuration steps.
