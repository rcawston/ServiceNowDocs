# Generate playbook recommendations

Select the activity definition for a placeholder activity from a list of AI-generated recommendations. The system generates recommendations based on an activity’s name and description.

## Before you begin

-   Make sure the playbook recommendations skill is turned on. To learn how to turn on the recommendations skill for playbooks, see [Turn on Playbook recommendations](turn-on-playbook-recommendations.md).
-   You can only generate recommendations for placeholder activities in a generated playbook outline. To learn how to generate a playbook outline, see [Generate a playbook](generate-a-playbook-outline.md).
-   Role required:
    -   admin, playbook.admin, pd\_author, or a delegated developer permission

## Procedure

1.  In your playbook outline, hover over the placeholder activity and select the recommendations icon \(![Now Recommendations icon](../images/recommendations-icon.png)\) in the mini-picker.

2.  Select one of the recommended activity definitions, if appropriate.

    **Note:** If there are no recommendations listed, then no activity definitions are considered relevant to the activity name and description.

3.  Try updating the **Label** and **Description** to improve results.

    1.  Open the placeholder activity.

    2.  Update the **Label** and **Description**.

    3.  Under the **Activity definition** field, select the recommendations button \(![Recommendations button](../images/now-recommendations-button.png)\) to try to generate recommendations again.

    4.  Select one of the recommended activity definitions, if appropriate.

4.  Continue on with activity configuration from Step [11.e](generate-a-playbook-outline.md#configure-activity-inputs) of the [Generate a playbook](generate-a-playbook-outline.md) procedure.


## Result

When your playbook's trigger conditions are met, your playbook runs. As a result, the system creates a Process Execution record and renders user-facing configurations for Playbook Experience. For an example of how to digitize a manual business process that renders as a playbook, see [Create a sample playbook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/design-automated-process.md).
