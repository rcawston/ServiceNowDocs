## What to do next

-   Set app generation as your preference for creating AI-assisted applications in the ServiceNow Studio user preferences menu. For more information, see [Use the app generation skill to generate apps](sns-app-gen-use-app-gen-skill.md).
-   Grant the now\_assist\_panel\_user role and either the admin or sn\_g\_app\_creator.app\_creator role to each user that you want to create and edit applications using app generation.
-   Users that only need to edit \(not create\) applications using app generation can be granted the delegated\_developer, now\_assist\_panel\_user, and now.assist.creator roles. For more information, see [Delegated development and deployment](../delegated-development-and-deployment/c_DelegatedDevelopment.md).
