# Generate a data binding and formula

Automatically generate a data binding and formula using natural language with correct syntax.

## Before you begin

1.  Install UI Generation application \(28.1 – Zurich or later\). For more information, see [Install UI generation](install-ui-generation.md).
2.  Make sure that you have the ui\_builder\_admin role. For more information, see [Grant UI Builder admin role](grant-ui-builder-admin-role.md).

4.  Select a large language model \(LLM\) provider.

Role required: ui\_builder\_admin

## About this task

Learn to use Data Binding Generation in ServiceNow® UI Builder with Now Assist to automatically generate bindings and formulas. These bindings can be applied to any component property, such as labels, text, lists, or buttons, and can include logic, calculations, or data transformations.

## Procedure

1.  Open UI Builder.

2.  Create an experience or open an existing one.

    For more information, see [Create an experience for UI Builder](../ui-builder/create-experience.md).

3.  Create a page or open an existing one.

    For more information, see [Create a page in UI Builder](../ui-builder/create-page.md).

4.  Create a page variant or open an existing one.

    For more information, see [Create a page variant](../ui-builder/create-variant.md).

5.  Open the Page Editor.

6.  Add a data resource or open an existing one.

    For more information, see [Add and configure data resources to a page](../ui-builder/add-data-resources.md).

7.  From the Data Binding popover, select **Get started**.

8.  You can enter your prompt using natural language or select one from the examples.

    **Note:** For example:

    -   Instead of writing `IF(@context.propers.bare,"bare page","not bare page")`, you can enter `If the page is bare, show 'bare page'; otherwise, show 'not bare page’`.
    -   Instead of `LEN([1,2,3]), ")`, you can enter `How many items are in this list?`

9.  Select the arrow to generate a binding or formula.

10. Review the syntax and output.

11. Select **Accept and Edit**.

12. Apply or reject the binding.

    -   If you’re happy with the output, select **Apply**.
    -   If you’re unhappy with the output, select **Reject** and start over by entering a new prompt.
13. Preview and test the output.
