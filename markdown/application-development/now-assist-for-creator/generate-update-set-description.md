# Generate an update set description

Generate an update set description to quickly communicate the intent and scope of changes.

## Before you begin

You must have the release lifecycle documentation AI agent turned on in AI Agent Studio. For more information, see [Configure release lifecycle documentation AI agent](configure-release-lifecycle-documentation-ai-agent.md).

Update sets must be in certain states for you to generate descriptions using the release lifecycle documentation AI agent. The following table explains what update set locations and states support description generation.

<table id="table_o11_vm4_33c"><thead><tr><th>

Update set location

</th><th>

Required state

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Local update sets

</td><td>

-   In progress
-   Complete

</td></tr><tr><td>

Remote update sets

</td><td>

-   Loaded
-   Reviewed

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>You can’t generate an update set description for an update set marked as the default update set.

Role required: sn\_aia.viewer and update\_set\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to an update set.

    -   To navigate to a local update set, navigate to **All** &gt; **System update sets** &gt; **Local update sets**.
    -   To navigate to a remote update set, navigate to **All** &gt; **System update sets** &gt; **Retrieved update sets**.
2.  Select the update set from the list.

3.  On the update set record page, select **Generate description**.

    **Important:** Each time you generate a description using the release lifecycle documentation AI agent, the operation counts as an assist that is tracked by your Now Assist subscription. To track your Now Assist usage, see [Monitoring Now Assist usage in Subscription Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/monitoring-now-assist-usage.md).

    The release lifecycle documentation AI agent generates the update set description, which might take several minutes. Once a description has been generated, the description is automatically added to the update set record.
