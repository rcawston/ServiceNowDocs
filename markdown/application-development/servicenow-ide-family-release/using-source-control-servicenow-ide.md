</table>## Merge conflicts

If there’s a conflict between local and remote changes in a file, the file is listed under Merge conflicts in the Source Control view \(![Source Control](../image/servicenow-ide-source-control-icon.png)\). You can review conflicts in the editor and resolve them by accepting the current or incoming change, both, or manually editing the file.

## Commit history

The commit history for a branch is listed in the Commits section of the Source Control view \(![Source Control](../image/servicenow-ide-source-control-icon.png)\) and includes details about the commits. To see the commit history for a file, navigate to the File Explorer view \(![File Explorer](../image/servicenow-ide-file-explorer-icon.png)\), select the file, and expand the Timeline section. When you select a commit, a Diff editor comparing the changes opens.

## Repository changes

To update the remote repository an application is connected to, you can use the `Git: Update remote origin` command from the command palette and enter a different remote repository URL.
