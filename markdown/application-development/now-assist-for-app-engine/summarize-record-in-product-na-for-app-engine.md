# Summarize a record in-product using Now Assist for App Engine

Quickly understand the contents of a record in a custom application within Core UI or a custom workspace.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

Verify that the custom app record summarization skill is activated and configured. For more information, see [Activate the custom app record summarization skill](activate-custom-app-record-summarization-na-for-app-engine.md).

The following procedure describes how to summarize a record from a custom application in-product in both Core UI and in a custom workspace. To learn how to add a record summarization card to your custom workspace, see the following resources:

-   [Customize UI Builder pages using components](../ui-builder/work-components.md)
-   [Components documentation for the AI summary card](https://horizon.servicenow.com/workspace/components/now-ai-summary-card?release=zurich)
-   [UI Builder setup documentation for the AI summary card](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/reference/next-experience/zurich/now-components/now-ai-summary-card/uib-setup)

You can also summarize the contents of a record through chat in the Now Assist panel. For more information, see [Summarize a record through chat using Now Assist for App Engine](summarize-record-through-chat-na-for-app-engine.md).

## Procedure

1.  In Core UI or a custom workspace, open the record that you want to summarize.

2.  Select **Summarize**.

    **Note:** Generating and displaying the summary may take several seconds.

3.  When you're finished summarizing a record, you can copy the summary, expand or collapse the summary, or provide feedback about the summary.
