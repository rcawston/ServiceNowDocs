# Source-to-target settings

Allow or deny access of a specific application resource in a source scope to a specific application resource in a target scope.

This setting combination is a one-to-one relationship. For example, you can specify that a specific business rule in source Scope A can access a specific application resource, such as a business rule, table, script include or event, in a target scope.
