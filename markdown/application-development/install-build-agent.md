## About this task

Build Agent is enabled by default to create apps with AI, for example in ServiceNow Studio. To use other Now Assist products, such as the app generation skill, disable Build Agent. For example, using the setting in your ServiceNow Studio preferences. For more information, see [Use the app generation skill to generate apps](now-assist-for-creator/sns-app-gen-use-app-gen-skill.md).

**Note:** The trial app was formerly called "Build Agent" and has been renamed to "Build Agent \(Trial\)."

## Procedure

1.  From the Now Assist for Creator application page on the ServiceNow Store, select **Buy**.

2.  After approval has been granted, on your instance, navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

3.  Using the search bar, search for the Now Assist for Creator application \(sn\_now\_creator\).

4.  Select **Install**.

5.  Enable the Build Agent skill:

    1.  Navigate to **Admin** &gt; **Now Assist Admin**.

    2.  Go to the **Now Assist Skills** tab and select **Creator**.
