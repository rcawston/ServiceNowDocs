# Publish an application to the ServiceNow Store

Publishing an application to the ServiceNow Store makes it available to everyone.

## Before you begin

To publish an application to the ServiceNow Store:

-   Create an application within a private application scope.
-   Join the [Technology Partner Program](https://tpp.servicenow.com/$appstore.do#!/tpp/program).
-   Have the application certified.

**Note:** Applications in the global scope cannot be published to the ServiceNow Store.

Role required: admin, or delegated\_developer with Publish To App Store permission enabled

## About this task

After you have met the prerequisites, you can publish the application to the ServiceNow Store

**Note:**

The **Can Edit Application in Studio** property defaults to true for new applications, but you can set it false before publishing.

In Studio, when an application customization has the **Can Edit Application in Studio** property set to false, the user sees this warning:

4.  Click the **Publish to Store** related link.
