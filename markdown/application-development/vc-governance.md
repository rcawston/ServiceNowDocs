# Governance for vibe coding and AI-assisted app development

Vibe coding and AI-assisted app development on the ServiceNow AI Platform accelerates application development by using AI to generate code and configurations from natural language prompts. However, speed must not compromise security, compliance, and maintainability.

Governance addresses the following:

-   Risk and compliance: AI-generated apps meet enterprise security standards and regulatory requirements.
-   Quality assurance: Automated code is validated through testing and review.
-   Visibility and control: Prevents shadow IT and enforces lifecycle transparency.

ServiceNow embeds security and governance directly into the vibe coding and AI-assisted development workflow, so AI-generated applications meet enterprise standards by default. Build Agent automatically generates Access Control Lists \(ACLs\) that enforce role-based access, validates scripts for security vulnerabilities, and applies code optimization during generation. Every app that's vibe coded and developed with AI on the ServiceNow AI Platform includes audit trails, security controls, and compliance checks without requiring explicit prompts for these features.

**Note:** Build Agent requires the admin role.

## Core governance principles

1.  Approval and oversight:
    -   Use App Engine Management Center \(AEMC\) to approve app ideas and manage collaborators.
    -   Require governance checkpoints before moving from sandbox in Developer Sandboxes to production.
2.  Controlled release management with ReleaseOps implementation practices:
    -   Update sets and update set automation for version control.
    -   Metadata-as-code pipelines for automated deployments.
3.  Secure development practices:
    -   Enforce ACLs and role-based access for generated apps, which Build Agent can do.
    -   Validate AI-generated scripts for security vulnerabilities.
    -   Apply code optimization and review before publishing.
    -   While creating agents and skills, Build Agent asks which users and roles it should operate as, as well as which users are allowed to access the agents or skills.
4.  Support for testing and validation:
    -   Use Automated Test Framework \(ATF\) for functional and regression testing.

        **Note:** If you're using Build Agent, it automatically updates failing metadata to resolve ATF test failures, without you needing to manually run ATF tests.

    -   Include peer review for critical workflows and integrations.
5.  Isolation of work with Developer Sandboxes:
    -   Experiment and develop in Developer Sandboxes to avoid impacting production.
    -   Align with Git-style branching for concurrent development.

## Governance checklist for apps built with AI assistance

1.  App idea approved in AEMC.
2.  ACLs and security roles applied.
3.  Code reviewed and optimized.
4.  ATF tests executed and passed.
5.  Release pipeline validated.
6.  Documentation generated \(such as summaries and flow explainers\).
7.  Compliance and audit logs updated.

## Governance general guidelines

When using vibe coding and AI-assisted development, prompts should not only describe functionality but also embed governance requirements. This helps generated apps comply with security, compliance, and quality standards.

See [Example prompts for vibe coding and AI-assisted development](vibe-coding-example-prompts.md) for example prompts for governance.
