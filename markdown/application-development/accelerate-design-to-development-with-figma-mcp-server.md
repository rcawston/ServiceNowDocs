# MCP connections and Build Agent

MCP connections enable Build Agent to access external tools and resources through standardized communication. Use these connections to integrate third-party applications like Figma for accelerated design-to-development workflows.

The following MCP are currently supported for Build Agent:

-   Figma
-   Linear
-   Prisma

MCP is an open protocol that defines how AI agents communicate with external systems to discover and invoke tools, retrieve resources, and share context. By standardizing this communication layer, MCP allows AI agents to interact with a wide range of third-party applications without requiring custom integration logic for each one.

In Connect Hub, an MCP connector represents a configured connection between ServiceNow and an external system that exposes a server compatible with MCP. Once an MCP connector is set up, AI agents can use it to access the tools and capabilities that the external system provides, enabling coordinated, context-aware workflows across models and systems.

For details on configuring MCP connections in Build Agent, see [Connect Build Agent to a supported MCP server](ba-connct-mcp-server.md).

## Connect to supported MCP servers

Build Agent can use any MCP connection that's available in an instance's registry, though you must manually authenticate the connection the first time you want to use it with Build Agent.

For details on adding a new MCP connection in Workflow Data Fabric, see [Model Context Protocol connectors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/model-context-protocol-connector.md).

An example prompt could be something like the following: `Let's create a new project to track my baby's sleep and create issues in Linear based on inputs from the tracker`.

**Note:** MCP connections are currently available only in the ServiceNow IDE, not ServiceNow Studio.

## Application development with Figma MCP server

Connect the Figma MCP server to the Build Agent to accelerate the transition of your Figma designs to enterprise-grade applications on the ServiceNow AI Platform®.

The Figma MCP \(Model Context Protocol\) server establishes a secure connection between the Build Agent and Figma using OAuth for login authentication. This server enables the Build Agent to access structured design data directly from Figma files, rather than relying on static screen captures. With the available data, the Build Agent can effectively create applications.

The Figma MCP server translates Figma data, such as components, styles, and variables, into a machine-readable format. The Build Agent uses the translated data to generate code, gather design context, or develop design systems directly from Figma. Consequently, developers can create more accurate and consistent application UIs faster than with traditional approaches.

The process of converting Figma designs to applications is as follows:

-   Designers use Figma to create user interface \(UI\) components, styles, and variables.
-   The Figma MCP server employs OAuth to securely access design data from Figma.
-   The Figma MCP server acts as an intermediary, converting Figma’s design data into the Build Agent ’s context.
-   The Build Agent, which is installed on your ServiceNow® instance, receives the translated data and uses it to generate applications.
-   The Build Agent creates applications based on the design data provided by Figma.
