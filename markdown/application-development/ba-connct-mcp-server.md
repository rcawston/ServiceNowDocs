# Connect Build Agent to a supported MCP server

Connect a supported MCP server to Build Agent to access external tools and resources in the chat panel when building and editing apps.

## Before you begin

The MCP connection must be configured before you connect to it in Build Agent. For details on adding a new MCP connection in Workflow Data Fabric, see [Model Context Protocol connectors](../integrate-applications/model-context-protocol-connector.md).

The following MCP are currently supported for Build Agent:

-   Figma
-   Linear
-   Prisma

**Note:** MCP connections are currently available only in the ServiceNow IDE, not ServiceNow Studio.

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **App Development** &gt; **ServiceNow IDE**.

2.  In the Build Agent chat panel, select the Settings icon ![](../image/ba-settings-icon.png).

5.  Select the **Connect** button for the MCP server you want to connect to.

    **Note:** You only need to connect to the MCP server once. After initial connection, the **Connect** button becomes a toggle for each available MCP server.

    The list of available MCP servers is inherited from the instance's registry.

6.  Select **Allow** in the confirmation dialog.


## Result

After Build Agent authenticates the connection, you can chat with it to ask questions related to the MCP server.
