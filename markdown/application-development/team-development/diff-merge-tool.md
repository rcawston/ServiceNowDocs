# Merge tool

The Diff Merge tool enables administrative users to compare differences between two versions of a record.

Administrators can compare field-level changes between two versions, apply changes using Move Right field-level copy functionality and then merge results, or choose to revert to the non-current version. You can access the Diff Merge tool by comparing versions, resolving conflicts, or resolving collisions, during development or after upgrades.

## Accessibility Functions

The platform includes accessibility features that support [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines \(WCAG\) 2.0 level A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/?currentsidebar=%23col_customize&levels=aa%2Caaa) and make the interface accessible to users with disabilities. These features improve the user experience when accessing platform functions with [Using accessibility features](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/keyboard-accessibility.md).

In general, you can use the following set of standard keyboard navigation functions:

-   Press **Tab** to navigate major groupings in a pre-defined sequence, including moving between standard interface controls \(fields and lists\) in a module, or between records within a tab.
-   Press **Shift** **Tab** to move backwards in a pre-defined sequence.

Visually impaired users can navigate the Diff Merge tool. Screen readers can read all critical page content. All links and buttons can be reached when a section that is critical must be read. VoiceOver audible cues describe the content of the section that is necessary to read.

To enable accessibility functions, administrators should set these sys\_properties:

1.  Setting **glide.ui.javascript\_editor** to false makes the following functions accessible:
    -   Script fields \(such as Script Include\).
    -   Side-by-side script comparison.
2.  Setting sys\_properties color settings enables high contrast visibility, which makes the left and right columns more accessible and easier to read by visually impaired users.
    -   **mergetool.bg.left.highlight** - Left column cell color when values differ between versions.
    -   **mergetool.bg.right.highlight** - Right column cell color when values differ between versions.
    -   **mergetool.bg.left** - Left column cell color when version values are the same.
    -   **mergetool.bg.right** - Right column cell color when version values are the same.
