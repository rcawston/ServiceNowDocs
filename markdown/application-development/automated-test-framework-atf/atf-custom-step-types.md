# Creating custom test step configurations

Step configuration records \(or step configs\) define how each step type behaves. You can create new step configurations that define custom steps that run on the server.

When you add a step to an automated test, that step has a defined type such as Set Field Values, or Record Insert. Each step configuration has a number of characteristics that affect how steps of that type behave, including the inputs required, the actions performed, and so on.

These characteristics are defined in the step's step configuration record.

The [Step execution script](atf-config-script.md) field determines the actions the system executes when a step with this config runs.
