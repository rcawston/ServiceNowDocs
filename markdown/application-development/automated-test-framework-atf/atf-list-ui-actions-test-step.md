# List UI actions test steps

Select a UI action from a list to perform different actions on a list or a related list.

You can create a new UI action of the following types. See [Create a UI action](../../platform-administration/t_EditingAUIAction.md) for more information.

-   **List banner button**: Creates a button on the banner of a list.

-   **List bottom button**: Creates a button at the bottom of the list.

-   **List context menu**: Adds an option to the context menu of the list.

-   **List choice**: Adds an option to the list choice at the bottom of the list. You need to select one or more tests to enable the recently added list choice.

-   **List link**: Adds a link to the **Related Links** list.

## Design considerations

-   To use the **Click a List UI Action** test step, the test first needs to navigate to the list or the form with the related list containing the UI action.
-   The **Related list** field appears only when you select Related list as the **List type**.
-   **Action type** is mostly auto-filtered depending on the **List action** chosen.
-   The **Record** field appears only when you select **Single record** for the UI action to be applied.
-   Identify the specific record if you have selected **Single record** to apply the UI action.
-   For the **Timeout** field to appear, select **Page reloaded or redirected** as the **Assert** type.
