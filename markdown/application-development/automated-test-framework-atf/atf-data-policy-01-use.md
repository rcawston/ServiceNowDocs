# Automated Test Framework use case: test a data policy

This use case illustrates testing a data policy with the Automated Test Framework.

## Before you begin

Role required: atf\_test\_admin

## About this task

This example tests the data policy that sets the field **Assignment Group** to **mandatory** if **impact** is **high**.

## Procedure

1.  Impersonate a user with the necessary permissions.

    In this example, the step impersonates an admin user.

2.  Open a form for the table to which this data policy applies.

    This example opens a new incident form.

3.  Check that the data policy has not yet been triggered.

    In this example, the step checks to confirm that **Assignment group** is not **mandatory**.

4.  If applicable, set the conditions that trigger the data policy.

    This example sets **Impact** to **High**.

5.  Validate that the data policy is enforced.

    In this example, the test confirms that the data policy set **Assignment group** to **High** after the previous step set **Impact** to **High**.
