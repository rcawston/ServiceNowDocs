# Create a breakpoint for responsive authoring

Learn how to create custom breakpoints for responsive authoring to control the look and feel of a page at different form factors.

## Before you begin

Role required: ui\_builder\_admin

## About this task

UI Builder currently offers three default form factors:

-   Desktop \(1281 pixels and larger\)
-   Tablet \(1280 pixels and smaller\)
-   Mobile \(500 pixels and smaller\)

Add up to three additional breakpoints. For example, there's a default form factor of 500 pixels and smaller for mobile devices, but you may need a breakpoint of 360 pixels.

**Note:** Custom breakpoints represent a range. If you create a breakpoint at 800 pixels, all changes apply to devices with a width at and lower than the new size. For example, a page opened on a screen 750 pixels wide uses the 800 pixel settings \(properties and styles\) unless there's another custom breakpoint at 750 pixels.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now Experience Framework** &gt; **UI Builder**.

2.  Open an experience to work in or create an experience by selecting **Create &gt; Experience**.

    See [Configure how users interact with your applications in UI Builder](work-experiences.md) for more information on creating experiences.

3.  Open an existing page created from scratch with responsive authoring or create a page from scratch with responsive authoring.

    For more information about how to create a page, see [Create a page in UI Builder](create-page.md).

4.  Select the menu icon next to the three form factor icons.

    The new breakpoint is saved and appears as a form factor icon.

    As you build the page, select any of the form factor icons to view and edit the page at that size.

7.  To edit or delete a custom breakpoint, select the menu icon, point to the breakpoint name, and select the edit or delete icon.

    **Note:** The default form factors \(desktop, tablet, and mobile\) can't be edited or removed.
