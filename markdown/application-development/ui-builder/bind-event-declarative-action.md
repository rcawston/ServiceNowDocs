# Bind an event to a declarative action

Bind data elements within UI Builder so that you can add event actions to a declarative action.

## Before you begin

Role required: ui\_builder\_admin

## About this task

Bind a handled event to a component so that an action is performed when a user selects the component.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now Experience Framework** &gt; **UI Builder**.

2.  Open an experience to work in or create an experience by selecting **Create** &gt; **Experience**.

    For more information, see [Configure how users interact with your applications in UI Builder](work-experiences.md).

3.  Open or create a page.

    For more information about how to create a page in UI Builder, see [Create a page in UI Builder](create-page.md).

4.  Add a component to your page that can have a declarative action, such as an action bar or related list.

    For more information, see [Add and configure components](add-components.md#).

5.  To create a declarative action definition in a table in the ServiceNow AI Platform®, navigate to **Workspace Experience** &gt; **Actions &amp; Components** &gt; **List actions**.

    Choose a table where you want the declarative action to be available in. For example, you could create a Complete my work action in an incident table or you could use an existing declarative action definition record.

6.  Select the **Active** check box, and then save or update the record.

7.  Return to the UI Builder.

8.  To invoke a handled event for the declarative action, go to the Configure panel and click **Configure declarative action event mapping**.

9.  Choose the declarative action that you created earlier.

    To continue with the example in step [5](bind-event-declarative-action.md#step), the declarative action could be something like **Complete my work**.

10. To define what the declarative action does on your page, click **+ Add event handler**.

    1.  Give the event handler a name.

        The name should describe what action you want the event handler to perform.

    2.  Provide a description of the event handler.

    3.  Choose the handled event that you want to invoke.

    4.  Add payload values for your event handler.

    5.  Select **Save**.

11. Select **Done**.

12. Select **Save**, and then select ![Preview button that opens the page variant.](../image/preview-button.png).

13. Test the declarative action on your page by clicking **Complete my work** to see if it works.
