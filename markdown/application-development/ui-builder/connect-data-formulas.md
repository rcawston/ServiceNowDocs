# Connect data to your components with formulas

Bind data exposed by local data resources to components with formulas on your UI Builder page.

## Before you begin

Role required: ui\_builder\_admin

## About this task

Data binding is the process of associating data with a UI element that displays the information. Before binding data to components you must add a data resource to your UI Builder page, see [Add and configure data resources to a page](add-data-resources.md) for more information.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now Experience Framework** &gt; **UI Builder**.

2.  Open an experience to work in or create an experience by selecting **Create** &gt; **Experience**.

    See [Configure how users interact with your applications in UI Builder](work-experiences.md) for more information on creating experiences.

3.  Create or open a page.

4.  Add a data resource to your page.

    For more information, see [Add and configure data resources to a page](add-data-resources.md).

5.  Add a component to your page.

    You need a component on your page before you can bind a data resource to it. For more information, see [Customize UI Builder pages using components](work-components.md).

6.  Select the **Configure** tab from the configuration panel in UI Builder.

7.  Point to a field that you want to bind data to and select the dynamic data binding icon \(![Dynamic data binding icon.](../image/uib-dynamic-data-binding-button.png)\).
