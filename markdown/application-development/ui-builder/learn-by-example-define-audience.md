# Define an audience for your variant

An audience represents a group of users in your organization. You can define who can access this page variant by adding one or more predefined audiences.

## Before you begin

Role required: ui\_builder\_admin

## About this task

In the previous procedure, you created a page variant that can be viewed by anyone accessing a record from the Task table. For this procedure, you will duplicate the variant and configure it so that it is accessible only to audiences with the Admin role.

## Procedure

1.  Open the main page for your demo experience.

2.  Select the experience you created, expand a page and select **Default**.

    ![Demo experience Editor page.](../image/audience-experience-view.png "Demo Experience")

3.  Select the **Open menu** icon.

4.  Select **Duplicate variant**.

5.  On the **Tell us about your variant** screen, enter **Admin only** in the **Name** field.

6.  Select **+ Add** next to **Audiences**, and select the **Admin** audience.
