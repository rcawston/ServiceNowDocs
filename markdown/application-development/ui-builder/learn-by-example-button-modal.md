# Create a button that opens a modal

## Before you begin

    **Note:** When you have selected the component, the Page configuration pane includes some presets you can use to automatically configure components on compatible pages.

10. In the Page content pane, click the plus icon next to **Modals** and select an **Alert** modal.
