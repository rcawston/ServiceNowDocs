# Add modal to component

Learn how to add a modal in UI Builder. A modal is a window that appears when you click a component. For example, a modal might display when a delete button component is clicked, prompting the user to confirm deleting a record.

## Before you begin

Role required: ui\_builder\_admin

## About this task

A modal is a screen that appears when an event handler is triggered by an event such as a button being clicked. The following procedure shows an example of how to add a Confirm modal and an associated event handler to a button component.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now experience framework** &gt; **UI Builder**.

2.  Open an experience to work in or create an experience by selecting **Create** &gt; **Experience**.

    See [Configure how users interact with your applications in UI Builder](work-experiences.md) for more information on creating experiences.

3.  Open or create a page or page variant.

    For more information about how to create a page in UI Builder, see [Create a page in UI Builder](create-page.md).

4.  Add a modal to the page.

    1.  Select the **+** icon in the content tree next to **Modals and popovers**.

        ![Arrow pointing to + next to Modals and popovers line item in content tree.](../image/add-modal-selection.png)

    2.  Choose a modal type such as **Confirm**.

        ![Modal options, with Confirm modal highlighted.](../image/add-modal-options.png)

        |Modal type|Description|
        |----------|-----------|
        |Alert|An Alert modal provides information relating to the component action. For example, when a user presses a delete button, you could have an alert pop-up that lets the user know they cannot undo a delete action.|
        |Confirm|A Confirm modal asks a user to confirm the component action. For example, when a user presses a delete button, the user would have to confirm the deletion of data. You can choose the confirm options from the primary and secondary button label fields, such as Yes/Cancel.|
        |Confirm and destroy|A Confirm and destroy modal is more directive, usually relating to deleting or erasing content. It lets the user know the seriousness of an action, and asks them whether they want to proceed with the action.|
        |Custom|The Custom modal uses layouts to let you fully design what information you want in the modal. Layouts also decide where the information sits within the modal screen. You can use Cascading Style Sheets \(CSS\) styling to change the visual look of the modal, such as background color.|
        |iframe|Use iframe to bring content into your modal using existing iframe content from a URL and data.|
        |Modal viewport|Dynamically pass content into your viewport modal through an event binding using a client script. See [Bind an event to a component](bind-event-component.md) for more information on binding an event to a component.|

    3.  Configure the modals as shown in the table.

        Configure each modal differently, depending on what the modal requires. Change what information goes into the modal, the size of the modal, and how it looks. You can add an event handler to the modal that performs the action for the modal, such as opening or closing the modal.
