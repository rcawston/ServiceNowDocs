# Add an Entity View Action Mapper data resource to a page

Add an Entity View Action Mapper \(EVAM\) data resource to your page in UI Builder so that you can standardize how the data sources in your components are displayed in your cards and lists.

Role required: ui\_builder\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now experience framework** &gt; **UI Builder**.
