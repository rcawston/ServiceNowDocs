# Adjust layout for responsive authoring

When creating pages with responsive authoring for different form factors, learn how to adjust the layout to improve the look and feel of the page at smaller sizes.

## Before you begin

Role required: ui\_builder\_admin

## About this task

A method of increasing page usability is to tailor components by adjusting the layout across breakpoints. There are numerous options for adjusting the layout. In this procedure, adjust the layout of the tabs component for the mobile form factor.

Most column layout options on the property pane can be edited for different form factors. However, the following options have global values across form factors:

-   Number of columns
-   **Stack columns below \(pixels\)** option
-   All options under **Accessibility**

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now Experience Framework** &gt; **UI Builder**.

2.  Open an experience to work in or create an experience by selecting **Create &gt; Experience**.

    See [Configure how users interact with your applications in UI Builder](work-experiences.md) for more information on creating experiences.

3.  Create a page from scratch with responsive authoring.

    For more information about how to create a page, see [Create a page in UI Builder](create-page.md).

4.  At the top, check that the desktop form factor icon is selected.

7.  Add the tabs component.

    1.  Select the **+** icon in the center of the column on the stage.

    2.  On the **Components** tab, find and select the **Tabs** component.

    3.  Select **Save**.

8.  In the configuration panel, on the **Configure** tab, edit the name of the first tab by selecting the edit icon.

10. In **Tab ID**, enter `tab_1`

11. Select **Save**.

    1.  On the **Configure** tab, select **+ Add** next to **Tabs**.

    2.  Select **Start from an empty container** and then select **Next**.

    3.  In **Tab label**, enter `Tab 2`.

16. Select the mobile form factor icon.

    The tabs take more space at the smaller size.

17. Change the layout of the tabs just for the mobile size.

    1.  In the content tree, select **Column 1** under **Column layout 1**.

    2.  On the configuration panel, in **Direction**, select the row icon.
