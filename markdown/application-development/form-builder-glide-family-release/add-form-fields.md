## Procedure

3.  To display a list of the existing fields for the selected table, in the add form elements panel, select **Fields**.

    **Note:** You can also launch the Add form elements panel by selecting the Add \(![Add icon.](../image/fb-add-icon.png)\) icon above any existing element in the form editor.

4.  Customize the fields that display on the selected form view by performing one of the following actions.

    **Note:** Certain field types are only supported in Core UI. Fields are flagged with an exclamation icon \(!\) to indicate an unsupported type.
