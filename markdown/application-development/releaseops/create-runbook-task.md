    2.  Select the playbook that you want the runbook task to occur in, either assessment or release.

4.  Select the playbook stage where you want the runbook task to occur.

    1.  In the **Playbook stage** field, enter the name of the playbook stage or find the available playbook stages using the lookup using list icon.

    2.  Select the playbook stage.

5.  Define when you want the runbook task to occur, either at the beginning or end of the selected playbook stage.
