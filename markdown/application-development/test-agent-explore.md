# Exploring Test Agent

Test Agent autonomously manages end‑to‑end test authoring, execution, and troubleshooting from a single prompt.

## Test Agent overview

By extending Build Agent, Test Agent uses the same prompt and code context to generate unit and functional ATF tests, run the tests, and automatically triage failures.

Test Agent delivers the following measurable outcomes:

-   Build and test together: Author code and generate tests sequentially in a single Build Agent session.
-   Faster failure resolution: Automated root cause analysis and recommended fixes reduce test failure investigation time. When a test fails, Test Agent performs root cause analysis and either automatically applies safe fixes or provides actionable guidance in the chat panel, enabling issue resolution without leaving the ServiceNow IDE.
-   Greater release confidence: Automated tests enforce quality gates and validate code health before promoting to production.
-   Seamless test reuse and execution: All generated ATF tests are stored in the standard sys\_atf\_tests table within the target application scope and can be reused to schedule and run regression tests, just like manually authored ATF tests.

## Test Agent users

AI agents use [role masking](../intelligent-experiences/aia-role-masking.md) to determine which users can access them. Ones installed with Now Assist applications have specific roles that come included with the application. If you select **Users with specific roles** for user access, you must configure the security controls to include these roles. For the instructions to change the security controls, see [Define security controls for an AI agent](../intelligent-experiences/define-sec-controls-aia.md).

Test Agent has the following users.

|Users|Description|
