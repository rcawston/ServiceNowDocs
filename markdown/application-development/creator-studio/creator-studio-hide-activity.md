# Make an activity unavailable in playbooks

Deactivate an activity to stop users from adding it to playbooks in Creator Studio.

## Before you begin

For example, you could hide an base system activity, like sending an email, if it's not relevant to your workflow.

**Note:** Hiding an activity doesn't change anything about the processes using that activity. Hiding an activity only makes it unavailable in Creator Studio.

Role required: admin or app\_engine\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **App Engine** &gt; **Request App Administration** &gt; **Creator Studio Activities**.

    All of the standard Creator Studio activities appear in the list, not just custom activities.

    The Creator Studio Activities table appears.

2.  Open the Creator Studio Activity record for the activity that you want to hide by selecting is **Short Description** field.

3.  Hide the activity by clearing the **Active** check box.
