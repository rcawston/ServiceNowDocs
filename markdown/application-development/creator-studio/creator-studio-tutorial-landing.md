# Creator Studio tutorial

Use this tutorial to create a Gift Card Request app to streamline the processes of providing recognition to a team.

## Tutorial objectives

In this tutorial, you'll assume the following roles to create and deploy the app:

-   As a marketing manager who is looking to streamline the processes of providing recognition to their team, you'll create the Gift Card Request app.
-   As an application development administrator, approve and deploy the new app to a production environment.
-   As a marketing manager, use your live app to submit a recognition request.

## Tutorial scenario

You're a manager with a rapidly expanding team. To date, the team has exceeded its goals every quarter. You want to reward them and provide gift cards as part of that recognition. However, securing approval for monetary awards is an intricate process that can span hours and involve repetitive interaction with many systems and upper management.

To tackle this issue, you check in with the IT admin and confirm that you can create an app to request gift cards. The admin is happy to help you make a new end-to-end app that draws on existing business process knowledge. To enable this, the admin adds you to the Creator Studio Users group in their non-production instance.

**Note:** To complete this tutorial, you must log in to Creator Studio as two different users or impersonate two users: one in the Creator Studio Users group and one admin.

It's time for you to get started on creating a simple app.

## Tutorial part 1: Create the app

Begin by creating an app from the Creator Studio home page.

### Before you begin

Role required: Creator Studio User

### About this task

You can also watch a short video on how to create an app.
