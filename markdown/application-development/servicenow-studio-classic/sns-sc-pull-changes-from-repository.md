# Pull changes from a repository

App developers using ServiceNow Studio can pull changes from a linked Git repository to apply remote changes to the local instance.

## Before you begin

[Link an app to source control in ServiceNow Studio](link-app-to-source-control.md)

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **App Engine** &gt; **ServiceNow Studio**.

2.  In the file navigator, select the application you want to open.

3.  Select **App details** to open the app in the canvas.

4.  Select **Source control** &gt; **Pull from repository**.

5.  Choose whether you want to stash or discard local changes.

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td id="d173693e159">

</td></tr><tr><td id="d173693e168">

**Discard local changes**

</td><td>

Permanently deletes all local changes before switching to an alternate branch. If you choose to discard, you will not be able to recover those files.**Note:** Use caution when discarding local changes. Since all application developers share repository credentials, there is no way to discard just one set of user changes.

6.  Select **Pull from repository**.


## Result

The following operations occur:

-   The ServiceNow AI Platform fetches the most recent changes from the remote repository.
-   The ServiceNow AI Platform applies the remote changes to the instance.
-   The ServiceNow AI Platform identifies any change conflicts requiring resolution.

If there are conflicts, the system displays the **Resolve Conflicts** window.

Delta loading is enabled by default in sys\_properties so your data isn't removed. You can disable this feature if you want data automatically deleted.
