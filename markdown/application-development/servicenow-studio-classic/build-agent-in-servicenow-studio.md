# Build Agent in ServiceNow Studio

Use Build Agent, an autonomous AI agent, to create and update applications in ServiceNow Studio. Build Agent enables developers to perform intelligent, context-aware tasks within ServiceNow Studio through conversational interaction.

For full documentation on Build Agent, see [Build Agent](../build-agent.md). To learn how to develop an application using Build Agent, see [ServiceNow Studio and Build Agent tutorial](sns-ba-tutorial-landing.md).

## Basic Build Agent workflow

The process of using Build Agent in ServiceNow Studio follows a general path.

1.  The Build Agent chat interface opens automatically during a new ServiceNow Studio session. If it's not open already, select **Open Build Agent** from the lower right corner status bar.
2.  Begin a conversation by prompting Build Agent to create or update an application.
3.  Refine your application through conversational interaction, providing feedback and requesting changes as needed.
4.  Roll back changes at any point using checkpoints created by Build Agent.
5.  Deploy the app through update sets, pipelines, or the Application Repository.
6.  Reopen the conversation at any time to make further updates.

For more information, see [AI-assisted ServiceNow AI Platform development with Build Agent](../vc-build-agent-landing.md).

## Key Build Agent capabilities

In ServiceNow Studio, you can use Build Agent to complete the following tasks.

-   Create an app or app file.
-   Update an app or app file.
-   Summarize the contents of an app.
-   Track conversation updates with the conversation change log.
-   Roll back conversations and changes to a checkpoint.
-   Roll back an entire conversation.

Deploying apps created using Build Agent follows the same process as any other app, depending on your company processes. You can deploy using update sets, pipelines, or the Application Repository.

For more information, see [Working with update sets in ServiceNow Studio](working-with-update-sets-in-servicenow-studio.md), [Working with pipelines in ServiceNow Studio](working-with-pipelines-servicenow-studio.md), and [Working with the Application Repository in ServiceNow Studio](working-with-the-app-repo-in-servicenow-studio.md).

## Build Agent chat panel

Use the Build Agent chat panel to create or update an app or app file. Make a selection to begin the chat, or enter a prompt.
