# ServiceNow Studio Navigator panel taxonomy

Learn more about each metadata file type and its corresponding primary table in the File categories tab of the ServiceNow Studio Navigator panel.

**Note:** Any additional extensions of the sys\_metadata table are automatically included in the Navigator panel in the appropriate section.

For each file category, see the file types that you can create and their corresponding primary table. For more information about navigating to a file's primary table, see [Navigate directly to a table in ServiceNow Studio](qs-navigate-directly-to-table.md).

Metadata-specific admin roles are existing roles on the ServiceNow AI Platform that provide developers with admin access to a specific metadata type. For example, a script include admin allows a developer to create, read, update, or delete any script include on the ServiceNow AI Platform and perform development on script includes in ServiceNow Studio. For more information, see [ServiceNow Studio personas and roles](sn-studio-personas-roles.md).

## AI files

AI files provide ways to use generative AI to enhance user productivity and efficiency through conversation and proactive experiences.

**Important:** AI options in the ServiceNow Studio file taxonomy are only available if the AI components have been installed and configured.

</table>## Automation files

Automations provide ways to manage recurring tasks efficiently, with fewer steps, reducing human input and effort. For example, you can configure an email notification to be sent automatically when a record is approved. Create automations to streamline and simplify how you work by adding automations to an app, such as actions, flows, and other automatic tasks.

Flows are automated processes that consist of a trigger and a sequence of reusable actions and flow logic. The trigger specifies when to run the flow. The actions perform a sequence of operations on your data. For example, the Visual Task Boards \(VTB\) Sample Flow creates and assigns a VTB card whenever a priority 1 incident is created.

 For more information, see [Exploring flows](../../build-workflows/workflow-studio/exploring-flows.md).

Assignment Data Lookup

</td><td>

Use assignment data lookups to assign a record automatically using Data Lookup and Record Matching. For example, you can automatically set a value in the assigned\_to and assignment\_group fields for a record when a set of conditions occurs, such as assigning approvals to a group of managers for users below a certain level.

Use a client extension integration to a registered instance of a client extension point that links a UI script with a client extension point. The UI script is included on pages that invoke the client extension point.

 For more information, see [Using extension points to extend application functionality](../../api-reference/web-services/extension-points.md).

</td><td>

sys\_client\_extension\_instance

</td><td>

UI16

</td></tr><tr><td>

Client Extension Point

</td><td>

Client extension points extend the functionality of an application without altering the original application code. Extension points can help prevent your custom code interactions from breaking, which often occurs after an upgrade if you directly embed the custom code into the application code.

 For more information, see [Using extension points to extend application functionality](../../api-reference/web-services/extension-points.md).

</td><td>

sys\_client\_extension\_point

</td><td>

UI16

Client Script

</td><td>

Client scripts enable apps on the ServiceNow AI Platform to run JavaScript on the client \(web browser\) when client-based events occur. For example, it could run when a form loads, after form submission, or when a field changes value.

 For more information, see [Client scripts](../../api-reference/scripts/client-scripts.md).

Many to Many Definition

</td><td>

Use a many to many task to define relationships between different tasks. You can implement one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships. For example, users and roles are a many-to-many relationship because a user can have multiple roles, and multiple users can have any given role.

</table>## Natural Language Understanding \(NLU\) files

Natural Language Understanding \(NLU\) is a model that enables a computer to interpret, analyze, and derive meaning from human language. By creating NLU files, you build and train your application's NLU model to help it recognize user input, or utterances, and determine the corresponding user or system actions.

A system property is a way to store important values for an application, like settings or configurations, that you might need in different scripts. Instead of writing these values directly into the script \(hard-coding\), you can store them as system properties. Creating system properties enables you to update and edit properties in one place, without having to change each script that references the values manually.
