# Legacy - Resolve conflicts

Application developers can choose which application file version to use when applying remote or stashed changes.

## Before you begin

**Important:** Starting with the Xanadu release, the legacy version of ServiceNow Studio is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details on the deprecation process, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

Try building and editing apps in the current version of ServiceNow Studio instead. For more information, see [ServiceNow Studio](servicenow-studio-landing.md).

## About this task

Conflicts occur when there are multiple change versions of the same application file: one set of changes in the remote or stashed version and another set of changes in the local version. Studio requires developers resolve conflicts before applying remote or stashed changes.

## Procedure

1.  From Studio, apply remote or stash changes.

    If the system identifies a conflict, it displays the Resolve Conflicts dialog.

2.  Select how to resolve the conflict.
