# Legacy - ServiceNow Studio

ServiceNow Studio provides an Integrated Development Environment \(IDE\)-like interface for application developers to work on custom applications in one centralized location. It offers a simple way to create, review, and update application files from a tabbed environment.

**Important:** Starting with the Xanadu release, the legacy version of ServiceNow Studio is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details on the deprecation process, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

Try building and editing apps in the current version of ServiceNow Studio instead. For more information, see [ServiceNow Studio](servicenow-studio-landing.md).

The system opens the newServiceNow Studio whenever you edit a custom application.

## Capabilities

-   Create an application and application artifacts.
-   Perform code search.
-   Integrate with source control.
-   Create your company's customizations to store applications that belong to other organizations.
-   Use [Virtual Agent Designer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/conversation-designer-virtual-agent.md) to create and manage topics, which are blueprints for conversations between a virtual agent and a user. You can design topics that help your users resolve common work issues or guide them through self-service tasks.

![Studio User interface displaying the header, application explorer, content frame, and status bar.](../image/studio-ui-istanbul.png "Studio")

With Studio, application developers can:

-   See exactly what files comprise their application in the **Application Explorer**.
-   Add new files to their application using a single **Create Application File** interface.
-   Navigate to files using familiar search-by-name or by-type behavior with the **Go To** dialog.
-   Find code both within and outside an application using the **Code Search** tool.
-   Operate on multiple files at once using the tabbed interface.
-   Operate on multiple applications at once using multiple studio windows.
-   Publish their application to company instances or the ServiceNow Store.
-   View information about their current application from the **Status Bar**.
