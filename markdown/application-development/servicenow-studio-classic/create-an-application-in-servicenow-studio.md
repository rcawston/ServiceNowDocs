# Create an application in ServiceNow Studio

## About this task

You can create apps using the following procedure, or you can use Build Agent to get a head start creating your app. For more information about using a conversational interface to create an app, see [Build Agent in ServiceNow Studio](build-agent-in-servicenow-studio.md).

</table>5.  Enter the basic information for the app on the form.

    ![Enter basic app details](../image/sn-studio-create-scoped-app.png "Create an app basic details")

    1.  Enter a **Name** and **Description** for your application.

    2.  Add a logo by either dragging the image to the **Browse or drag to upload** field or selecting the field, selecting the image from your file directory, and selecting **Open**.

    3.  Specify the **Scope**.

        -   **Scoped** means that the app doesn't interact with any other data on the instance. By default, the app can access and change its own tables and business logic, but other apps can't unless you give them explicit permission.
        -   **Global** means that all tables and business logic on the instance can interact with the app.
        For more information about working with scopes, see [Application scope](../c_ApplicationScope.md).

    4.  Select **Continue**.

6.  Define user access to the app by adding roles.

    ServiceNow Studio automatically defines default admin and user roles. You can remove the predefined roles or add more roles. For more information about roles, see [Managing roles](../../platform-administration/user-administration/ua-creating-roles.md).

    1.  Select **Add a role**.

    2.  Enter the **Role name** and **Description**.

    3.  Repeat this process for as many roles as you need to add.

    4.  Select **Continue**.

    **Note:** You must have at least one role in the application to be able to continue making updates.
