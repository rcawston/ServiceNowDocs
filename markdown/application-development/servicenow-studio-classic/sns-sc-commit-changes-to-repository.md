# Commit changes to a repository

Commit changes made in your application in ServiceNow Studio to a linked Git repository. You can either select a few changes to commit, or commit all changes on the instance at once.

## Before you begin

[Link an app to source control in ServiceNow Studio](link-app-to-source-control.md)

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **App Engine** &gt; **ServiceNow Studio**.

2.  In the file navigator, select the application you want to open.

3.  Select **App details** to open the app in the canvas.

4.  Select **Source control** &gt; **Commit changes**.

    The file changes from all the update sets display. By default, the changes from the current update set display first.

5.  Select the file changes you want to commit.

6.  To include untracked changes, select the **Include changes not tracked via the Customer Update \[sys\_update\_xml\] table** check box.

    -   The default for this check box is set via the **glide.sourcecontrol.default\_commit\_mode** property.
        -   The property can be set to **include\_untracked** or **exclude\_untracked**.
        -   The **include\_untracked** mode commits the updates to the application that do not generate sys\_update\_xml records, as well as any user-selected updates.
        -   The **exclude\_untracked** mode commits only updates selected by the user in the **Select files to commit to source control** modal.
    -   The base system setting for the property is **exclude\_untracked**.
    -   To hide the check box and use the value of the **glide.sourcecontrol.default\_commit\_mode** property, create the **sn\_devstudio.vcs.allow\_commit\_mode\_selection** property and set it to false.
    -   Selecting this check box may incur a performance penalty.
    **Note:**

    Commits always occur in **include\_untracked** mode in the following cases:

    -   Linking to source control for the first time. For more information, see [Link an app to source control in ServiceNow Studio](link-app-to-source-control.md).
    -   Publishing an application that's linked to source control from ServiceNow Studio.
    -   Disabling selective commit mode.
7.  Select **Continue**.

8.  Enter a comment for the changes in the **Commit comment** field.

9.  Select **Commit Files**.


## Result

The following operations occur:

-   The ServiceNow AI Platform identifies all local changes.
-   The ServiceNow AI Platform commits all local changes to the remote repository.

**Note:** For list of known files that don’t have customer update records and are untracked, see [Customer Updates table](../../platform-security/r_CustomerUpdatesTable.md).
