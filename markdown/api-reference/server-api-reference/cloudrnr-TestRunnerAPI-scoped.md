# Cloud Runner TestRunnerApi – Scoped, Global

Manages tests to be executed in a cloud runner for Automated Test Framework \(ATF\). This API is part of the CloudRunnerApi script include.

You can use this API for the following tasks:

-   Start an ATF test or test suite in the Cloud Runner browser.
-   Check the progress of the test job.
-   Cancel the test job.

In global scope, this API is executed within the sn\_atf\_tg namespace. You must have the [ATF Test Generator and Cloud Runner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/atf-test-generator-and-cloud-runner/atf-tg-cr-intro.md) \(sn\_atf\_tg\) plugin activated to use this API.

## TestRunnerApi – cancelJob\(String snboqId\)

Sets the test runner job to complete status and cancels the root trackers of any generated tests that are running.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|snboqId|String|Required. The sys\_id of the BOQ record in the Browser Orchestration Queue \[sn\_atf\_tg\_sn\_boq\] table.|

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|null|Null if successful, error message otherwise.|

The following example shows how to start a test run an ATF test, display the progress, and stop the test run. In the global scope, use the sn\_atf\_tg namespace.

```
var snboqId = CloudRunnerAPI.TestRunnerAPI.startJob({
	"testId": "<sys_id>"
});

gs.info(JSON.stringify(CloudRunnerAPI.TestRunnerAPI.progress({"snboqId": snboqId})));

CloudRunnerAPI.TestRunnerAPI.cancelJob({"snboqId": snboqId});
```

Output:

```
{progress: 64, state: running}
```

## TestRunnerApi – progress\(String snboqId\)

Provides the status of each test ran for a provided Browser Orchestration Queue \(BOQ\) record.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|snboqId|String|Required. The sys\_id of the BOQ record in the Browser Orchestration Queue \[sn\_atf\_tg\_sn\_boq\] table.|

State of the BOQ record.Possible values:

-   Pending – The requested test activity has been created and is waiting to be executed.
-   Processing – The instance is scanning for records to ensure that the execution trackers are marked for cloud runner before the request is sent to the cloud infrastructure.
-   Browsers requested – A request has been sent to the cloud infrastructure to start browsers for test generation or test running.
-   Running – Cloud infrastructure browsers find and execute pending tests.
-   Completed – The test task is complete.
-   Failed state – The test task failed.

If unsuccessful, possible error messages:-   No BOQ ID passed in – The JSON object provided doesn’t have a BOQ ID entry. Verify that the JSON object is structured as `{snboqId: "<sys_id>"}`.
-   Invalid BOQ sys\_id passed in – The ID provided must be for a BOQ record in the Browser Orchestration Queue \[sn\_atf\_tg\_sn\_boq\] table.
