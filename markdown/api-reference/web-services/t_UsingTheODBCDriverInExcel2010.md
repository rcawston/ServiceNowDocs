# Use the ODBC driver in Excel

After installing the ODBC driver and its associated DSN, use it in Excel as a data source provider.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  In Excel, open the **Data** tab.

2.  Under **From Other Sources**, open **From Microsoft Query**.

3.  Select **ServiceNow** as your database \(the default DSN name\).

4.  Clear the **Use the Query Wizard to create/edit queries** check box.

    **Note:** The Excel Query Wizard does not support the listing of columns from a table name that contain an underscore \( \_ \). Clearing this check box uses the Query Builder instead, which supports the use of this character.

8.  Select the table columns that the Query Builder retrieves the data from.

    Use the list above the table or enter the names directly into the columns, and then press **Enter**.

9.  Retrieve the data and create the Excel record by clicking the **Return Data** icon or selecting **File &gt; Return Data to Microsoft Office Excel**.
