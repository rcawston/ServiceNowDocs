# Supported SQL functions

Common SQL functions used in SQL API for querying and analyzing incident data.

ServiceNow supports a variety of SQL functions for querying and analyzing data in tables such as the incident table. This abbreviated list covers common SQL functions organized by category, with sample use cases and queries focused on incident management scenarios.

**Note:** The query engine only supports INNER and LEFT OUTER joins currently.

|Category|Function Name|Sample Use Case|Sample Query|
|--------|-------------|---------------|------------|
|Aggregate Fn|AVG|Calculate average priority level of resolved incidents to measure severity trends|SELECT AVG\(CAST\(priority AS FLOAT\)\) AS avg\_priority\_level FROM incident WHERE state = 7;|
|Aggregate Fn|COUNT|Count total open incidents by priority level|SELECT priority, COUNT \(\*\) AS incident\_count FROM incident WHERE state IN \(1,2,3\) GROUP BY priority;|
|Aggregate Fn|SUM|Calculate total number of updates across all P1 incidents|SELECT SUM\(sys\_mod\_count\) AS total\_updates FROM incident WHERE priority = 1;|
|Aggregate Fn|MAX|Find the highest priority value in open incidents|SELECT MAX\(priority\) AS highest\_priority FROM incident WHERE state IN \(1,2,3\);|
|Clauses|CASE|Categorize incidents by priority for dashboard visualization|SELECT number, CASE WHEN priority = 1 THEN 'Critical' WHEN priority = 2 THEN 'High' WHEN priority = 3 THEN 'Medium' ELSE 'Low' END AS priority\_label FROM incident WHERE state IN \(1,2,3\);|
|Clauses|TOP|Identify top 10 most modified incidents for quality review|SELECT TOP 10 number, sys\_mod\_count FROM incident ORDER BY sys\_mod\_count DESC;|
|Clauses|GROUP BY|Analyze incident volume by category for trending|SELECT category, COUNT\(\*\) AS count FROM incident WHERE state IN \(1,2,3\) GROUP BY category;|
|Clauses|HAVING|Find assignment groups with more than 50 open incidents for capacity planning|SELECT assignment\_group , COUNT\(\*\) AS open\_count FROM incident WHERE state IN \(1,2,3\) GROUP BY assignment\_group HAVING COUNT\(\*\) &gt; 50;|
|Clauses|LEFT JOIN|List incidents with assigned user details for team performance report|SELECT i.number, i.priority, u.name AS assigned\_to, u.department FROM incident i LEFT JOIN sys\_user u ON i.assigned\_to = u.sys\_id WHERE i.state IN \(1,2,3\);|

|Clauses|SUBQUERY \(WHERE\)|Find incidents assigned to active IT Support users|SELECT number, short\_description, assigned\_to FROM incident WHERE assigned\_to IN \(SELECT sys\_id FROM sys\_user WHERE department = 'IT Support' AND active = 1\) AND state IN \(1,2,3\);|
|Clauses|UNION|Combine high priority and unassigned incidents for urgent action list|SELECT number, 'P1-Critical' AS reason, assigned\_to, priority, state FROM incident WHERE priority = 1 AND state IN \(1,2,3\) UNION SELECT number, 'Unassigned' AS reason, assigned\_to, priority, state FROM incident WHERE assigned\_to IS NULL AND state IN \(1,2,3\);|
|DateTime FN|date\_part|Analyze incident creation patterns by year for historical trending|SELECT date\_part\('year', opened\_at\) AS year, COUNT\(\*\) AS incidents FROM incident GROUP BY date\_part\('year', opened\_at\) ORDER BY date\_part\('year', opened\_at\);|

|Numeric FN|ABS|Calculate absolute difference between priority values for normalization|SELECT number, ABS\(priority - 3\) AS priority\_deviation FROM incident WHERE state IN \(1,2,3\);|
|Numeric FN|CEILING|Round up priority division for weighted scoring calculations|SELECT number, priority, CEILING\(CAST\(sys\_mod\_count AS FLOAT\) / 3\) AS update\_score FROM incident WHERE state IN \(1,2,3\);|
