# Activate the Enhanced Web Service Provider - Common plugin

Administrators can activate the Enhanced Web Service Provider - Common plugin to enable unsigned WS-Security requests and specify what authentication requirements SOAP requests have.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  Find the Enhanced Web Service Provider - Common plugin \(com.glide.web\_service\_provider\_v2\) using the filter criteria and search bar.

    You can search for the plugin by its name or ID. If you cannot find a plugin, you might have to request it from ServiceNow personnel.

3.  Select **Install** to start the installation process.

    **Note:** When domain separation and delegated admin are enabled in an instance, the administrative user must be in the **global** domain. Otherwise, the following error appears: `Application installation is unavailable because another operation is running: Plugin Activation for <plugin name>.`

    You will see a message after installation is completed.
