# Outbound REST web service

ServiceNow outbound REST functionality allows you to retrieve, create, update, or delete data on a web services server that supports the REST architecture.

A REST message can be sent by a REST workflow activity or by using the RESTMessageV2 script API. You can run REST messages from a MID Server which allows the message to communicate with REST providers on an internal network.

ServiceNow REST functionality is flexible enough to accommodate many web service APIs. Be sure you are familiar with your web service and the parameters it accepts before attempting to define a REST message in ServiceNow.
