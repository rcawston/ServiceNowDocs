# Use the ODBC driver in Crystal Reports

After installing the ODBC driver and its associated DSN, use it in Crystal Reports as a data source provider.

## About this task

**Note:** Crystal Reports includes the configuration file CRConfig.xml that contains the JVM minimum heap size \(Xms\) and maximum heap size \(Xmx\) values. When configuring the ODBC driver with Crystal Reports, ensure that the ODBC driver uses the same minimum and maximum JVM heap size as Crystal Reports. If these values do not match, update the ODBC driver settings, not the Crystal Reports settings.

## Procedure

1.  Create a new Standard Report.
