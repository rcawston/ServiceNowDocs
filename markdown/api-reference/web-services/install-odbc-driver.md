# Install ServiceNow SQL API ODBC driver on client machine

Install the ServiceNow ODBC driver on your Windows client machine to enable connectivity between your Business Intelligence \(BI\) tools and ServiceNow data through the SQL API.

## Before you begin

-   ServiceNow SQL API ODBC driver can only be installed on a Windows client machine.
-   Verify that JDK 17 is installed on your client machine.

Role required: local administrator on client machine for installation, admin on ServiceNow instance for server-side configuration.

## Procedure

1.  Locate the downloaded ODBC driver installation file on your client machine.

2.  Select and hold \(or right-click\) the appropriate installation file based on your BI tool's architecture \(32-bit or 64-bit\) and select **Run as administrator**.

3.  In the ServiceNow ODBC Driver Setup wizard, review the welcome screen and select **Next**.

4.  Read and accept the End User License Agreement \(EULA\), and then select **Next**.

5.  Select the installation directory or accept the default location, and then select **Next**.

    The default installation path is typically `C:\Program Files\ServiceNow\ODBC`. ![ODBC driver setup wizard-choose destination folder.](../image/sql-api-driver-destination.png)

6.  When prompted for the **Service Name**, enter a name to identify the service \(for example, ServiceNow\_ODBC\) and select **Next**.

7.  When prompted for the **Java Virtual Machine Location**, do the following actions:

    1.  Browse to and select the directory where the `jvm.dll` file is located \(usually `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17\bin\server`\).

    2.  To skip entering the JDK location during installation, select **Next**.

    **Note:**

    You must enter the `jvm.dll` file location for the ServiceNow SQL API ODBC driver to work.

8.  Add the JDK location now or later.

    In the pop-up window,

    -   To enter the JDK location now, select **Yes**.
    -   To enter the JDK location later, select **No**.
    To enter the JDK location later, access the **Management console** as an administrator and navigate to **Services** &gt; **\(Service\_Name\)** &gt; **Service Settings** &gt; **IP Parameters** and enter the `jvm.dll` file location in the `ServiceJVMLocation` property.

9.  When prompted for the **ODBC Data Source** details, specify the following parameters to create an ODBC data source that can be used to create a Data Source Name \(DSN\).

    This DSN will be used to connect your ODBC driver to the ServiceNow instance.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Data Source Name|Short name to identify this data source|
    |Description|Short description of the driver|
    |Service Name|Enter the same **Service Name** as entered in step 6|
    |Service Data Source|This name will be entered in the **Service Data Source** field when setting the **System DSN** in the **ODBC Data Source Administrator** window|

    Usually, the default values are appropriate.

10. Select the **Program Folder** to create links for the driver, and select **Next**.

    ![ODBC driver setup wizard-select program folder to create ODBC driver link.](../image/sql-api-odbc-folder.png)

11. Start copying driver files to the client machine by selecting **Next**.

12. When prompted, select **Finish** and complete the installation.


## Result

The installation creates a ServiceNow SQL API – ODBC folder in the Start menu with these links:

-   **Interactive SQL\(ODBC\)**: An interactive SQL command window for directly testing SQL statements.
-   **Management Console**: A Microsoft MMC snap-in for configuring default properties for the ODBC driver.
-   **ODBC Administrator**: A Microsoft ODBC Administrator program. Searchable by the name **ODBC Data Sources \(32-bit/64-bit\)**.

The ServiceNow ODBC driver is installed on your client machine and registered with the Windows ODBC Data Source Administrator. You can proceed to configure the driver with your ServiceNow instance connection details.

## What to do next

After completing the installation, configure the ODBC driver to connect to your ServiceNow instance. For configuration instructions, see [Configure ServiceNow SQL API ODBC driver on client machine](configure-odbc-driver.md).
