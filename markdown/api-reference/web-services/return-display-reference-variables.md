# Return the display value for reference variables

When you query a record using a **get** or **getRecords** function, the instance returns all fields associated with that record. The fields are often reference fields that contain a sys\_id for a record on another table.

Use one of these options if you want the display value for the field to be returned instead of the sys\_id:

1.  Add the **glide.soap.return\_displayValue** property to your system properties, and every SOAP request will return a display value for a reference field.
2.  Add the **displayvalue=true** parameter to your SOAP request URL, and SOAP requests with that parameter will return a display value for a reference field as a string, instead of the sys\_id. The SOAP URL would look as follows: `https://<instance name>.service-now.com/incident.do?displayvalue=true&SOAP`.
3.  Add the **displayvalue=all** parameter to your SOAP request URL, and SOAP requests with that parameter will return a display value for a reference field, in addition to the sys\_id. The response element name for the display value field will be prefixed with `dv`, such as `dv_caller_id`.
