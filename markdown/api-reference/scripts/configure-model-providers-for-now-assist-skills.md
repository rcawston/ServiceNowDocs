# Configure AI model providers for Now Assist for Code skills

Select a large language model \(LLM\) as the AI service provider for Now Assist for Code skills.

You can use Now LLM Service, Now LLM Long Term Stable models \(LTS\), Azure OpenAI, Google Gemini or Anthropic Claude on AWS as the AI model provider for all Now Assist skills and AI agents. Use the Configuration Controls in [AI Control Tower](../../intelligent-experiences/ai-control-tower/ai-model-providers.md) to define which options are available, then set the skill-level preferences in the [Now Assist Admin console](../../intelligent-experiences/manage-large-language-models.md). For more information, see [Large language models on the ServiceNow AI Platform®](../../intelligent-experiences/servicenow-large-language-model-now-llm/exploring-large-language-models.md).

AI stewards can enable or disable AI model providers in the AI Control Tower. Administrators set the default AI model providers for Now Assist skills in your instance through the Now Assist Admin console. As a user, you can override the instance default AI model provider and select a different model provider for Now Assist for Code skills in the script editor.
