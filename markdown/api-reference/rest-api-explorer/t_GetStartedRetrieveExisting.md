# Retrieve existing incidents

Use a GET request to view existing incident records.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin, web\_service\_admin, or rest\_api\_explorer

## About this task

Use the REST API Explorer to send the following request:

`GET https://instance.service-now.com/api/now/v1/table/incident`

## Procedure

1.  In the top-left of the REST API Explorer, select **Table API** and version **v1**.

2.  Click **Retrieve records from a table \(GET\)**.

    For more information about this API endpoint, see [Table - GET /now/table/\{tableName\}](../rest-apis/c_TableAPI.md#).

3.  In the Path Parameters section, select the **Incident \(incident\)** table.

4.  Scroll to the bottom of the page and click **Send**.

    The response includes incident records from the instance. The REST API Explorer limits queries to 10 records at a time. Only the first 10 incident records appear. The response also includes a Link header that provides the URL to query the next 10 incident records.

    The response also indicates the **Status code** and **Execution time** \(in milliseconds\) of the request.
