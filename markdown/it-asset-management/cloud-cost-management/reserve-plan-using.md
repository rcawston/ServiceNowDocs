</table>**Important:** When you move a resource to the **Accepted Recommendations** or **Declined Recommendations** tab, the Cloud Cost Management application doesn't perform any action. You can change payment plans on the provider management interface.

Google Cloud recommendations are updated periodically and might not show the latest suggestions until the console is manually refreshed. In contrast, Cloud Cost Management fetches recommendations via API, ensuring it has the most current data. This difference can sometimes cause Google Cloud RI recommendations in Cloud Cost Management to diverge from what's shown in the Google Cloud console. A manual refresh is required to see the latest recommendations.

You can also [configure Reservation/Saving plans operations](reserve-plan-using.md#) by selecting **Settings**.

## Configure Reservation/Saving plans operations

Configure Reservation/Saving plans processes and specify the amount of potential savings that triggers notifications.

### Before you begin

Run Discovery on each service account.

Ensure that the Billing Download job has completed for each provider.

Role required: insights\_admin and insights\_owner

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Cloud Cost Management Workspace** &gt; **Operations** &gt; **Recommendations** &gt; **Reservation/Saving plans**.

2.  On the Reserved Instances page, select **Settings**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields:

<table id="table_qnq_v3t_tgb"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Enable Reserved Instance

</td><td>

Option for enabling Reserved Instance activities. Clearing the check box disables Reservation/Saving plans operations.

 Default: Enabled

</td></tr><tr><td>

Notify when potential reserved instance savings exceed \(%\) of total spends

</td><td>

Percentage of overall cloud spends for potential savings on reserved savings that should trigger an email notification to the users or groups that you specify.

 The value is calculated using the amount that could be saved if all the Reservation/Saving plans recommendations are followed.

 The default value of **15** means that notifications are sent only when the savings for potential reserved instances are greater than 15% of total costs.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Do not recommend if savings are below threshold

</td><td>

Minimum cost, as calculated over the Lookback period, to use when deciding whether to recommend a Reservation/Saving plan for a resource.

 For example, a setting of ¥100 means that the app should ignore any Reservation/Saving plan recommendation that would result in less than ¥100 in savings.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Notify groups/Notify users

</td><td>

Users or groups to notify by email when the spend for potential reserved instance savings exceed the specified percentage of overall cloud spend. For information on configuring the email, see [Create an email template](../../platform-administration/t_CreateAnEmailTemplate.md).
