Use the Operations view in the Cloud Cost Management Workspace to view and manage recommendations, cost usage tags, and administration-related operations.

The Operations view includes the following categories of tasks:

-   **Overview**: View your total savings by recommendation type and the number of recommendations to review, which are grouped by their state.
-   **Recommendations**: View the savings of your cloud assets by recommendation type such as Rightsizing, Unused resources, Reservation/Saving plans, and Business hours. Select the recommendation type to view detailed reports and act accordingly:
    -   **Rightsizing**: View the total potential savings by service category, total potential savings by change group, number of resources that are scheduled, completed, declined, failed, and excluded for rightsizing.
