# Configure Business hours operations

You can choose to use or to disable Business Hours features and specify the amount of non-business hour spend that triggers notifications to users or groups. Controlling unnecessary resource use can help reduce costs.

## Before you begin

A cloud account \(parent account\) that has at least one service account and associated datacenters is required.

Role required: insights\_admin \[sn\_clin\_core.insights\_admin\] or insights\_owner \[sn\_clin\_core.insights\_owner\] for owned service accounts.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Cloud Cost Management Workspace** &gt; **Operations** &gt; **Recommendations** &gt; **Business hours**.

2.  Select **Settings**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_qnq_v3t_tgb"><thead><tr><th>

Enable business hours

</td><td>

Option for enabling the Business hours feature. All active policies are applied when data becomes available.

 Deselect the check box to disable the Business hours feature. No policies are applied regardless of the **Active** setting for a policy.

**Note:** When you disable the Business hours feature, all schedules that were applied by policies are deactivated and resources return to their original schedules.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Precedence

</td><td>

The role that should have precedence when policies are applied. Select one of the following:

 -   Admin Policies
-   Owner Policies
 Precedence determines the order in which batches of policies are applied. Each batch is based on the role of the user who created the policy — insights\_admin or insights\_owner. After a match, no other policy is applied to the resource.

 Default: **Admin Policies** \(The set of policies that were created by users with the insights\_admin role.\)
