# Configuring access to CI data on your AWS account

To ensure secure and reliable communications, the Discovery process communicates with your cloud provider accounts and cloud resources through one or more MID Servers. You can set up the MID Servers on your network or in one of your cloud networks.

## Requirements

**Important:** This configuration process applies only if you use the Discovery application to discover cloud resources. Skip this process if you use a different method for discovering resources.

AWS: There must be an internal network connection between the MID Servers and the AWS Cloud API endpoints: \*.amazonaws.com.

## Detailed instructions

See [Setting up AWS service accounts](../../it-operations-management/setup-aws-service-accounts.md).

## MID Server settings for Cloud Cost Management
