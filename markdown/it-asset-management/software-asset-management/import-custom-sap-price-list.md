# Import custom SAP price lists

Import custom SAP price lists into your ServiceNow® instance so that you can track and manage SAP licenses based on the contracts that are specific to your SAP system.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Go to [KB1299127](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1299127) to download the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet template \(imp\_samp\_sap\_custom\_price\_list.xlsx\) that you can use to import custom SAP price list data into your ServiceNow instance.

2.  Fill in the spreadsheet with all the custom SAP price list data that you want to import.

    The **Client**, **System**, and **Price list value** fields are required for every entry on the spreadsheet.

    **Note:** You must fill in a separate spreadsheet for each custom SAP price list that you want to import data for.

3.  From your ServiceNow instance, open the SAP Custom Price List Data \[imp\_samp\_sap\_custom\_price\_list\] table.

    **Note:** The Application Scope of your ServiceNow instance must be set to **Software Asset Management Professional for SAP**.

    1.  On the page header of your ServiceNow instance, select **All**.

    2.  In the menu navigation filter, enter `imp_samp_sap_custom_price_list_list.do`.

        The SAP Custom Price List Data \[imp\_samp\_sap\_custom\_price\_list\] table opens.

</table>6.  Select **Upload**.

7.  On successful upload, select **Preview Imported Data**.

    The Imp Tmpl Imp Samp Sap Custom Price Lists page opens.

8.  Verify that the correct number of entries were uploaded for your custom SAP price list and then select **Complete Import**.

    The data for your custom SAP price list is imported into your ServiceNow instance. The price list is then added to the Price Lists \[samp\_price\_list\] table.

9.  Associate your custom SAP price list with additional SAP named user types.

    By default, the Software Asset Management application automatically associates your custom SAP price list with the SAP named user types that you specified in the imported Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. However, you can associate your price list with additional SAP named user types by adding custom named user types to it.

    1.  On the page header of your ServiceNow instance, select **All**.

    2.  In the menu navigation filter, enter `samp_price_list_list.do`.

        The Price Lists \[samp\_price\_list\] table opens.

    3.  Select your custom SAP price list.

        The Price List record opens.

    4.  In the **Named User Types** related list, select **New**.

    6.  Select **Submit**.
