# SAP USMM-based optimization

Optimize licensing through SAP User License Measurement \(USMM\) rules that map roles to the Named User Type for an SAP client.

The rules in the SAP USMM map roles to a Named User Type on a system client basis. If you want to apply these rules for named user licensing, ServiceNow AI Platform pulls the USMM rules and stores all information in the SAP USMM Rules \[samp\_sap\_usmm\_rule\] table. A scheduled job, **SAM - SAP USMM Based Optimization**, runs weekly to maximize licensing according to the USMM rules of a system client for the discovered user. This optimized Named User Type is populated in the USMM Named user type column in the SAP System Users \[samp\_sap\_system\_user\] table. For more information, see [Tables installed with the SAP publisher pack](component-installed-sap-plugin.md).

If you opt in for the USMM rules by selecting the **Use USMM Role Optimization** check box in the SAP Connection record, the Software Asset Management application prefers the optimized USMM Named User Type during reconciliation. For more information about creating a connection profile to establish a connection between your SAP system and your ServiceNow instance, see [Establish an SAP connection using basic authentication](add-sap-connection.md).
