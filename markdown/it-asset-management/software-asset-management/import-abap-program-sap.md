# Deploy the ABAP program for SAP

To begin establishing a connection between your SAP system and your ServiceNow instance, deploy the Advanced Business Application Programming \(ABAP\) program. Deploying the ABAP program allows data to be shared between SAP and your ServiceNow instance.

## Before you begin

To access the ABAP program, download the SAP ABAP for Software Asset Management application from the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/). Make sure you download the application version that is compatible with the Australia release.

Role required: sam\_admin

## About this task

To deploy the ABAP program, import the transport files that are provided through the SAP ABAP for Software Asset Management application and then configure a service provider with the service-oriented architecture \(SOA\) Manager.

**Note:** If you upgrade your ServiceNow instance, you must download and deploy the version of the ABAP program that is compatible with the new release. You must then reconfigure a service provider with the SOA Manager.

For SAP setup information, see [KB0813999](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0813999).
