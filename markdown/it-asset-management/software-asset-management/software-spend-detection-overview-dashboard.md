# Software Spend Detection Overview dashboard

View all software spend from uploaded financial data in the Software Spend Detection Overview dashboard.

Access the Software Spend Detection dashboard by navigating to **Software Spend Detection** &gt; **Overview**.

Expand a publisher in the left menu bar to see their products. Select a publisher or product to show only those transactions. Select **Edit date range** to filter transactions by date. By default, the dashboard shows all transactions from within the past year. Move your cursor over the Software Spend Over Time graph to view exact spend amounts. You can also view transactions grouped by cost center, department, or location using the tabs at the bottom of the dashboard.

Sharing the dashboard's URL displays your currently selected publisher, product, and date range. To view the applied filters, the URL recipients must already be logged in to their ServiceNow instance.

**Note:** Transactions that aren't labeled with a software publisher aren't included in the dashboard. You can manually update these transactions with a publisher to add them to the dashboard. For more information, see [Manually update transactions](manually-update-transactions.md).
