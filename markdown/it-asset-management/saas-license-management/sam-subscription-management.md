# SaaS License Management

SaaS License Management helps organizations track and control cloud-based applications and service subscriptions as part of Software Asset Management \(SAM\). It promotes ownership, visibility, agility, and accountability, enabling better cost control and efficient use of resources.

## SaaS subscription models

SaaS applications and services are typically subscribed to on a per-user basis. They generally fall into two categories:

-   **Hybrid SaaS**

    Hybrid SaaS combines on-premise installations with cloud-based subscriptions. It’s commonly used by organizations that require offline access to certain applications while also using cloud features for collaboration. This model is also suitable for businesses with compliance requirements that mandate local installations. For example, a Microsoft 365 subscription enables you to access cloud services and install applications like Microsoft Excel on their devices. SAM supports the following Hybrid SaaS integrations:

    -   [Adobe Cloud integration](../software-asset-management/adobe-cloud-integration.md)
    -   [Microsoft 365 integration](../software-asset-management/microsoft-o365.md)
-   **Direct SaaS**

    Direct SaaS refers to applications where all data and functionality are hosted in the cloud and accessed through the internet. You typically log in via a web browser or a dedicated app without installing software locally. For example, a Miro subscriber accesses the application entirely online. This model is common for organizations that prioritize ease of deployment and minimal maintenance, and for teams that work remotely or across multiple locations.

    **Important:** This topic focuses on the Direct SaaS category. It explains how to get started, identifies areas where Direct SaaS can be applied, and outlines ways to use available solutions and workflows effectively.


## Managing Direct SaaS with the SaaS License Management application

Managing Direct SaaS applications can vary based on organizational needs. The best approach depends on factors such as the level of integration required, available APIs, and whether Single Sign-On \(SSO\) is in place.

-   Use [Direct Integration](create-integration-profile.md) when you need deep usage insights and automated license management for supported vendors.
-   Use [SaaS License Connections](saas-license-connections.md) when you want flexibility to connect any SaaS app with a public API and prefer a low-code setup.
-   Use [SSO Integration](saas-sso-integration.md) when you need visibility into apps connected through an SSO provider and want to address SaaS sprawl.

For more information about installing SaaS License Management, see [Request SaaS License Management](request-saas-license-management.md).
