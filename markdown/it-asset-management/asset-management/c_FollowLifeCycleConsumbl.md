# Consumables life cycle

Consumables are assets that are not tracked individually, but as a group of the same model.

The group of consumables has one or more of the following traits.

-   Same location
-   Same state
-   Consumed by the same asset, typically as accessories or parts

Some common consumable assets include mouse devices, computer keyboards, and pencils. The base ServiceNow system includes the **Consumable** model category. The first step in working with models is to create a model within the model category for an individual consumable asset. Items such as monitors, keyboards, and mouse devices are often tracked as consumables. Consumables cannot be pre-allocated.

Consumable assets are stored in the Consumable \[alm\_consumable\] table. Consumables follow a slightly different life cycle from other assets.

## Stages of consumables

The consumable lifecycle stages are as follows.

-   On order
-   In stock
-   In transit
-   Consumed
-   In maintenance
-   Retired
-   Missing
