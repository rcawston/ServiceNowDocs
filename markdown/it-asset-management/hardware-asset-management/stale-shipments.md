# Stale shipments

Shipments that are delayed due to various reasons such as an incorrect tracking number, the loss of a shipment package during transit, and invalid connection details are considered stale shipments.

The ITAM: Process integration profiles and stale shipment job runs daily to check for any stale shipments. A shipment record that is not updated by the carrier even after the integration profile job has run for the maximum wait days for a carrier is marked as stale shipment.

The tracking number of the shipment record that is marked stale isn’t sent to the carrier for further tracking. If you know the reason that a shipment is late, you can decide to continue tracking it. For more information, see [Continue to track delayed shipments](track-delayed-shipments.md).

**Note:** You can view the list of shipments that weren’t updated with the tracking information from the integrated carrier through the Stale shipments important actions card in the Inventory view. For more information, see [Inventory view](inventory-view.md).
