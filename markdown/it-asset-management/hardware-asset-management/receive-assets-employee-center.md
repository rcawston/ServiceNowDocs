# Acknowledge receipt of assets on the Employee Center portal

After receiving hardware or consumable assets that were in transit and reserved for you, confirm their receipt on the Employee Center portal.

## Before you begin

Role required: Log in as an employee.

To view the **My Assets** option on the global header navigation bar of the Employee Center portal, the value of the **enable\_assets** option must be set to **true** on the Additional options, JSON format field of the Employee Center menu record. For more details, see [Enable or disable global header options](../../employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/config-global-header-components.md).

**Note:** The **My Assets** option requires the Hardware Asset Management application to be activated.

## About this task

When an asset reserved for you is in transit, you will receive an email notification with a link to the Employee Center Portal, where you can acknowledge its receipt. You can receive an asset even if the asset is excluded from Hardware Asset Management workflows or if the associated resource category isn't opted in.

## Procedure

1.  View the assets that are reserved for you on the Employee Center portal.

    -   Select the **Receive assets** link in the email notification that you received.

        The link opens the **My Assets** page on the Employee Center portal.

    -   View assets using any of the options available in the global header navigation bar of the Employee Center portal.

</table>    The page displays all the hardware and consumable assets that are assigned to you, in transit, and reserved for you. You can acknowledge the receipt of hardware and consumable assets that are in transit.

**Hardware**

</td><td>

1.  For the hardware asset that you want to receive, select **Receive asset**.
2.  In the Receive asset dialog box, follow any of these steps:
    -   If the **Asset tag** and **Serial number** fields have values, verify them and then select **Submit**.
    -   If either the **Asset tag** or **Serial number** field is empty, enter the value and then select **Submit**.

**Note:** You can only enter values in the empty **Asset tag** or **Serial number** fields if the value of the **sn\_hamp.enable\_asset\_tag\_serial\_number\_edits** system property is set to **true**. This system property can be updated with the admin role.

 -   **Result:**
    -   Asset is received successfully.
    -   Status of the asset changes from **In transit** to **In use**, and the asset is assigned to you.
    -   The **Receive asset** option is no longer available for that asset.
    -   Any receive task associated with that asset is automatically closed.
 **Note:** If the details of the asset that you received don't match the information shown in the Receive Asset dialog box, you can raise an issue by selecting the **Raise issue** option. For more details, see [Raise issue related to your asset on the Employee Center portal](report-asset-issue-attestation.md).

**Consumables**

</td><td>

1.  For the consumable asset that you want to receive, select **Receive asset**.
2.  In the Receive asset dialog box, enter the quantity of consumables that you received in the **Quantity** field.

**Note:** By default, this field displays the consumable quantity that you requested. You can enter a value that is lesser than or equal to the requested quantity, but it must be a positive number and not zero.

3.  Select **Submit**.
 -   **Result:**
    -   If you received the full requested quantity of consumables, then the Status of the asset changes from **In transit** to **Consumed**, and the asset is assigned to you.
    -   If you received only a partial quantity of the requested consumables, the following changes occur:

        -   The status of the assets that you received changes from **In transit** to **Consumed**, and the assets are assigned to you.
        -   The status of the assets that you didn't receive remains **In transit**.
**Note:** Consumed and in transit consumables are displayed separately.
