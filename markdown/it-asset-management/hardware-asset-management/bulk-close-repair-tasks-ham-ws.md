# Bulk close asset repair tasks in the Hardware Asset Workspace

Complete and close multiple repair tasks at one go to process a repair order with multiple repair order lines.

## Before you begin

Role required: asset

## About this task

You can bulk close only similar asset repair tasks that are in the Open state. However, you can't bulk close similar repair tasks for which the task result isn't the same. For example, you can't bulk close two Troubleshoot assets tasks, when one task has a repairable asset and the other has an unrepairable asset.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Hardware Asset Workspace** &gt; **Inventory**.

2.  Select the **Repair orders** tab.

3.  Select a repair order with multiple open repair order lines for which you want to complete the asset repair tasks.

4.  Select the **Repair order lines** tab.

5.  Select the repair order line that you want to complete.

6.  Select the repair task that you want to close.

7.  On the Details form, select the task result.

    -   If you’re completing a Troubleshoot asset task, then select any of the following results in the **Troubleshoot result** field:
        -   **Repairable**
        -   **Unrepairable**
        -   **Redeployable**
    -   If you’re completing a Repair asset task, then select any of the following results in the **Repair result** field:
        -   **Repaired**
        -   **Unrepairable**
        -   **Redeployable**
    -   If you’re completing an Evaluate asset task, then select any of the following results in the **Evaluation result** field:
        -   **Redeployable**
        -   **To be disposed**
8.  Enter notes related to the task in the **Work notes** field.

9.  Select **Save**.

10. Select **Bulk Close**.

    The **Select Assets** dialog box with similar repair tasks is displayed.

11. Select the tasks that you want to close and select **Close Task**.
