    Disputes intake via Virtual Agent rephrases questions from the dispute questionnaire in a conversational format.

    The dispute case is populated with information from the customer's responses. Disputes intake via Virtual Agent infers information from responses to populate other fields as necessary.

4.  If the dispute is for an ACH transaction, the customer may be asked to sign a Written Statement of Unauthorized Debit \(WSUD\), if required.

5.  When presented with the dispute submission disclaimer, select **Yes** to agree.

    If **No** is selected more than once, the user is redirected to a live agent.


## Result

Disputes intake via Virtual Agent creates a Card Disputes Service Case and presents the customer with a reference link.
