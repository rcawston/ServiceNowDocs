## About this task

The customer interaction context summary skill provides a structured, context-aware summary of a customer service interaction in the Interaction page as part of Agentic Contact Center for Banking.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Financial Services Workspace**.

2.  Initiate an interaction.

    -   When a customer initiates a call, select **Accept** in the inbox item.
    -   Manually create a new phone interaction record in the workspace.
    The Interaction page displays.

    The **Relevant details for this call** component generates a contextual summary of the customer's interaction.

3.  After the summary is generated, you can perform additional actions.

**Provide feedback for the summary**

</td><td>

If you think the summary was helpful, select the helpful icon \(![](../../customer-service-management/image/icon-helpful.png)\). If you think the summary wasn't helpful, select the not helpful icon \(![](../../customer-service-management/image/icon-not-helpful.png)\).This feedback improves the generative AI model and can help improve future versions of this skill. The system gathers the feedback on each generated summary and stores it in the generative AI logs \(sys\_generative\_ai\_log\_list.do\).
