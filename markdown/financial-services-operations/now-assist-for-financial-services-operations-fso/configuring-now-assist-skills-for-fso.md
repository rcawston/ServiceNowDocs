## Choosing a language model service provider

Different models can provide different performance and responses. You can choose which service provider to use for your Now Assist for FSO skills and agentic AI.

You can use Now LLM Service, Now LLM Long Term Stable models \(LTS\), Azure OpenAI, Google Gemini or Anthropic Claude on AWS as the AI model provider for all Now Assist skills and AI agents. Use the Configuration Controls in [AI Control Tower](../../intelligent-experiences/ai-control-tower/ai-model-providers.md) to define which options are available, then set the skill-level preferences in the [Now Assist Admin console](../../intelligent-experiences/manage-large-language-models.md). For more information, see [Large language models on the ServiceNow AI Platform®](../../intelligent-experiences/servicenow-large-language-model-now-llm/exploring-large-language-models.md).

**Note:** See [Federal exclusion notice](now-assist-for-financial-services-operations.md#section_yvd_n43_qbc) for more information.

## Configuring ACLs

You can enable security implementation on Now Assist for FSO skills, AI agents, and agentic workflows through access control lists \(ACLs\) and user identities. These ACLs determine which users have permissions to discover and invoke these features.

Configure and manage ACLs for agentic workflows and AI agents in the AI Agent Studio. See [Implement access control in Now Assist AI agents](../../intelligent-experiences/aia-security-implementation.md) for more details.

See [Configure an ACL rule](../../platform-security/access-control/t_CreateAnACLRule.md) for more information on configuring ACLs.
