# Configuring agentic workflows in Financial Services Operations

Activate and modify agentic workflows for Now Assist for FSO in AI Agent Studio.

## Activating agentic workflows

Agentic workflows in FSO are inactive by default. To activate a workflow:

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Agent Studio** &gt; **Create and manage**.
2.  Select the agentic workflow.
3.  In the guided setup, select **Define trigger**.
4.  Select the agentic workflow trigger in the list.
5.  In the Edit trigger form, set **Active** to true.
6.  Select **Save**.

## Modifying agentic workflows

**Important:** By default, all agentic workflows and AI agent records are read only.

To modify an agentic workflow, you must first [duplicate the agentic workflow](../../intelligent-experiences/clone-aia-usecase.md), and then proceed with the following steps:

-   Activate the agentic workflow.
-   Activate the agent within the agentic workflow.
-   Activate the trigger to invoke the agentic workflow automatically.

**Important:** When you modify an agentic workflow, AI agent, or tool, make sure that you update all instructions accordingly.

For more information on activating agentic workflows, triggers, and agents, see [Activate an agentic workflow template](../../intelligent-experiences/activate-aia-use-case.md) and [Modify an AI agent](../../intelligent-experiences/modify-ai-agent.md).

For more information on agentic workflows in FSO, see [Using agentic workflows in Now Assist for Financial Services Operations \(FSO\)](using-ai-agent-use-cases-in-now-assist-for-fso.md).

## Choosing a language model service provider

You can choose which service provider to use for AI agents and agentic workflows [in the Now Assist Admin console](../../intelligent-experiences/edit-model-providers.md).

## Access control lists

AI agent ACLs determine which users have permissions to discover and invoke an agentic workflow or AI agent.

Configure and manage these ACLs for agentic workflows and AI agents in the AI Agent Studio.

Predefined ACLs exist in Now Assist for FSO for the following:

-   Case summarization skills
-   Disputes intake via Virtual Agent
-   AI agents and agentic workflows in Help Resolve Friendly Fraud
-   Subflows used in Disputes intake via Virtual Agent
-   Subflows and subflow actions used in the Help Resolve Friendly Fraud agentic workflow

See [Implement access control in Now Assist AI agents](../../intelligent-experiences/aia-security-implementation.md) for more information.

## Role masking

Required roles: sn\_bom\_credit\_card.dispute\_agent, sn\_bom\_credit\_card.dispute\_agent\_connector.

Agentic workflows and their AI agents use [role masking](../../intelligent-experiences/aia-role-masking.md) to determine which users can access them. Ones installed with Now Assist applications have specific roles that come included with the application. If you select **Users with specific roles** for user access, you must configure the security controls to include these roles. For the instructions to change the security controls, see [Define security controls for an agentic workflow](../../intelligent-experiences/define-sec-controls-aw.md).

In the data access settings, you must also add the necessary roles to Resolve friendly fraud using Agentic AI.
