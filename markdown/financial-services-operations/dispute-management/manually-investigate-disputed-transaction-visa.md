If a merchant refuses a transaction dispute, the case may move to the manual investigation task.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Financial Services Operations** &gt; **Workspace**.

2.  Select the lists icon \(![lists icon](../../../use/reporting/image/inline-data-vis-96px-list.png)\).

    -   For your assigned cases, select **Assigned to me**.
    -   For all dispute cases, select **All**.

8.  Select whether to create a chargeback request in the **Pursue chargeback** drop-down list.

    -   `Yes` - Pursue a chargeback from the merchant.
    -   `No` - Do not pursue chargeback from the merchant.

    The case is submitted to the dispute manager for review and approval when the chargeback eligibility is `No` and the agent sets the **Pursue Chargeback** value to `Yes`. After the manager approves the task, the user agent can continue with the dispute.
