# Set up OAuth for Card Data Security

After you configure your tokenizer service, follow these steps to set up OAuth connectivity with your ServiceNow instance. This connection is required to get file metadata and download URLs from files hosted in the tokenizer service vault.

## Token Authentication in Card Data Security

Card Data Security uses JSON Web Tokens \(JWT\) for authentication. It uses the following token types for authentication:

-   Regular tokens—used for authentication in backend connections.
-   Context-aware tokens—required for user interactions in the UI, such as viewing documents in the data vault.

## Overview of tasks to set up OAuth for Card Data Security

When you set up OAuth for Card Data Security, you will need to set up each connection type below.
