# Investigate stage

The **Investigate** stage of the card dispute playbook, perform tasks such as issuing provisional credit, reviewing participating merchant alerts, and investigating the transaction.

The dispute agent manages disputed transactions through various activities in the transaction playbook. The **Investigate** stage of the card dispute playbook includes the following key activities:

|Activity|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|[Report fraud](report-fraud-visa.md)|Fraud report activity, when the dispute category is **Fraud**.|
|[Issue provisional credit](issue-provisional-credit-visa.md)|Provisional credit for transactions that qualify for IPC.|
|[Determine recovery option for providing final credit](recovery-option-for-final-credit-visa.md)|Recovery options for transactions that qualify for immediate final credit \(IFC\).|
|[Provide immediate final credit](provide-immediate-final-credit-visa.md)|Final credit for transactions qualifying for IFC after setting the recovery option.|
|[Review participating merchant alerts for Visa disputes](alert-merchant-regarding-dispute-visa.md)|Merchant alerts and options **Declined dispute** to proceed or **Accepted dispute** to end the life cycle and move to closure.|
|[Investigate Visa transactions](manually-investigate-disputed-transaction-visa.md)|Transaction investigation and options to pursue chargeback or end the life cycle for the transaction.|

If the chargeback eligibility rules are evaluated as ineligible and **Pursue chargeback** is set to **Yes**, the system triggers an approval request for the dispute manager.
