# Processing a Mastercard dispute

You can view all the transactions of the dispute in the **Processing** stage of the playbook. This stage provides transaction information such as dispute amount, transaction date and time, merchant name, transaction state, current activity, and activity SLA.

After a dispute case is submitted, each disputed transaction is displayed in a **Dispute Workspace**. The dispute transaction progresses through these stages: **Investigate**, **Chargeback**, and **Closure**. As the dispute proceeds, the appropriate stage is updated accordingly. To open a transaction in the **Dispute Workspace**, select the transaction number.

-   Each transaction progresses through a series of steps, during which a corresponding sequence of tasks is generated. The tasks are displayed in **Tasks**.
-   The **Open** tab displays the tasks open along with the SLA and State.
-   The **Short description** provides a preview of the task. Select the task to view its details.
-   The **Closed** tab displays all the tasks that have been closed.
-   The activity stream for the transaction is displayed below the task.
-   The dispute transaction and financial transaction details are displayed in **Disputed transaction details** and **Financial transaction details** widget.
-   The **Attachments** displays files attached to the case. If Card Data Security is installed and configured, **Attachments** in the contextual side panel will handle files differently in transaction records. For more information, see [Manage attachments in Card Data Security](manage-attachments-in-card-data-security.md).

-   **[About Financial adjustments in Mastercard disputes](financial-adjustments.md)**  
Financial adjustments are tasks or activities displayed based on the policy of the transaction. In Mastercard, there are two types of financial adjustments: Financial adjustments 1 and Financial adjustments 2.
-   **[Chargeback in Mastercard transaction disputes](chargeback-stage-mastercard.md)**  
After a chargeback is initiated, the chargeback request is sent to Mastercard, which alerts the merchant. Mastercard requests collaboration from merchants, who either provide a voucher, refund, or First-Party Trust evidence as response. If the merchant doesn’t respond, the process escalates to formal chargeback procedures.
