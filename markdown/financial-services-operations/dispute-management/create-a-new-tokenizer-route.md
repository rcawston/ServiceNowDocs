# Set up tokenized HTTP connection &amp; credential aliases

Configure a connection in Card Data Security using an API key for authentication.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

Define the authentication type when setting up a Service Account in the tokenizer service. API keys are long-lived, whereas JWT bearer tokens are time-limited. The tokenizer service generates an API key after you create a Service Account. For more information, see [Initial setup for Vault schema, Connections and Service Account for Card data security \(KB2830577\)](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2830577).

In ServiceNow, install and set up integrations to the Third-Party Systems \(such as Visa Spoke or Mastercard Spoke\). Card Data Security requires these integrations to function correctly. For more information, see [Integrating with spokes](../spokes.md).

## About this task

You will see records for VROLCardDataSecurity or MastercomCardDataSecurity if Visa Spoke or Mastercard Spoke are installed. These are separate to your existing third-party service connection aliases. Modify these records as required.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Integration Hub** &gt; **Connections &amp; Credentials** &gt; **Connection &amp; Credential Aliases**.

2.  Open the VROLCardDataSecurity or MastercomCardDataSecurity record.

    If you require another third-party connection, create a new Connection &amp; Credential alias. For more information, see [Create a Connection &amp; Credential alias](../../platform-security/connections-and-credentials/connection-alias.md).

3.  In the Related Links section, select **Connections** &gt; **New**.

4.  Follow the steps in [Create an HTTP\(s\) connection](../../platform-security/connections-and-credentials/create-https-connection.md) to create a new credential record for this connection.

5.  Enter the following field value.

    |Tokenizer service authentication method|Credential type|
    |---------------------------------------|---------------|
    |**API key**|API Key Credentials|

6.  In the new record form for the credential, use the API key generated from our tokenizer service.

## What to do next

Repeat these steps for each route you need to set up.
