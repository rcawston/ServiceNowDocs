# Evaluate merchant analysis

Evaluate a merchant's credibility to determine whether the transaction is legitimate or potentially fraudulent before deciding on a resolution.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_bom\_credit\_card.dispute\_agent or sn\_bom\_credit\_card.dispute\_agent\_connector

## About this task

**Note:** When the ACH disputes resolution agentic workflow in Now Assist for FSO is enabled, the Merchant Analysis AI agent is available to assist you at this step. See [Merchant analysis with AI agent](../now-assist-for-financial-services-operations-fso/merchant-analysis-ai.md) for more information.

Ensure that your assignment logic, such as Advanced Work Assignment \(AWA\), is configured so that when a dispute case is assigned to an agent, all associated transactions are automatically assigned to the same agent. This alignment helps maintain consistency and speeds up case resolution.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Financial Services Operations** &gt; **Workspace**.

2.  Select the lists icon \(![lists icon](../../../use/reporting/image/inline-data-vis-96px-list.png)\).

3.  In the **Lists** tab under **Card disputes service cases**, open the case list.

    -   For your assigned cases, select **Assigned to me**.
    -   For all dispute cases, select **All**.
4.  In the list, select which case you want to work on.

    If you want to work on a case that isn't assigned to you yet, you can assign it to yourself by selecting **Assign to me**.

5.  Select the **Playbook** tab.

6.  In the **Processing** tab, select the transaction ID.

7.  In **Open Tasks**, select **Evaluate merchant analysis**.

8.  In **Merchant analysis action**, indicate the final action:

    -   **Credible**: Upon analysis, the merchant is determined to be credible.
    -   **Not Credible**: Upon analysis, the merchant is determined to be not credible.
9.  Close the task.
