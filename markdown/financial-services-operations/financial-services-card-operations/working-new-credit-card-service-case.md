# Setting up a new credit card account

As a credit card agent, you can work on a credit card case to validate the customer information and set up a new credit card account for the customer.

When a customer requests a new credit card, a credit card service case is created and the New Credit Card flow is triggered. This flow triggers the following tasks from the credit card service case. A new task is created when an agent closes the previous task.

1.  [Evaluate the product eligibility for a customer](evaluate-product-eligibility.md).
2.  [Retrieve a credit assessment and evaluate the risks for a customer](retrieve-credit-assessment-evaluate-risk.md).

    **Note:** If the credit assessment agent rejects the credit request, the stage of the associated credit card service case changes to Closed – Rejected. The case is automatically closed and the flow doesn't trigger steps 3–6.

3.  [Check the completeness of the supporting documents for a customer](check-completeness-supporting-documents.md).
4.  [Determine a card's Terms and Conditions and Disclosures for a customer](determine-card-terms-conditions-disclosures.md).
5.  [File a customer agreement for a customer](file-customer-agreement.md).
6.  [Set up a credit card account for a customer and close the case](set-up-credit-card-account.md).

For more information on the flows that are installed with the Financial Services Card Operations application, see [Designer flows for Financial Services Operations applications](../flow-designer-flows-fso-apps.md).
