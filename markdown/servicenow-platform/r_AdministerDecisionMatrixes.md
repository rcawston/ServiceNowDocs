# Decision matrixes

Assessment results obtained by questionnaires and scripted metrics can be mapped to decision matrixes.

Assessment administrators can view and create these dynamically updated graphs, which make it possible to compare assessable records by category. Decision matrixes display data from a trailing twelve month \(TTM\) period.

**Note:** Assessment administrators can access decision matrixes through the Assessment application and vendor managers can access them through the  application.

## Decision matrix components

The decision matrix page has these components:

<table id="table_bkg_m2m_q4"><thead><tr><th>

Options

</td></tr><tr><td>

Filter

</td><td>

Select the subset of assessable records you want to view. The filter options available vary by metric type, based on the **Filter** field and **Filter condition** field settings for each type.![Decision matrix components](../images/DecisionMatrixComponents.png "Decision matrix components")

 The maximum values in the filter are controlled by the **Maximum number of items to show for a decision matrix field filter** property **\(com.snc.assessment.decision\_matrix\_filter\_max\_entries\)**, which has a default value of 1000.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Scale

</td><td>

Select the scale for the decision matrix. The greater the scale, the larger the decision matrix appears.

X- and Y-axes

</td><td>

Each axis represents one or more metric categories. If multiple categories are used for an axis, their respective[weights](c_AssessmentMetrics.md) determine the positioning of the plotted items.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Plotted items

</td><td>

The labeled points you see on a decision matrix, called plotted items, represent averages of [category result](r_CategoryResults.md) data for assessable records. Point to a plotted item label to view a rating summary for that assessable record. Click a plotted item label to view the [scorecard](t_ViewAnAssessmentScorecard.md) for the assessable record.![Vendor decision matrix](../images/VendorDecisionMatrix.png "Vendor decision matrix")

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>## Plotted item rating summaries

If you point to a plotted item label on a decision matrix, a rating summary appears. The summary displays the assessable record's average ratings for each axis. If an axis represents one metric category, the ratings are calculated averages from results for that category. If an axis represents multiple categories, the ratings are calculated averages from weighted results for all of the categories.

The summary shows:

-   Current rating
-   Difference between the current rating and the rating from the previous year
-   Ratings from each previous year, going back three years
