# View a message in a Hermes topic

View the payload of a message in a Hermes topic using the Hermes Messaging Service topic inspector.

## Before you begin

    1.  Select a topic row in the table.

    2.  Retrieve messages from all clusters or a specific cluster using the **Select Data center** drop-down list.

    3.  Retrieve messages received in a specific date range using the **Message start date \(UTC\)** and **Message end date \(UTC\)** fields.

    4.  Search for a specific message in the partition by entering a keyword or regular expression in the **Message body filter** field.

        **Note:** The message filter only supports string searches of text data. You can't search for messages with binary payloads.
