# Tracking message usage in Hermes

Message usage through the Hermes Messaging Service is tracked for monitoring and management purposes through the Kafka topic name.

You access the Hermes Messaging Service exclusively through integrations with other applications, such as Stream Connect and Log Export Service.

You can access Kafka topics in your namespace using the following naming convention:

```
snc.<instance_name>.<namespace>.sn_<app_id>.<topic_name>
```

where:

-   `snc.<instance_name>` is your namespace prefix
-   `<namespace>` is the namespace of the domain your Kafka topic belongs to \(optional\)
-   `sn_<app_id>` is your application ID
-   `<topic_name>` is your unique topic name

**Note:** The full topic name is case-sensitive and limited to 200 characters.

Kafka message usage and licensing impact vary by application. License usage is tracked at the application level.
