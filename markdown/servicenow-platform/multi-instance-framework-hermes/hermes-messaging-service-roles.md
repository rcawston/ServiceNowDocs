### Groups

List of groups this role is assigned to by default.

None.

### Special considerations

Stream Connect administrators with the kafka\_namespace\_admin role can view message data across different domains.

For example, in a Managed Service Provider \(MSP\) instance with Kafka integrations in multiple domains, managing namespace definitions properly is important to maintain separation between domains, so don't grant this role to administrators within a single domain.
