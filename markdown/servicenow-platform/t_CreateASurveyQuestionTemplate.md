# Create a survey question template

You can create and administer question templates.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin or survey\_admin

## About this task

Changes to a survey, such as the modification of question templates, apply to existing survey instances immediately. Templates that you create are available for use with both surveys and assessments.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Survey** &gt; **Templates**.

    Each template is stored as a record on the Assessment Metric Template \[asmt\_template\] table.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  Enter a **Name**.

4.  Right-click the form header and click **Save**.

5.  In the **Assessment Template Definitions** related list, click **New**.

    Create a template definition for each answer option you want to appear on a question.

6.  Complete the form.

<table id="table_kvd_34r_n5"><thead><tr><th>
