# Enable localization for a survey

Enable a survey user to take a survey in multiple languages.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin or survey\_admin

The plugin for the language that you want the survey to be available in should be installed.

**Note:** Localization is applicable only for public surveys.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Survey** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Properties**.

2.  Enable the **Enable/Disable whether to show language picker when a public survey is taken** \(**show\_lang\_picker\_for\_publicsurveys**\) property.

3.  In the System Settings window, from the **Language** list, select the language that you want the survey to be available in.

    **Note:** The **Language** list is available only when a language plugin is installed.

4.  Navigate to **Survey** &gt; **View Surveys** and open a public survey.

5.  Enter the translated text for the survey title, questions, and answers.

6.  Save and publish the survey.

    **Note:** The localization is also applicable in Service Portal if the **Assessment Properties Allow survey link from email to open in service portal view \(applies only for surveys\)** \(**sn\_portal\_surveys.sp\_survey.email\_redirection**\) property is enabled.

    -   The survey is available for survey users in the translated language.
    -   Users can change the language of the survey using the language picker.
