# Create metric types and generate assessable records

Create a metric type, which sets a table and filter conditions that define a set of records to evaluate.

## Before you begin

Role required: assessment\_admin or admin

## About this task

For example, the Vendor Performance application provides the **Vendor** metric type, which defines an assessable record for each source record in the Company \[core\_company\] table that has the **Vendor** field selected. Create a metric type for each set of records you want to evaluate, such as vendors, users within an organization, or projects.

In addition to defining assessable records, metric types also determine how to filter decision matrix data and set the schedule type, which determines whether assessments are on-demand or scheduled.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Assessments** &gt; **Metric Definition** &gt; **Types**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_d34_25r_jp"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

\[Required\] Name of the type. It may be practical to give the type a name that indicates which records it defines.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Assessment duration

</td><td>

Amount of time assessors have to complete their assigned questionnaires, starting from the time the assessment is generated. The assessment duration sets the **Due date** that appears on [assessment instances](c_AssessmentInstances.md). Changes made to the duration of an attestation in the GRC Control Test Definition form are updated dynamically in this field. The default duration is 14 days.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Live feed

</td><td>

Check box that determines whether to enable \(selected\) or disable \(cleared\) the Live Feed view in scorecards for all assessable records created from this type.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Notify manager if overdue

</td><td>

Check box that determines whether to send \(selected\) email notifications a user's manager when that user fails to submit an assigned questionnaire on time.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Assessment manager

</td><td>

Manager for this assessment metric type. These users are responsible only for managing the assessment process and not the results. The system notifies the assessment manager when an assessment for this metric type is past due.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Scoring type

</td><td>

Scoring method to use for questions with a data type of attestation. The possible selections are:-   **Percent**: Attestation score as a weighted percentage of correct answers for scored questions. When you select this scoring type, categories can be scored as **Percent** or **All or nothing**.
-   **All or nothing**: Requires all answers for attestation type questions to be correct, or the score is zero for the entire attestation. When you select this scoring type, all categories are scored automatically as **All or nothing**.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Scale factor

</td><td>

\[Required\] Number to represent the best possible score for assessment results. All results for assessments of this type are scaled to this number. 10 is generally a good scale factor.**Note:** This field becomes read-only when it contains a value and you save the metric type. Choose a scale factor you are satisfied with before you save the metric type.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Pagination setting for Service Portal view

</td><td>

Specify how the user will see pages on the desktop or tablet view in Service Portal.-   **Category**: Display each category on a separate page. The categories appear in the following order:
    -   Each category appears in sequence on a separate page for the first assessable record
    -   Then each category appears in sequence on a separate page for the next assessable record
    -   and so on
-   **Question**: Display each question on a separate page. Questions appear on separate pages for mobile devices regardless of this setting. Each question appears for each category as described for the **Category** setting.
-   **None**: All items on a single page—no pagination
Default: **Category** **Note:** This field appears only when Service Portal is installed.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Roles

</td><td>

Additional user roles that can view the results and access records associated with this type. Users with the specified roles have read access to this type record as well as to associated categories, metrics, assessable records and scorecards, category users, stakeholders, and decision matrixes.**Note:** Users with these roles do not have access to Assessments modules unless they are also assessment administrators. Users with these roles can navigate to the records by other means, such as from reference fields on assessment instances. This field provides the option to easily grant certain users access to specific assessment data in special cases. For example, the **Vendor** metric type provides access to users with the vendor\_manager role so they can view results and compare assessable records when they open scorecards or decision matrixes in the Vendor Performance application.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Signature

</td><td>

\[Optional\] Acknowledgement by a survey recipient of requirements, admonitions, or expectations related to an assessment. For more information, see [Create an assessment signature](t_CreateAnAssessmentSignature.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Return URL

</td><td>

Destination address of a web page that is presented to users after they submit an assessment for this metric type. When a return URL is configured, the end note content does not appear.

</td></tr><tr><td>

State

</td><td>

\[Read-Only\] Status of the assessment: **Draft** or **Published**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Business rule

</td><td>

\[Admin only\] Business rule the system creates to monitor the specified table. When a new record is added to the table that meets the metric type conditions, the business rule generates a corresponding assessable record.If someone changes the table or conditions of the metric type, the system updates the business rule to reflect the changes. Existing assessable records associated with the metric type are not affected.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Schedule type

</td><td>

Setting that determines which assessment process to use. Select **On demand** or **Scheduled**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Scheduled job

</td><td>

\[Admin only\] Scheduled job the system creates to generate assessments for this metric type. This field is populated the first time you save the record. The scheduled job name follows the format &lt;type name&gt; Assessment Creation. Administrators can configure a recurring assessment generation schedule for the metric type.This field is visible only when the schedule type is **Scheduled**.

**Note:** If you change the schedule type from **Scheduled** to **On demand**, the system deletes the scheduled job. If you change the schedule type back to **Scheduled**, the system creates a new scheduled job. The previous assessment generation schedule is not saved, but can be reconfigured if desired.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Evaluation method

</td><td>

\[Admin only\] Indicates the evaluation method for this metric type. The system sets this field based on how the metric type is created. The possible evaluation methods are:-   **Assessment**: Default filter value for metric types. Only this evaluation method uses assessable records, conditions, and stakeholders.
-   **Attestation**: For details, see

[Attestations - Legacy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/policy-and-compliance-management/c_Attestations.md).

-   **Survey**: For details, see [Survey definitions](c_SurveyDefinitions.md).


</td></tr><tr><td>

Scale factor

</td><td>

\[Required\] Number to represent the best possible score for assessment results. All results for assessments of this type are scaled to this number. **10** is generally a good scale factor. **Note:** This field becomes read-only when it contains a value and you save the metric type. Choose a scale factor that you are satisfied with before you save the metric type.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Allow retake

</td><td>

Check box that allows users to modify their answers to a completed assessment, quiz, survey, or attestation. After the due date, the system removes the assessment from the user's My Assessments and Surveys page.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Active

</td><td>

Check box that determines whether the metric type is active. When the metric type is inactive \(cleared\), assessment generation is disabled and users cannot take existing assessments.

</td></tr><tr><td>
