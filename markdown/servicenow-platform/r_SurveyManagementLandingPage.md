# Surveys

Two versions of the application are supported, Surveys, which is the latest version, and Legacy Surveys. Survey improves the user interface and extends the capabilities of the Legacy Surveys application.

Surveys \| Getting started

## Configuring surveys

There are many options for advanced configuration in Surveys:

-   Create a survey, add questions, and choose recipients, all in one interface.
-   Create conditional questions, which appear only when users answer other questions a certain way.
-   Restrict a survey so only specific survey users can take it, and send invitations to those users simultaneously. Alternatively, make the survey a public survey so that any user can take the survey, even anonymous users \(users who have not logged in to the ServiceNow system\).

    **Tip:** The assessment\_take2 UI page should be public for public surveys. If that page is not public, anonymous users do not have access to the page and public surveys do not work.

-   Set a schedule to automatically assign a survey to users and to limit how often the same user can take a survey.
-   Customize the look and feel of survey questionnaires.
-   Save anonymous survey responses.
-   Convert survey responses to numerical scores and view them on scorecards.
-   Deactivate a survey for maintenance or to retire it without deleting it.

**Note:** Because surveys use the same tables and other back-end components as assessments, you may see assessment elements such as table and field names in certain places throughout the survey feature.

## Legacy Surveys

Survey administrators can continue to use legacy survey functionality and data, however, it is recommended that you migrate legacy surveys to the Surveys application. Concurrent use of both survey applications can cause confusion and redundancy.

Survey wizards are not impacted and cannot be migrated.

**Note:** The Legacy Surveys application is not described in the documentation that you are viewing. It is documented on the ServiceNow wiki.
