# Set partition size for AWS API Gateway accounts

You can optimize their performance of AWS API Gateway data sources by setting the partition size in the **PartitionSize** connection property.

## Before you begin

Set the application scope to API Service Graph Connector for AWS API Gateway using the application picker. For more information, see [Application picker](../../application-development/c_ApplicationPicker.md).

Role required: admin

## About this task

The parallel loading feature is available for the following AWS API Gateway data sources:

-   Frontend Backend REST
-   Frontend V2
-   Backend V2
-   Deployment Rest
-   Deployment V2

This feature determines how many Managed APIs execute as parallel jobs to retrieve configuration item \(CI\) data. The partition size specifies how many Managed APIs a single parallel thread evaluates for data retrieval. For example, if you set the **PartitionSize** property to `5` and there are `25` Managed APIs, the application generates `5` parallel jobs during data loading.

**Note:** If the **PartitionSize** property isn't configured, the partition size computation feature of the Integration Commons for CMDB application automatically determines the partition size for parallel loading at runtime. See [Partition size computation for parallel loading in Integration Commons for CMDB](../cmdb-integration-commons/integration-commons-part-size.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Graph Connectors** &gt; **AWS API Gateway** &gt; **Connections**.

2.  From the **Name** column of the Service Graph Connections list, select a connection.

3.  From the **Property** column of the Service Graph Connection Properties related list, select **PartitionSize**.

4.  In the **Value** field, enter a numeric value greater than `0` for the partition size.

5.  Select **Update**.
