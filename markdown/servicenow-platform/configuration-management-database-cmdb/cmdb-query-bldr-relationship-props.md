# Configure the relationships to query on

Configure the type of relationships that you want to query for in CMDB Query Builder. For example, configure which CI on the canvas is the parent and which is the child in the relationship or the level of relationships to query on.

## Before you begin

Role required: cmdb\_query\_builder\_read

## About this task

When you connect CI classes on the canvas, the CMDB Query Builder displays the Connection Properties in the right-side bar, where you can configure the properties of the relationship to query on. For Service Mapping queries, you can also configure whether to query for related or unrelated CIs.

**Note:** Newly added relationships between CI classes might take up to 30 minutes to appear in the relationship list.

## Procedure

1.  While adding CIs to the canvas, select a connection box on a CI and then select the connection box on another CI that you want to create a relationship with.

2.  Configure the relationship properties in the Connection Properties side-bar.
