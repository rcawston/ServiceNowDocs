# Analyzing data integrations for improving Data Foundations

Improve Data Foundations coverage by analyzing existing and suggested data integrations, including Discovery patterns and Service Graph Connectors.

Use the **Data integrations** tab in the CMDB success advisor for Data Foundations to assess the effectiveness of your current data integration sources in the Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\) and identify opportunities to improve coverage across your principal classes. The **Data integrations** tab provides a breakdown of active Discovery patterns and installed Service Graph Connectors, including how many key configuration item \(CI\) attributes each integration source is populating.

For a quick reference to improve Data Foundations coverage, see [Data integration checklist for Data Foundations in CMDB success advisor](cmdb-sa-df-integ-checklist.md).

## Access data integrations

Navigate to the CMDB success advisor landing page, and on the Data Foundations card, select **View insights**. Select the **Data integrations** tab to access integration-related details. For more information, see [Access CMDB success advisor](cmdb-sa-access.md).

**Note:** The CMDB success advisor for Data Foundations dashboard is available only after the setup process is complete. For more information, see [Set up CMDB success advisor for Data Foundations](cmdb-sa-df-config-settings.md).

-   Identify an inactive Discovery pattern that can populate attribute data for your principal classes
-   Identify Service Graph Connectors that cover your principal classes with the highest attribute coverage
-   Detect integration sources that are installed but have no active connections
-   Evaluate which integrations populate ownership, relationship, and infrastructure attributes for CMDB data accuracy
-   Prioritize which integrations to improve to maximize data quality across principal classes
