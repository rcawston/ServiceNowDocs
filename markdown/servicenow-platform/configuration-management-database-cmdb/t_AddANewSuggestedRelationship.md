    3.  In the class navigation bar, click **Suggested Relationships**.

    4.  Click **New**.

    5.  In the Add Suggested Relationship dialog box, select a **Relationship** and a **Target Class** for the relationship. **This Class** and the **Target Class** become parent or child in the suggested relationship, based on your selection of the **Relationship**.

    6.  Click **Save**.
