# Configure API Service Graph Connector for Kong Gateway using SGC Central

Set up scheduled import jobs to pull in Kong Gateway data into your Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\).

## Before you begin

Install API Service Graph Connector for Kong Gateway version 2.0.0 or later from the ServiceNow Store. For ServiceNow Store installation steps, see [Install a ServiceNow Store application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/application-manager/installing-applications-in-application-manager.md).

If setting up the Prometheus connection, enable the Prometheus plugin on Kong Gateway and verify that any required credentials are available. To learn more about the Prometheus plugin, see [Prometheus](https://developer.konghq.com/plugins/prometheus) on the Kong Developer documentation site.

Role required: The following table shows the roles required for each stage of the playbook.

|Stage|Role|
|-----|----|
|Prerequisites|admin|
|Setup|SGC-Admin \(sn\_cmdb\_int\_util.sgc\_admin\) or admin|

**Note:** The admin user role is required to run background scripts and to provide access to global tables to the SGC-Admin user. For information about the user roles for Service Graph Connectors, see [Service Graph Connector user roles](cmdb-sgc-intro.md#section_ett_spp_4hc).

## About this task

The playbook experience for onboarding connectors is activated with SGC Central in the CMDB Workspace. To configure the SGC Central application, see [Configuring SGC Central](../sgcc-configuring.md) and for more information on how to interact with a playbook, see [Interact with Playbook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/playbook-ui.md).

**Note:** Alternatively, you can configure a default connection already available from the installed or draft connections in SGC Central. Go to **All** &gt; **Service Graph Connectors**, then select **Setup** for the connector from the menu. To learn about installed and draft connections, see [Managing connections added for Service Graph Connectors in SGC Central](../sgcc-managing-connection.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **CMDB Workspace**.

2.  In the CMDB Workspace, select **SGC Central**.

3.  On the Overview page, select **Create connection**.

    **Tip:** Alternatively, you can select **Create connection** on the All connections page.

4.  On the Create connection window, select the Kong connector type, and then select **Create connection**.

5.  Complete the initial prerequisites when setting up a connection for the first time using a connector.

    **Note:** This step is required only during the first-time setup. See [Perform initial setup tasks when creating a connection in SGC Central](../sgcc-first-time-setup.md).

6.  Select a template for the authentication type to create a connection.

    1.  In the **Setup** stage of the playbook, select the **Select alias template** activity.

    2.  Select a template type.

        -   **Kong RBAC Authentication**: Select when using token-based authentication.
        -   **Kong Basic Authentication**: Select when using basic authentication.
7.  Enter connection details and test the API connection for importing Kong Gateway data.

    1.  In the **Setup** stage of the playbook, select the **Create and test connection** activity.

    2.  On the form, fill in the fields.

        |Field|Description|
        |:----|:----------|
        |Connection Name|Name to identify the Kong Gateway connection record.|
        |Host Name|Admin URL address of the Kong Admin API server.|
        |Protocol|Protocol used for the connection ensuring secured communication between the client and the Kong server.|
        |Override default port|Port used by the Kong Admin API.|
        |API Key|Authentication secret to connect to the Kong Gateway service. This field appears only when **Kong RBAC Authentication** is selected in the **Select alias template** activity.|
        |User Name|User name required for authenticating requests to the Kong Gateway Admin API. This field appears only when **Kong Basic Authentication** is selected in the **Select alias template** activity.|
        |Password|Password associated with the user name required for authenticating requests. This field appears only when **Kong Basic Authentication** is selected in the **Select alias template** activity.|

    3.  Select **Create and test connection**.

    4.  Once the connection test is complete, select **Continue**.

8.  Set the configuration properties for the connection.

    1.  In the **Setup** stage of the playbook, select the **Set configuration properties** activity.

    2.  In the **Expand HTTP Method Types** field available in the Data retrieval configuration section, enter the HTTP methods including `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, `OPTIONS`, `HEAD`, `CONNECT`, and `TRACE`, to consider for routes.

        For multiple methods, separate them with commas. If left blank, results in a single API Frontend being created with the `ALL` method, indicating support for all standard HTTP methods.

    3.  In the **Exclude workspaces** field available in the Property settings section, enter the workspace that must be excluded from import.

        For multiple workspaces, separate them with commas. For example: `workspace1,workspace2`. If you leave this field empty, the data sources within the connector import data from all the workspaces.

    4.  Select the **Import tags** check box available in the tag settings section, to ingest tags from the Kong Gateway service.

        When selected, specify the key-value pair separator for tags in the **Tags value separator** field. If not selected, tags won't be fetched.

    5.  In the **Tags value separator** field available in the tag settings section, enter the separator for key and value in tags.

        For example, if the tag value separator is set to `=`, the tag `env=prod` is saved with `env` as the key and `prod` as the value.

        If left empty, no tags will be ingested.

    6.  Select the **Collect Usage Data** check box available in the Metric Settings section to enable usage data collection to retrieve API usage data over a specified duration.

    7.  In the **Collection period \(in days\)** field available in the Metric Settings section, enter the duration in days for collecting API usage data.

    8.  Select **Continue**.

9.  Enter Prometheus connection details and test the API connection for importing Kong Gateway metrics data using the Prometheus plugin.

    **Note:** You can skip this step if API usage monitoring with Prometheus isn't required or if you're using an existing Prometheus instance. To skip this step, select **Skip** for the **Create and Test Prometheus Connection** activity.

    1.  In the **Setup** stage of the playbook, select the **Create and Test Prometheus Connection** activity.

    2.  On the form, fill in the fields.

        |Field|Description|
        |:----|:----------|
        |Connection Name|Name to identify the Prometheus connection record.|
        |Connection URL|Base URL of the Prometheus HTTP API, used for fetching metrics.|
        |User Name|User name required for authenticating requests to the Prometheus server.|
        |Password|Password associated with the user name required for authenticating requests to the Prometheus server.|

    3.  Select **Create and test connection**.

    4.  Once the connection test is complete, select **Continue**.

10. Associate the Prometheus connection with a Kong Gateway connection.

    **Note:** You can skip this step if API usage monitoring with Prometheus isn't required. To skip this step, select **Skip** for the **Kong Prometheus Mapping** activity.

    1.  In the **Setup** stage of the playbook, select the **Kong Prometheus Mapping** activity.

    2.  In the **Prometheus Connections** field, search for and select a Prometheus connection to associate.

        You can select the Prometheus connection created in step [9](sgcc-configure-kong-gateway.md#prometheus-connection) or select any existing Prometheus connection during this step. If you skip step [9](sgcc-configure-kong-gateway.md#prometheus-connection), select any existing Prometheus connection.

    3.  Select **Submit**.

    A Prometheus connection can be associated with multiple Kong Gateway connections. You can update the Prometheus mapping in the Kong Gateway connection from the SGC Central view at any time. See [Update a connection for a Service Graph Connector in SGC Central](../sgcc-update-connection.md).

11. Configure the import schedule to import data at regular intervals.

    1.  In the **Setup** stage of the playbook, select the **Configure import schedule** activity.

    2.  Select **Configure import schedule**.

    3.  Expand the Parent scheduled data import within the Import schedules list to select the **SG-Kong Gateway** import schedule associated with your connection.

        **Note:** The connection name is prefixed to the schedule name.

    4.  In the Configure import schedule dialog box, select the **Active** check box, and then fill in the run schedule and time details.

        For more information, see [Schedule a data import](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/system-import-sets/t_ScheduleADataImport.md#table_r53_5hm_xp).

    5.  Select **Save**.

        Alternatively, select **Execute Now** to execute the import schedule immediately.

    6.  Select **Continue**.

12. In the **Setup** stage of the playbook, select the **Confirm connection creation** activity to check whether the connection was configured.
