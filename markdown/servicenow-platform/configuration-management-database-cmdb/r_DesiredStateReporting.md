# Desired State reporting

The Desired State application includes reports to assess your audit results.

These reports are available to all users whose role gives them access to the [Reporting](../../now-intelligence/reporting/reporting-landing-page.md) application. Users with the admin role can share these reports with specific users of groups or change the display options.

Navigate to **Reports** &gt; **View / Run**. In the Reports search field, enter all or part of the report name such as `Desired State`. You can also scroll to the designated category and select one of the reports.

In addition to these reports, you can generate your own reports.
