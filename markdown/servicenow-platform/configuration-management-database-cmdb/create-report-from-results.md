# Create a basic report

After running a query in the CMDB Query Builder, you can create a basic report that is scoped to the query execution.

## Before you begin

The [Core UI plugin](../../platform-user-interface/t_ActivateUI16.md) \(com.glide.ui.ui16\) must be activated.

Role required:

-   View report: cmdb\_query\_builder or cmdb\_query\_builder\_read
-   Create report: cmdb\_query\_builder or cmdb\_query\_builder\_read, and report\_user

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Configuration** and click **CMDB Query Builder**.

2.  Build a query.

3.  In the query results pane, click **Load More Results** or **Load All Results** to load all the results that you want to include in the basic report.

4.  In the query results pane, click the column context menu and select **Bar Chart** or **Pie Chart**.


## Result

The Reports application creates a basic report, which is scoped to the query results that are currently loaded and is static.
