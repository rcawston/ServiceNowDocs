Description

CI creation from assets using IRE

</td><td>

Enables the automatic creation of a CI from an asset record using the CMDB Identification and Reconciliation Engine \(IRE\) for CI classes identified by serial number and without dependent relationships. Requires the relevant business rule to be active for CI creation to occur during asset insertion.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Review reconciliation rules

</td><td>

Evaluates whether reconciliation rules correctly assign attribute ownership to the authoritative integration source for each principal CI class. Helps prevent lower-quality integration sources from overwriting high-quality CI attribute data, maintaining accuracy and consistency across the CMDB.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Review CMDB Data Manager policies

</td><td>

Assesses the configuration of CMDB Data Manager policies, including archive, attestation, certification, delete, and retire, for your principal classes. Each policy type manages a specific life cycle action:-   **Archive**

Archives inactive CIs without deleting them.

-   **Attestation**

Validates CI data or runs automated checks.

-   **Certification**

Verifies CI data for accuracy and readiness.

-   **Delete**

-   **Retire**
