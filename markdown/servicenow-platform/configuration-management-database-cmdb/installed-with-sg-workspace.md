# Components installed with Service Graph Workspace

Several types of components are installed with the activation of the CMDB Workspace \(sn\_cmdb\_ws\) plugin, which includes Service Graph Workspace. This includes properties, tables, user roles, and scheduled jobs.

**Note:** The Application Files table lists the components that are installed with this application. For instructions on how to access this table, see [Find components installed with an application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/find-components.md).

In addition, the CMDB Workspace plugin adds the CMDB Group type 'CMDB Workspace'. For components associated with the CMDB Data Manager, see [Components related to CMDB Data Manager](components-cmdb-data-manager.md).

## Properties installed

The following properties are installed by the Configuration Management \(CMDB\) \(com.snc.cmdb\) plugin which is included in base systems.
