</td></tr><tr><td>

Scheduled job users

</td><td>

User group from which to select the user that scheduled jobs run as, when creating certification and attestation policies. The default value for the **Scheduled job default user** field is DataManager Job Runner which is a member of the default **User group** Data Manager Scheduled Job Users.

 Notifications

</td><td>

Policy types that should receive notifications for approaching due date and for a breached due date.

When either is checked, the system notifies task owners as the due date for incomplete tasks is approaching. Notifications are sent when 50%, 70%, and 90% of the time to due date has passed. On the task due date, a past due notification is sent to the task owner and to the task owner's manager.

 On closing a task, sending notifications stops.

 For information about how the **Days to complete** setting is used to calculate when notifications are sent, see [Create a CMDB Data Manager policy](data-manager-create-policy-wrkspc.md).
