# Relation qualifier

A relation qualifier, which is a CI of the Qualifier \[cmdb\_ci\_qualifier\] type, stores important information about the CI relationships.

In a relation qualifier, you can annotate arbitrary unique information about the relationship between two CIs. You can define multiple qualifiers for a single relationship, resulting in a qualifier chain. But, there can be only a single qualifier chain for a specific relationship type between two CIs.

For example, for a relationship between a parent CI and a child CI, you can add a relation qualifier to note that the relationship was discovered based on traffic \(such as **cmdb\_ci\_qualifier\_traffic\_based\_connection**\). This results in having two records in the CI Relationship \[cmdb\_rel\_ci\] table for the relationship.

-   A record that links the parent CI and the new qualifier
-   A record that links the new qualifier and the child CI

For this relationship, there is a parent CI and a child CI, and a relation qualifier of type **cmdb\_ci\_qualifier\_trafficbased**.

For information about usage of relation qualifiers in the identification process, see [Identification rules](c_IdentificationRules.md).
