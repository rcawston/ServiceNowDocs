# Modify important actions on the Home view of CMDB Workspace

Modify the appearance order and other properties of the important action cards that appear on the Home view of the CMDB Workspace.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cmdb\_admin

## About this task

The task cards that appear in the Important tasks tile on the landing page of the CMDB Workspace, are stored in the CMDB WS Imp Action Card Config \[sn\_cmdb\_ws\_imp\_action\_card\_config\] table. You can edit some attributes of these cards, including the setting that controls whether a specific card appears at all. Cards in the Important actions tile are available only for the CMDB Admin \[sn\_cmdb\_admin\] and the CMDB Editor \[sn\_cmdb\_editor\] user roles and each is configured per one of those roles.

There is some overlap in the task cards that appear for a CMDB Admin and for a CMDB Editor, however, the filters in those task cards are different. Typically, for CMDB Admins, the card filter also includes unassigned tasks that a CMDB Admin needs to assign.

Only editing is possible, you can't add or delete action records in this table.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All**.

2.  In the navigation filter, enter `sn_cmdb_ws_imp_action_card_config.list`.

3.  In the list view of the table, edit the table row that you want to modify or click the row to open the record form.
