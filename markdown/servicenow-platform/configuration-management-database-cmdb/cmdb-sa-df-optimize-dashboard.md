# Manage Data Foundations advisor scope in CMDB success advisor

Manage the scope of your advisor for Data Foundations by editing principal classes in CMDB success advisor to support your targeted Data Foundations outcomes.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cmdb\_admin

## About this task

Control which principal classes are included in your Data Foundations advisor dashboard in CMDB success advisor. You can add or remove entire CI class group or fine-tune the selection by including or excluding specific classes within a group.

For guidance on choosing the right classes, see the [Guidance on designating principal classes in the CMDB \[KB2707240\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB2707240) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

**Note:** Principal classes that are currently in use by CMDB success advisor for HAM can't be edited here. To edit those classes in Data Foundations, you must first remove them from the HAM advisor. See [Manage HAM advisor scope in CMDB success advisor](cmdb-sa-ham-optimize-dashboard.md).
