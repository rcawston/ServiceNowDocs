# Manually create a de-duplication task

Manually create a de-duplication task when it is not automatically created. You can then use the Duplicate CI Remediator or the De-duplication dashboard in CMDB Workspace and in Service Graph Workspace to remediate the manually created task.

In some situations, duplicate CIs are not automatically detected and de-duplication tasks are not automatically generated. Such situation happens with a class for which identification rules are not defined and the identification engine cannot be applied. However, you still want to reconcile these duplicate CIs by utilizing the [Duplicate CI Remediator](reconcile-dup-task.md) or the [De-duplication Dashboard](dedup-ci-exp-cmdb-workspace.md) in CMDB Workspaceor in Service Graph Workspace.

Use the [CMDBDuplicateTaskUtils](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/CMDBDuplicateTaskUtilsAPI.md) API to manually create a de-duplication task in which all duplicate CIs are specified. The de-duplication tasks that you create manually and the automatically created tasks, are stored in the same table \(\[reconcile\_duplicate\_task\]\) and are processed in the same manner.

**Note:** You can manually create a de-duplication task only for CMDB CIs and a CI can be specified as a duplicate CI only in a single de-duplication task.
