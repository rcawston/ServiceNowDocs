# Review CMDB Data Manager tasks

Review Data Manager tasks \(such as life-cycle tasks\) that are assigned to you, to an assignment group that you belong to, to people you manage, or to members of a group that you are the manager of. All in accordance with CMDB Data Manager policies. During the review, you can approve, cancel,reject, or reassign a task.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cmdb\_user, sn\_cmdb\_editor, or sn\_cmdb\_admin

Canceling a life-cycle task is available only for tasks that are in the 'Not started' status, and the required role is data\_manager\_admin or sn\_cmdb\_admin.

## About this task

-   To review attestation tasks, see [Review attestation tasks in CMDB Workspace or in Service Graph Workspace](review-data-manager-attes-task.md).
-   To review certification tasks, see [Review certification tasks](data-certific-review-tasks.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to either workspace:

    -   Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **CMDB Workspace** and then select **My Work** in the CMDB Workspace menu bar.
    -   Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Service Graph Workspace**, in the navigation panel select the Tasks icon, and then, in the Tasks navigation panel, select **Certification**.
    Any attestation tasks that are assigned to you or to assignment groups you belong to, appear in the **Attestation tasks** tab in the My tasks section. Attestation tasks are associated with details such as the due dates and short descriptions for those tasks. Assignment groups that you are a member of, are also listed.

2.  In the My tasks section, select the **All other tasks** tab.

3.  Review the Approval tasks list view and then select the task that you want to process.

4.  Review the task details on the task form.

5.  CMDB administrators can select **Cancel task** if the task isn't needed.

    The canceled task is deleted without any further processing.

6.  Select **Reassign** if the task isn't appropriately assigned, and then select **Assign to me** or **Request reassignment** as appropriate.

7.  Select **Review records** to review the target CIs and records for the task.

    1.  Select any records that you want to exclude for the task and then select **Exclude**.

        The records being excluded for the task are also being added to the exclusion list of the associated policy type. Therefore, these records will be excluded from any future tasks of the associated policy type.

    2.  Select **Reassign** if the task isn't appropriately assigned.

    3.  Select **Reject task** to reject a task, fill in a **Reason for rejection** and then select **Save**.

        You can only reject a task that is assigned to you.

        After you reject a task, the **State** of the task is set to **Closed Canceled** and **Approval** is set to **Rejected**. Also, appropriate notifications are sent to members of the group specified in the **glide.cmdb.data\_manager.rejected.task.notification\_group** system property. For more information about how this property is used for notifications, see [Components related to CMDB Data Manager](components-cmdb-data-manager.md).

    4.  Select **Assign to me** or **Request reassignment** as appropriate.

    5.  Select **Approve task** to trigger the subflow associated with the policy.
