# Review de-duplication tasks \(manual\)

Review details of de-duplication tasks which remediate duplicate CIs, and then potentially process a de-duplication task.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cmdb\_editor or itil to view, and sn\_cmdb\_admin, itil\_admin, or cmdb\_dedup\_admin to remediate a de-duplication task.

## About this task

Alternatively, you can use de-duplication capabilities in CMDB Workspaceor in Service Graph Workspace. Use the De-duplication dashboard and the De-duplication Template Library to:

-   Review de-duplication tasks
-   Process de-duplication tasks in bulk by using de-duplication templates
-   Gain insights into de-duplication counts and status in your organization

For more information, see [CI de-duplication experience in CMDB Workspace and in Service Graph Workspace](dedup-ci-exp-cmdb-workspace.md).

If a duplicate CI is a dependent CI, then you can view the details of the dependent relationship, the Depend on CI, and any relation qualifier chain. If the dependent CI has a lookup table, then you can see the details of the respective lookup table.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Configuration** &gt; **Identification/Reconciliation** &gt; **De-duplication Tasks**.
