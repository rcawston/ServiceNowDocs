-   **Records added**

    Total number of records that were inserted into the system on the previous day, as recorded in the sn\_cmdb\_int\_util\_cmdb\_integration\_execution\_audit table. The score is calculated by counting the number of records updated on the specified day, based on operations that were marked as inserted in the audit log.

-   **Records updated**

    Total number of records that were updated in the system on the previous day, as recorded in the sn\_cmdb\_int\_util\_cmdb\_integration\_execution\_audit table. The score is calculated by counting the number of records updated on the specified day, based on operations that were marked as Updated in the audit log.

-   **Records added or updated**

    Total number of records that were added or updated in the system on the previous day, as recorded in the sn\_cmdb\_int\_util\_cmdb\_integration\_execution\_audit table. The score is calculated by counting the number of records inserted or updated on the specified day, based on operations that were marked as Inserted or Updated in the audit log.

-   **Errors**

    Total number of errors categorized under credentials, data source, or connection issues that occurred during integration executions on the previous day, as recorded in the sn\_cmdb\_int\_util\_cmdb\_integration\_execution\_error table. The score is calculated by counting the number of errors on the specified day.

-   **SGC.processing.errors**

    Number of processing errors categorized under data source issues that occurred during integration executions on the previous day, as recorded in the sn\_cmdb\_int\_util\_cmdb\_integration\_execution\_error table. The score is calculated by counting the number of errors on the specified day.

    Total number of import sets that were completed successfully during their transformation process on the previous day, as recorded in the sn\_cmdb\_int\_util\_cmdb\_integration\_execution\_import\_set table. The score is calculated according to this formula: `Count of import sets with Errors = 0`.

-   **SGC.Fully.error.ImportSet**

    Total number of import sets that completed with errors during their transformation process on the previous day, as recorded in the sn\_cmdb\_int\_util\_cmdb\_integration\_execution\_import\_set table. The score is calculated according to this formula: `Count of import sets with Errors ≠ 0 and Rows = Errors`.

-   **SGC.Part.success.ImportSet**

    Total number of import sets that completed with some errors where the number of rows processed differs from the number of errors reported on the previous day, as recorded in the sn\_cmdb\_int\_util\_cmdb\_integration\_execution\_import\_set table. The score is calculated according to this formula: `Count of import sets with Errors ≠ 0 and Rows ≠ Errors`.

-   **SGC.Integrations.Importset.rows.ingested**

    Total number of rows ingested for the import sets on the previous day, as recorded in the sn\_cmdb\_int\_util\_cmdb\_integration\_execution table. The score is calculated according to this formula: `Sum of rows ingested`.

-   **SGC.Integrations.Processing Rate**

    Average processing rate of import sets based on the total number of rows processed and the total processing time \(in hours\) for the import sets that either completed successfully or encountered errors on the previous day, as recorded in the sn\_cmdb\_int\_util\_cmdb\_integration\_execution table. The score is calculated according to this formula: `Sum of rows processed​/Total time (in hours)`.
