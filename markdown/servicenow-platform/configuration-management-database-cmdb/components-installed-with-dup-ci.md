# Components installed for duplicate CI remediation

Tables installed to support duplicate CI remediation \(included in the com.snc.cmdb plugin\).

## Tables installed

<table id="table_fbz_45z_vdb"><thead><tr><th>

Remediate Duplicate Task\[reconcile\_duplicate\_task\]

</td><td>

De-duplication tasks.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Duplicate Audit Result\[duplicate\_audit\_result\]

</td><td>

CIs associated with each de-duplication task.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Duplicate CI Remediation\[cmdb\_duplicate\_ci\_remediation\]

</td><td>

Input, selections on each tab, overall status of remediation, and results of each run of the Duplicate CI Remediator.

</td></tr><tr><td>

CMDB Workspace De-duplication template library\[sn\_cmdb\_ws\_reconcile\_duplicate\_template\_library\]

</td><td>

Library names and their descriptions.

</td></tr><tr><td>

De-duplication template suggested task\[sn\_cmdb\_ws\_reconcile\_duplicate\_template\_suggested\_task\]

</td><td>

Mappings of de-duplication tasks to templates.

</td></tr><tr><td>

De-duplication Related Table Configurations\[reconcile\_duplicate\_related\_table\_config\]

</td><td>

Settings per related table \(table that references CIs\) to disable workflows \(for example, skip business rules\) and/or ignore database errors during remediation. Disabling workflows such as skipping those business rules, that block the update of referenced CIs to the main CI, allows de-duplication tasks that otherwise fail, to complete.

 In the base system, this table contains records for the Change \[change\_request\] and the Task CI \[task\_ci\] related tables, which are configured to disable workflow and to proceed with errors.

 For more information about how to use this table, see [Turn off workflows of related tables during remediation](dedup-ci-disable-workflow.md).

Description

De-duplication: Populate Duplicate Task Data

</td><td>

Runs daily to copy metadata, such as the identification attributes and identification rules used in generating a de-duplication task, into an easily accessible table. The metadata is stored in the Reconcile Duplicate Task Data \[reconcile\_duplicate\_task\_data\] table and used for analytics for the De-duplication dashboard.

</td></tr><tr><td>

De-duplication: Populate Template Task Run Records

</td><td>

Runs every minute to evaluate the de-duplication tasks applicable for a template according to your settings. Based on settings, assigns matching tasks and manually added tasks to the template for remediation.

 De-duplication tasks are remediated after you select **Run template**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

De-Duplication: Template Scheduler

</td><td>

Runs every minute by the template scheduler to check the capacity of the execution engine. If there is available capacity, picks any new de-duplication tasks added to the queue, for remediation.

 De-duplication tasks aren't remediated and remain in ready state unless this job runs periodically.

</td></tr><tr><td>

De-duplication: Populate Template Suggested and Orphan Tasks

</td><td>

Runs hourly to count the number of tasks that match each published template and the number of tasks that don’t match any published template. These counts then appear on various cards in the De-duplication dashboard.
