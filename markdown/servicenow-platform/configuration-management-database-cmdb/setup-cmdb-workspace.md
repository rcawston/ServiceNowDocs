# Set up CMDB Workspace

Set up and access the CMDB Workspace store app.

## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/store-release-notes/page/release-notes/store/sn-store-release-notes.html).

**Note:** The CMDB Workspace store app is automatically installed when installing or upgrading the product.

## Enable demo data

Enable demo data to install demo data-specific scheduled jobs that if the needed requirement is met, generates and populates demo data in CMDB Workspace cards such as:

-   Cloud vs Non-cloud resources chart in the CMDB Workspace landing page and the Insights view: If Cloud Service Accounts \[cmdb\_ci\_cloud\_service\_account\] table exists
-   Cards in the CMDB 360 view: If CMDB 360 is enabled
-   Cards in the Insights view, CMDB Feature Adoption tile:
    -   CIs processed by IRE
    -   CIs processed by IRE based on source
    -   Data Manager
    -   Data attestation
    -   Query Builder
    -   Intelligent Search
-   Cards in the What's new tile in the CMDB Workspace landing page.

To populate CMDB Workspace dashboards with demo data:

1.  When installing the CMDB Workspace store app, check **Load demo data**.
2.  Access the **\[Demo\] — CMDB Workspace demo data** scheduled job and select **Execute Now**.

**Note:** As a general practice, don't enable demo data in a production instance to prevent demo data mixing with real production data.

-   Roles: To access the CMDB Workspace, you must, at a minimum, have one of the following roles, which are essential for interacting with the CMDB Workspace. Depending on which of these roles is assigned to you, you might only have access to some of the features available in the CMDB Workspace:

    -   sn\_cmdb\_admin
    -   sn\_cmdb\_editor
