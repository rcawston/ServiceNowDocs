# Configure API Service Graph Connector for Azure API Management using SGC Central

Set up scheduled import jobs to pull in Azure API Management data into your CMDB.

## Before you begin

Install API Service Graph Connector for Azure API Management version 1.0.0 or later from the ServiceNow Store. For ServiceNow Store installation steps, see [Install a ServiceNow Store application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/application-manager/installing-applications-in-application-manager.md).

Obtain the OAuth credentials from your Azure administrator. Make a note of the following details:

-   Application \(client\) ID
-   Client Secret
-   Directory \(tenant\) ID
-   Connection URL

Role required: The following table shows the roles required for each stage of the playbook.

|Stage|Role|
|-----|----|
|Prerequisites|admin|
|Setup|SGC-Admin \(sn\_cmdb\_int\_util.sgc\_admin\) or admin|

**Note:** The admin user role is required to run background scripts and to provide access to global tables to the SGC-Admin user. For information about the user roles for Service Graph Connectors, see [Service Graph Connector user roles](cmdb-sgc-intro.md#section_ett_spp_4hc).

## About this task

The playbook experience for onboarding connectors is activated with SGC Central in the CMDB Workspace. To configure the SGC Central application, see [Configuring SGC Central](../sgcc-configuring.md) and for more information on how to interact with a playbook, see [Interact with Playbook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/playbook-ui.md).

**Note:** Alternatively, you can configure a default connection already available from the installed or draft connections in SGC Central. Go to **All** &gt; **Service Graph Connectors**, then select **Setup** for the connector from the menu. To learn about installed and draft connections, see [Managing connections added for Service Graph Connectors in SGC Central](../sgcc-managing-connection.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **CMDB Workspace**.

2.  In the CMDB Workspace, select **SGC Central**.

3.  On the Overview page, select **Create connection**.

    **Tip:** Alternatively, you can select **Create connection** on the All connections page.

4.  On the Create connection window, select the Azure API Management connector type, and then select **Create connection**.

5.  Complete the initial prerequisites when setting up a connection for the first time using a connector.

    **Note:** This step is required only during the first-time setup. See [Perform initial setup tasks when creating a connection in SGC Central](../sgcc-first-time-setup.md).

6.  Enter connection details and test the API connection for importing Azure API Management data.

    1.  In the **Setup** stage of the playbook, select the **Create and test connection** activity.

    2.  On the form, fill in the fields.
