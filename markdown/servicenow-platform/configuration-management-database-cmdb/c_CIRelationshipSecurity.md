# CI relationship security

When applying security to CI relationships, it is important to apply the access controls both to the CI Relationship \(cmdb\_rel\_ci\) table and to create an operation editCIRelations to the \* table as well.

If the current instance has defined security for editCIRelations, it will be applied to edit\_ci\_relations automatically in the process of upgrading, and the out-of-date security will be removed.
