# Create a data refresh rule

Specify data refresh rules to determine if a CI is stale for a specific discovery source. Such CIs can then be updated by a lower-priority authorized discovery source.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cmdb\_editor and itil have read access, sn\_cmdb\_admin and itil\_admin \(on top\) have full access

## About this task

Data refresh rules are used in conjunction with static reconciliation rules to determine reconciliation steps for a CI. These rules determine if, when, and by which discovery source a CI can be updated. The precedence order of applying reconciliation rules to a class, remains the same even when there are data refresh rules for that same class.

Data refresh rules have no impact when dynamic reconciliation rules are in effect.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Configuration** &gt; **CI Class Manager**.

2.  Select **Hierarchy** to show the CI Classes list and then select the class for which to create a data refresh rule.

3.  In the class navigation bar, expand **Class Info** and then click **Reconciliation Rules**.

4.  Create a rule by selecting **Add** in the Data Refresh Rules section, or select an existing rule to edit. Then fill out the details in the Create Data Refresh Rules dialog box.

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Discovery source

</td><td>

Discovery source for which staleness is evaluated.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Effective Duration

</td><td>

The time period that is used for the staleness test.

 If the fields specified in the static reconciliation rule for the CI's class weren't updated by **Discovery source** within the specified **Effective Duration** — the CI is determined to be stale for **Discovery source** and a lower priority discovery source is authorized to update the CI.

 When set to 0 \(default\), the CI is determined to be stale for **Discovery source** immediately after an update and therefor, a lower priority discovery source will always be authorized to update the CI.

 If you enter a value with a prefix that is valid and a suffix that is not, such as `15 x` — the valid portion of the value is used \('15'\). If the entire value is invalid — the default value of 0 is used.
