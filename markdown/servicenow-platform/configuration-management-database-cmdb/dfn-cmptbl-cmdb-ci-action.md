# Define compatible CI actions

Allow a CMDB CI Lifecycle Management operation in which two specified CI actions can be applied simultaneously to a CI.

## Before you begin

Role required: none

## About this task

By default, it is not allowed to apply more than a single action to a CI. You can change that behavior by defining pairs of CI actions as compatible and therefore these actions can be applied simultaneously to a CI. For example you can specify that Provisioning and Patching are compatible CI actions, which lets you apply both to a CI at the same time.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Configuration** &gt; **Compatible CI Actions**.

2.  On the **Compatible CI Actions** page click **New** and fill out the form.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Action|First action in the compatibility actions pair.|
    |Compatible Action|Second action in the compatibility actions pair.|


## Result

An API can successfully apply the two specified actions simultaneously to a CI.
