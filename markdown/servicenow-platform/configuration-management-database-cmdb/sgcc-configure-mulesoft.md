# Configure API Service Graph Connector for MuleSoft using SGC Central

Set up scheduled import jobs to pull in MuleSoft Anypoint Platform data into your CMDB.

## Before you begin

Install API Service Graph Connector for MuleSoft version 1.0.0 or later from the ServiceNow Store. For ServiceNow Store installation steps, see [Install a ServiceNow Store application](../../platform-administration/application-manager/installing-applications-in-application-manager.md).

Obtain the Connected App credentials from your MuleSoft Anypoint Platform administrator. Make a note of the following details:

-   Client ID: The unique identifier for your Connected App.
-   Client Secret: The secret key for authenticating your Connected App.
-   Directory \(tenant\) ID: The MuleSoft organization identifier from which data is imported.

For more information on connector setup, see the [API Service Graph connector for MuleSoft - Setup Instructions \[KB2560348\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB2560348) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

Role required: The following table shows the roles required for each stage of the playbook.

|Stage|Role|
|-----|----|
|Prerequisites|admin|
|Setup|SGC-Admin \(sn\_cmdb\_int\_util.sgc\_admin\) or admin|

**Note:** The admin user role is required to run background scripts and to provide access to global tables to the SGC-Admin user. For information about the user roles for Service Graph Connectors, see [Service Graph Connector user roles](cmdb-sgc-intro.md#section_ett_spp_4hc).

## About this task

The playbook experience for onboarding connectors is activated with SGC Central in the CMDB Workspace. To configure the SGC Central application, see [Configuring SGC Central](../sgcc-configuring.md) and for more information on how to interact with a playbook, see [Interact with Playbook](../../build-workflows/workflow-studio/playbook-ui.md).

**Note:** Alternatively, you can configure a default connection already available from the installed or draft connections in SGC Central. Go to **All** &gt; **Service Graph Connectors**, then select **Setup** for the connector from the menu. To learn about installed and draft connections, see [Managing connections added for Service Graph Connectors in SGC Central](../sgcc-managing-connection.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **CMDB Workspace**.

2.  In the CMDB Workspace, select **SGC Central**.

3.  On the Overview page, select **Create connection**.

    **Tip:** Alternatively, you can select **Create connection** on the All connections page.

4.  On the Create connection window, select the MuleSoft connector type, and then select **Create connection**.

5.  Complete the initial prerequisites when setting up a connection for the first time using a connector.

    **Note:** This step is required only during the first-time setup. See [Perform initial setup tasks when creating a connection in SGC Central](../sgcc-first-time-setup.md).

6.  Enter connection details and test the API connection for importing MuleSoft data.

    1.  In the **Setup** stage of the playbook, select the **Create and test connection** activity.

    2.  On the form, fill in the fields.

## What to do next

Select **View all connections** to review the connection details. The created connection appears in the Installed connections list.

You can then manage connections from the SGC Central view of the CMDB Workspace. For more information, see [Managing connections added for Service Graph Connectors in SGC Central](../sgcc-managing-connection.md).
