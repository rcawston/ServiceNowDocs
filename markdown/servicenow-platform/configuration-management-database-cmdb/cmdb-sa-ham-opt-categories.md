# Managing opt-in and opt-out resource categories for HAM in CMDB success advisor

You can opt in to Hardware Asset Management \(HAM\) license resource categories to make the corresponding model categories available for selection in CMDB success advisor for HAM.

Before you can set up or update the HAM advisor scope in CMDB success advisor, at least one HAM license resource category must be opted in. Resource categories define the hardware types, such as Servers, Storage, or Mobile Device, covered by your HAM subscription. Only model categories belonging to opted-in resource categories appear in the CMDB success advisor for HAM.

The opted-in resource categories are set to `true` in the HAM Resource Category \[sn\_hamp\_resource\_category\] table. For more information, see [Opt-in or opt-out of HAM license resource categories](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/optin-optout-ham-license-resource-categories.md).

## Model category availability based on opt-in status

The opt-in status of resource categories determines which model categories are available in the HAM advisor.

The following table describes the HAM advisor behavior based on opt-in status.

|Status|Advisor behavior|
|------|----------------|
|No resource categories opted in|The Select model categories dialog box displays a message indicating that no categories are currently available. You must opt in to at least one resource category before you can configure or update the HAM advisor scope.|
|Resource categories opted in|The corresponding model categories appear in the **Available resource and model categories** column of the Select model categories and Edit model categories dialog boxes and can be selected for the HAM advisor scope.|
|Resource category opted out after selection|Model categories from that resource category are no longer available in the advisor. If those categories were previously selected for the HAM advisor scope, they may become unavailable and the dashboard scope may be reduced.|

## Opt in resource categories

Select HAM resource categories to make their model categories available for configuration in CMDB success advisor.

Role required: sn\_hamp.admin

To opt in resource categories, follow these steps:

1.  On the CMDB success advisor landing page, select **Select model categories** within the HAM card.

    See [Viewing the CMDB success advisor landing page](cmdb-sa-landing-page.md).

2.  If the dialog box displays **No model categories available**, select **Opt in categories** to open the HAM license resource categories management page.
3.  Select the resource categories included in your HAM subscription and opt them in.
4.  Return to CMDB success advisor and proceed with selecting model categories.

    For more information, see [Get started with CMDB success advisor setup for HAM](cmdb-sa-ham-get-started.md).


## Opt out resource categories

When a resource category is opted out in HAM, its model categories remain in the CMDB success advisor until you manually remove them. A message is displayed in the advisor indicating that opted-out resource categories are part of the current scope.

Role required: sn\_hamp.admin

To remove opted out resource categories, follow these steps:

1.  On the CMDB success advisor landing page, select **Edit model categories** within the HAM card.

    See [Viewing the CMDB success advisor landing page](cmdb-sa-landing-page.md).

2.  In the **Available resource and model categories** column, locate the opted-out resource category and clear its check box.
3.  Select **Save**.

Removing an opted-out resource category excludes all model categories associated with it from the HAM advisor scope and reduces the scope of your HAM advisor dashboard accordingly.
