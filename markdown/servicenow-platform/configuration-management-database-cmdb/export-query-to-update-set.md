# Export and import a query as an update set

Export a saved query definition to an XML file as an update set, which you can later import.

## Before you begin

Role required: To export — cmdb\_query\_builder. To import — user with permission to import an update set.

Domain in the exported query must be visible in both, source and destination instances.

## About this task

Export a query definition as an update set which you can later import and commit. This process lets you port a query between instances, such as from a development environment to a production environment. For more information about exporting and then committing update sets using XML files, see [Save an update set as a local XML file](../../application-development/system-update-sets/t_SaveAnUpdateSetAsAnXMLFile.md).

When exporting a combination query, the integrated Service Mapping query definition is included in the exported update set.

## Procedure

    1.  In the **Filter navigator**, enter `qb_saved_query.list`.

    5.  Wait for the **Query Exporter** to complete the export.

2.  Import the exported saved query:

    1.  Navigate to **System Update Sets** &gt; **Retrieved Update Sets**.

    2.  On the Retrieved Update Sets form, select **Import Update Sets from XML**.

    3.  On the Import XML page, select **Choose file**.

    4.  Select the exported XML file.

    5.  Select **Upload**.

    6.  Open the new record that was added to the Retrieved Update Sets list view.

    7.  On the Retrieved Update Set form, select **Preview Update Set Batch**.

    8.  Close the Batch Update Set Preview dialog box.

    9.  Select **Commit Update Set Batch**.

    10. Close the Commit Update Set Batch dialog box.

The imported query is added to the Query Builder saved queries on the instance.
