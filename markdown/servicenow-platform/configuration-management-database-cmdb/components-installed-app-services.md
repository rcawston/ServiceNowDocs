# Components installed with application services

**Note:** The Application Files table lists the components that are installed with this application. For instructions on how to access this table, see [Find components installed with an application](../../platform-administration/find-components.md).

</td></tr><tr><td id="manual-ci-inclusion-exclusion-list">

Manual CI Inclusions / Exclusions \[svc\_manual\_ci\_exclusions\_inclusions.list\]

</td><td>

Contains CI classes included or excluded from application services during population of manual or dynamic application services. Service population happens when-   Manually adding CIs to an application service
-   Converting a business service to an application service
-   Creating or updating an application service using APIs
-   Manually updating an application service with changes from the CMDB

**Note:** The Manual CI Exclusions/Inclusions \[svc\_manual\_ci\_exclusions\_inclusions\] table doesn't include CIs added using traversal rules.

 In the base system, the following CI classes are excluded:

-   NAT \[cmdb\_ci\_translation\_rule\]
-   Endpoint \[cmdb\_ci\_endpoint\]
-   Qualifier \[cmdb\_ci\_qualifier\]
-   Application cluster \[cmdb\_ci\_application\_cluster\]

 CIs of any CI class that is not configured for exclusion in this table can be added to application services.

**Note:** In the CMDB hierarchy, a class derives the included/excluded setting from its closest ancestor. If a class has its own explicit setting, it overrides the derived setting.

 This table supports the functionality that was earlier supported using the following deprecated property: sa.mapping.user.manual.citype.blacklist.

</table>## Properties installed

To access application services properties, navigate to **All** &gt; **Configuration** &gt; **Application Services** &gt; **Properties**. The role required for modifying property values, is app\_service\_admin.

If Service Mapping is deployed, see [Properties installed with Service Mapping](../../it-operations-management/service-mapping/components-installed-with-service-mapping.md) for additional application service properties.

**Note:** To open the System Properties \[sys\_properties\] table, enter `sys_properties.list` in the navigation filter.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Coefficient of aggregation interval. 0 value means no aggregation is performed on history timeline. The purpose of this property is to decrease number of changes in history timeline by increasing the interval allowed between changes
