**Remediate manuallyUse the Duplicate CI Remediator**

</td><td>

Use the Duplicate CI Remediator built on Core UI to remediate the task.

 To continue with this choice of remediation, see [Remediate a de-duplication task \(manual\)](reconcile-dup-task.md).

**Use the Duplicate CI Remediator in Restricted Mode**

</td><td>

Appears only if the **glide.duplicate\_ci\_remediator.enable\_restricted\_mode** system property is set to **true**. You might need to use this option if remediation is blocked because loading the de-duplication task times out. This option might be relevant when there is a large number of related items associated with a de-duplication task, allowing remediation to continue with the limited features in a restricted mode. For more information about using this option to restrict the use of related items in de-duplication remediation and allow remediation to proceed, see [Using restricted mode within the Duplicate CI Remediator \[KB1542272\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view_customer.do?sysparm_article=KB1542272).

 To continue with this choice, see [Remediate a de-duplication task \(manual\)](reconcile-dup-task.md). Skip to step \#5 in the procedure.
