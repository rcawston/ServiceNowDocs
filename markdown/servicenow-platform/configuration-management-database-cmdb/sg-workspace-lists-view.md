The Lists view in Service Graph Workspace provides access to CIs within the CMDB hierarchy and to records in tables that aren't descendants of the Configuration Item \[cmdb\_ci\] table, but are important in the CMDB ecosystem.

## Default lists

Provides lists of records from the associated list tables as specified in the Platform table UX List Menu Configuration \[sys\_ux\_list\_menu\_config\] table, in the Service Graph Workspace record.
