# Installed with Compliance

These components are installed with the Certification Core plugin.

Demo data is included with the Desired State and Architecture Compliance plugins.

The Certification Core plugin adds or modifies these tables.

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Audit \[cert\_audit\]

</td><td>

Contains all the data required to run an audit, including the users assigned to follow-on tasks and the run schedule.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Audit Result \[cert\_audit\_result\]

</td><td>

Contains the results of specific, certification audits.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Follow On Task \[cert\_follow\_on\_task\]

</td><td>

Contains the tasks that were generated from an audit discrepancy.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Certification Template \[cert\_template\]

</td><td>

 Contains the records to certify, the expected attributes, and the expected relationship values.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Certification Condition \[cert\_cond\]

</td><td>

Base table that defines the desired attribute or relationship conditions used in templates.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Certification Attribute Condition \[cert\_attr\_cond\]

</td><td>

Contains the conditions that define the desired CI attribute values. This table extends the Certification Condition \[cert\_cond\] base table.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Certification CI Relationship Condition \[cert\_ci\_rel\_cond\]

</td><td>

Contains the CI to CI relationship conditions. This table extends the Certification Condition \[cert\_cond\] base table.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Certification User Relationship Condition \[cert\_user\_rel\_cond\]

</td></tr><tr><td>

Certification Group Relationship Condition \[cert\_group\_rel\_cond\]

</td><td>

Contains the CI to group relationship conditions. This table extends the Certification Condition \[cert\_cond\] base table.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Certification Related List Condition \[cert\_related\_list\_cond\]

</td><td>

Contains the related list conditions. This table extends the Certification Condition \[cert\_cond\] base table.

</table>## User roles

The certification role is automatically assigned to all users with the itil role when the [Certification Core plugin](c_ActivatingCompliance.md) is activated or when compliance applications are upgraded. Certification core installs two business rules, both called **Add Certification Role To Manager**, that perform similar tasks on different tables. One rule checks for a manager specified on the User \[sys\_user\] table, and the other checks for the certification role on the User Role \[sys\_user\_has\_role\] table. When both a manager and the certification role are specified for a user, the system automatically grants the certification role to the manager. This functionality ensures that a certification task can be escalated successfully to the next level. The system grants this automatic role to the user's immediate manager only and not to others up the management chain.

**Note:** When a manager has only the certification role and no other role, the manager is considered a Requester and is not counted as a subscribed user \(Fulfiller\).

|Name|Contains roles|Description|
|----|--------------|-----------|
|certification|none|Can read and update certification tasks to resolve discrepancies.|
|certification\_filter\_admin|none|Can create, read, and update certification filters.|
|certification\_admin|certification, certification\_filter\_admin|Can manage the entire certification process. These users can create, edit, and delete all certification records.|
