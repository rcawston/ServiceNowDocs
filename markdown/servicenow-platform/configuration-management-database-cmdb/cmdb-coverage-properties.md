</table>## Custom system property

You can create the sn\_cmdb\_ip\_cov.log\_associated\_missing\_ip custom system property for the CMDB Coverage application. This property must be created in the CMDB Coverage application scope. The custom property that you create is listed in the System Properties \[sys\_properties\] table. For more information about creating custom system properties, see [Add a system property](../../platform-administration/r_AvailableSystemProperties.md).

To populate data in the Discovery schedule gaps to allocated IP \[sn\_cmdb\_ip\_cov\_m2m\_discovery\_schedule\_gap\]​ table, create the sn\_cmdb\_ip\_cov.log\_associated\_missing\_ip custom system property, and set the value to `true`.
