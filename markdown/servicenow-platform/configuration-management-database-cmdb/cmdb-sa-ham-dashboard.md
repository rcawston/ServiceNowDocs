# Monitoring CMDB data quality using dashboard metrics in CMDB success advisor for HAM

The CMDB success advisor for HAM dashboard enables CMDB administrators to identify and address data quality issues specific to HAM in the Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\).

**Important:** When you select a segment or count on a chart from a CMDB success advisor dashboard, the KPI Details page opens. On the page, you can analyze how a specific metric trends over time. Additionally, the Remediation actions panel appears when remediation actions are available for that card. Use the panel to improve the quality of CMDB. To learn more, see [KPI Details](../../now-intelligence/kpi-details.md) and [Improving CMDB data quality for HAM](cmdb-sa-ham-remediation.md).

</table>## Dashboard features

The dashboard provides clear, consolidated insights into hardware asset data quality and asset status. Use the dashboard to identify and resolve data quality issues within the CMDB through dedicated sections, filters, indicators, and visual reports. Gain valuable insights into CMDB performance related to HAM.

Targeted CMDB metrics focus remediation efforts. Regularly monitor these metrics and follow suggested remediation actions to systematically improve CMDB data quality over time.

**Important:** The dashboard data is filtered based on the Selected model categories and Date range filters. See [Filters](cmdb-sa-ham-dashboard.md#section_an4_nnj_fgc).

|Feature|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|CIs by model category|Displays the breakdown of operational CIs by associated model category to highlight CI distribution in the CMDB.|
|CIs by data integration source|Displays the breakdown of operational CIs by data integration source to highlight their contribution to CMDB population.|
|[CIs missing model data and other key attributes](cmdb-sa-ham-dashboard.md#section_tgc_yz3_fgc)|Displays key metrics related to CIs missing model details, ownership, and other key attributes, leading to incomplete records and operational inefficiencies.|
|[CI data quality issues](cmdb-sa-ham-dashboard.md#section_rzg_2mj_fgc)|Displays key metrics related to CIs that have not been updated or may have duplicate records, leading to outdated information and inconsistencies in the CMDB.|
|[CI and asset-related issues](cmdb-sa-ham-dashboard.md#section_hmb_vmj_fgc)|Displays key metrics related to mismatches and missing links between CIs and assets, leading to incomplete asset life cycle tracking and reporting issues.|
