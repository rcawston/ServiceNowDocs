# View a reclassification task

Reclassification tasks are created for CIs that couldn't be automatically reclassified during the identification process. Review these tasks to locate the CIs and decide if to reclassify them.

## About this task

The properties you use to disable automatic CI reclassification determine whether reclassification tasks are created for those CIs that couldn't be automatically reclassified:

-   Using any one of the 'glide.class.&lt;reclassification operation&gt;.enabled' properties \(such as **glide.class.upgrade.enabled**\): Reclassification tasks are created.
-   Using any one of the 'glide.identification\_engine.update\_without\_&lt;reclassification operation&gt;\_enabled' properties \(such as **glide.identification\_engine.update\_without\_switch\_enabled**\): Reclassification tasks aren't created.

For more information about reclassification during IRE processing, see [Configure CI reclassification during IRE processing](c_CIReclassification.md#).

## Before you begin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Configuration** &gt; **Identification/Reconciliation** &gt; **Reclassification Tasks**.

2.  Select a reclassification task.

3.  Examine the details on the Reclassification Task form.
