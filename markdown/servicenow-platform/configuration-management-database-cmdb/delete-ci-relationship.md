# Delete a CI relationship

Maintain the integrity of the CMDB by deleting any CI relationships that are no longer relevant or needed for a CI. Use the relationship editor to delete CI relationships.

## About this task

As an alternative to the CI relationship editor, [Unified Map](../unified-map/cmdb-workspace-unified-map.md) in the [CMDB Workspace store app](cmdb-workspace.md)or in [Service Graph Workspace store app](sg-workspace.md) provides the latest functionality for editing CI relationships. For more information, see [Edit relationships in Unified Map](../unified-map/unified-map-edit-connection.md).

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cmdb\_editor, itil, or asset

**Note:** Deleting a relationship to a dependent CI can result in identification problems as the dependent CI will no longer have a relationship to the CI it depends on.

## Procedure

1.  Launch the relationship editor:

    1.  Open the CI form of the CI for which you want to delete a relationship.

    2.  Locate the **Related Items** section near the center of the form.

    3.  Click the plus \(+\) icon on the **Related items** section.

2.  In the Relationship Editor, in the Relationships section, select the relationships that you want to delete for the CI.

3.  Click the **Delete selected relationships** icon.

4.  Click **Save** or **Save and Exit**.
