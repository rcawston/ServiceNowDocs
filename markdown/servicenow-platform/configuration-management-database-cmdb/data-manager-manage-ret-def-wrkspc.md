# Manage retirement definitions for CMDB Data Manager

Use CMDB Workspaceor Service Graph Workspace to create,delete, edit, or activate retirement definitions in your organization, for a class. Tables that are targeted in CMDB Data Manager life-cycle policies, must be associated with an active retirement definition. Target CIs in Retire policies, are set to match their associated class retirement definitions.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cmdb\_admin

## About this task

Some retirement definitions in the base system are inactive and you must activate any retirement definition that you want to use with a CMDB Data Manager life-cycle policy by setting its **Active** attribute to **true**. Retirement definitions are stored in the CMDB Retirement Custom Definitions \[cmdb\_retirement\_custom\_definitions\] table.

When a CMDB Data manager retires a CI, ensure that any of its dependent CIs are also retired and don't remain as orphan CIs, by enabling management of dependent CIs. Orphan CIs can impact the consistency, accuracy, and integrity of the CMDB.

-   For information about enabling and managing dependent CIs, especially in the context of cascade-retire, cascade-archive, and cascade-delete, see [Dependent CIs management](manage-dependent-ci.md).
-   For details and definitions of independent and dependent CIs, see [CMDB classifications and class dependency](c_CMDBClassifications.md).

**Note:**

-   Always be aware of the automatic derivation of retirement definitions throughout the class hierarchy. For example, an active retirement definition for the Configuration Item \[cmdb\_ci\] class can potentially be in effect throughout the entire CMDB hierarchy \(aside from classes with their own retirement definition\).
-   You can't deactivate \(or delete\) the retirement definition of the Configuration Item \[cmdb\_ci\] class.
-   Each CMDB class can be associated with only a single retirement definition.

## Procedure

1.  Open either workspace:

    -   Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **CMDB Workspace** and then select the **Data Manager** quick link on the Home view.
    -   Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Service Graph Workspace** and in the navigation panel, select the Governance icon. Then, in the Governance navigation pane, select **Data Manager overview**.
2.  In the Get started area on the Data Manager overview page, select **Manage retirement definitions**.

3.  On the Data Manager settings page, review the Retirement definitions list view.

    1.  Drill down to a definition and then, on the Retirement definition form, toggle the **Active** switch to activate or deactivate a definition.

    2.  Edit the conditions on the definition.

    3.  Select **Save definition**.

4.  On the Data Manager settings page, select **Add definition**.

5.  Fill out the Retirement definition form and then select **Save definition**.
