# Monitoring CMDB data quality using dashboard metrics in CMDB success advisor for Data Foundations

The CMDB success advisor for Data Foundations dashboard enables CMDB administrators to identify and address data quality issues specific to principal classes in the Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\).

**Important:** When you select a segment or count on a chart from a CMDB success advisor dashboard, the KPI Details page opens. On the page, you can analyze how a specific metric trends over time. Additionally, the Remediation actions panel appears when remediation actions are available for that card. Use the panel to improve the quality of CMDB. To learn more, see [KPI Details](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/kpi-details.md) and [Improving CMDB data quality for Data Foundations](cmdb-sa-df-remediation.md).

</table>## Dashboard features

The dashboard provides clear, consolidated insights into principal CI class data quality and completeness. Use the dashboard to identify and resolve data quality issues within the CMDB through dedicated sections, filters, indicators, and visual reports. Gain valuable insights into CMDB performance related to Data Foundations. Targeted CMDB metrics focus remediation efforts. Regularly monitor these metrics and follow suggested remediation actions to systematically improve CMDB data quality over time.

**Important:** The dashboard data is filtered based on the Selected principal classes and Date range filters. See [Filters](cmdb-sa-df-dashboard.md#section_xsj_x4l_k3c).

|Feature|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|CIs by principal class|Displays the breakdown of operational CIs by principal CI class to highlight CI distribution in the CMDB.|
|CIs by data integration source|Displays the breakdown of operational CIs by data integration source to highlight their contribution to CMDB population.|
|[CIs missing key attributes](cmdb-sa-df-dashboard.md#section_opb_gpl_k3c)|Displays completeness metrics per principal CI class, identifying classes below the defined threshold.|
|[CI data quality issues](cmdb-sa-df-dashboard.md#section_wx1_lpl_k3c)|Displays key metrics related to CIs that have not been updated or may have duplicate records, leading to outdated information and inconsistencies in the CMDB.|
