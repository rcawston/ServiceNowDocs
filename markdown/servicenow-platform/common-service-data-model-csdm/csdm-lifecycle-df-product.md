# Definitions of life-cycle values for product entities

The product life-cycle value pairs represent the overall life cycle of a product model, a specific version, or a product configuration. The life-cycle values for the product life-cycle process are visible only in Product \(Models\) tables.

## Definitions of product life cycle stage and life cycle stage status values

-   **Ideation life cycle stage**

    New product models to determine feasibility and potential adoption.

    -   **Under Evaluation**: The product is being assessed for business value, functionality, and technical viability. 
    -   **Pilot**: In a small-scale deployment, the product is being tested in a controlled environment before broader adoption. 
-   **Design life cycle stage**

    After a product is approved for development or configuration, its structure and features are defined.

    -   **Chartered**: The product model has been formally approved for development or procurement. 
    -   **Design**: The product is being architected, including defining specifications, features, and configurations. 
    -   **Planning**: The product is undergoing activities of creating and managing planning items that describe intended future work or change — such as new services, applications, or capabilities — and aligning them to business needs and outcomes. This represents proposed or in-progress work that is not yet live in operations. Planning ensures that business strategy \(from the Ideation &amp; Strategy domain\) is converted into actionable initiatives that will shape the services and applications managed in the instance. The CSDM uses the Planning Item \(from the Strategic Portfolio Management application\) as the primary record type.
-   **Build &amp; Integrate life cycle stage**

    The product is being developed, tested, and prepared for operational deployment.

    -   **Build**: The product is being developed, covers the activities from code commit through compiled or packaged deliverables being ready for deployment to a lower \(non-production\) environment.
    -   **In Production**: Covers the final promotion and release of changes into the live, customer-facing environment, with all required governance.
-   **Operational life cycle stage**

    The product is actively available and used within the organization.

    -   **Available**: The product is fully developed and ready for procurement or deployment.
    -   **Pending Retirement**: The product is still operational but is scheduled to be phased out.
    -   **End of Support**: The product is no longer receiving updates, maintenance, or vendor support.

        **Note:** A CI might be in the **Operational** stage, but might no longer be supported by the vendor or publisher or third party. That doesn’t mean, however, that it can be or should be retired.

-   **End of Life life cycle stage**

    The product is no longer in active use and is being retired.

    -   **Retired**: The product is no longer available for new purchases or deployments but may still exist in limited use.
    -   **Obsolete**: The product is completely phased out and is no longer supported or used.
