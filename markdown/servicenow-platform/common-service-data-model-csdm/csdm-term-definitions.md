Business service offering

</td><td>

Business service offerings are the starting point for configuring Service Portfolio Management. Business service offerings inherit from Business Services. Business service offerings consist of one or more service commitments that define the level of service in terms of availability, scope, pricing, and other factors. For example, an organization might offer two levels of desktop support:

-   A silver offering of upgrades and virus protection.
-   A gold offering with the silver commitments plus a response time guarantee of 30 minutes between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday.

The technical service offering comes from the service, based on how the parent serves a specific technical need. Every operational technical service must be associated with at least one technology management offering.
