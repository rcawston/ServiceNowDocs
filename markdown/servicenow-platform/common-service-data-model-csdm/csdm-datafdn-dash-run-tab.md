# 'Run' stage reports on the CSDM Data Foundations dashboard

Run stage reports on the CSDM Data Foundations dashboard

## Reports on the Run tab

In this example, a report on the **Run** tab indicates that several business service offerings don't have the required relationships to service instances. With this knowledge, Service owners can add the relationships to confirm that customer service agents get complete information on the upstream impacts of applications that are down.

To view detailed information on the impact of a metric and for details on working on issues, select the appropriate **Remediation playbook URL**.

-   **CSDM Foundation Indicators report**
    -   The **Priority** value is the product of the weight of the metric and the severity of the actual score. Priority ranges from 1 — Critical \(the highest priority\), to 5 — Low \(the lowest priority\).
    -   The **Result** column displays a color-coded bar showing the percentage of CIs or the measured item that are in conformance for the key foundational metric.

        -   Red: 0–50% are in conformance.
        -   Yellow: 50–90% are in conformance.
        -   Green: More than 90% are in conformance.
        To promote optimum performance, the system stops collecting data for some metrics when they reach a specified number of non-conforming CIs. For information on managing data collection for a metric that isn't needed or that affects performance of the dashboard, see [Manage performance](../configuration-management-database-cmdb/csdm-cmdb-foundations-dashboards.md#section-manage-performance).

    -   The **Remediation playbook URL** column displays links to knowledge articles in Now Support with instructions for bringing the CIs into conformance. Use your Now Support credentials to access the knowledge article.
