# Life cycle of tangible/physical CIs

The tangible/physical life-cycle states represent the overall life cycle of physical assets and CIs as related to their products. Tangible/physical assets are physical items that are stocked, for example computers, monitors, and keyboards. The stages and statuses for the tangible/physical life-cycle process are visible only in hardware-related tables in Asset Management and the CMDB.

## Life-cycle values for tangible/physical CIs

For definitions of the values in the diagram, see [Definitions of life-cycle values for tangible/physical CIs](csdm-lifecycle-df-tangible-physical.md).

![Relationships between CSDM stages and life cycle values.](../image/csdm-lifecycle-vp-tangible-physical.png)

**Note:** The \[life\_cycle\_control\] table uses the type of CI \(tangible/physical, document and contract, location and so on\) to determine which *life cycle stage status* values are available for each *life cycle stage*.

For additional information on how you can benefit from implementing life-cycle value pairs for CMDB entities, see the ['Map existing status values to CSDM life-cycle value pairs' section in the 'Foundation domain' topic](foundation-domain.md).

The tangible/physical life-cycle states represent the overall life cycle of physical assets and CIs as related to their products. Tangible/physical assets are physical items that are stocked, for example computers, monitors, and keyboards. The stages and statuses for the tangible/physical life-cycle process are visible only in hardware-related tables in Asset Management and the CMDB.

Because a service instance might depend on a hardware \(tangible/physical\) device that other service instances depend on, you must take care when retiring a service instance.
