# Modify a survey definition

You can configure additional options for a survey definition.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin, survey\_creator, or survey\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Survey** &gt; **View Surveys**.

    Each survey definition is stored as a record on the Assessment Metric Type `[asmt_metric_type]` table with a modified view for survey use.

2.  Open a survey definition.

    The **Response Trend** chart with the weekly trend of the survey instance count, and the **Survey Summary** chart with the overall summary response based on instance states are displayed.

3.  Modify the fields on the Survey Definition form.

    **Note:** You can only edit a survey that has the same application scope as that of your current session.

Owners of the survey. You can add a user with the survey\_creator, survey\_admin, or assessment\_admin role.

</td></tr><tr id="tr_SurveyAnonymous"><td>

Anonymize responses

</td><td>

Check box to ensure that all responses for this survey are stored without the submitting user names. When a user submits a survey, the system clears the **Assigned to** field for the associated survey instance. Also, survey responses for anonymous surveys do not contain **Assigned to** values.**Note:** The **Assigned to** field is cleared. However, each response record includes the **Created By** and **Updated By** fields that are accessible to users with the survey\_admin role.

</td></tr><tr id="tr_SurveyState"><td>

</td><td>

Status of the survey: **Draft** or **Published**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Allow retake

</td><td>

Check box that allows users to modify their answers to a completed survey. Users can resubmit a survey as many times as they want until the due date. After that date, the system removes the survey from the user's My Assessments &amp; Surveys page.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Scheduled job

</td><td>

Scheduled job that the system creates for this survey definition when the schedule period is a repeating interval. The system sets the scheduled job to run according to the selected schedule period.-   If you change the schedule period and save the survey definition, the system deletes the old scheduled job.
-   If you selected a recurring schedule period, a new scheduled job is created.
For example, if you change the schedule period from **Daily** to **Weekly** and save the record:-   The system deletes the daily scheduled job.
-   Creates a weekly one set to run a week from the current date.
 This field is visible to administrators only if the schedule period is **Daily**, **Weekly**, **Monthly**, or **Yearly**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Assessment duration

</td><td>

The length of time to complete assigned survey instances, starting from the time the survey instance is generated. The assessment duration sets the Due date for each survey instance.
