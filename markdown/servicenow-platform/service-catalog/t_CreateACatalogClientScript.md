# Create a Service Catalog client script

You can create client scripts to customize the catalog.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

Use catalog client scripts to control the behavior of the catalog items when presented to your users. Catalog client scripts can be applied to a catalog item or a variable set. These scripts run on the browser instead of the server, allowing you to better control the information that the user submits.

The priority order for g\_form APIs is:

1.  Mandatory \(highest\)
2.  ReadOnly/Display

If a variable is set to mandatory and doesn’t have a value, readonly or hide doesn't work on that variable. If a variable is hidden or readonly, and then set to mandatory, the variable field becomes visible or editable.

This priority order is also applicable for variable sets and containers. If a variable set or container has a mandatory variable without any value, then the container or variable set can’t be hidden.
