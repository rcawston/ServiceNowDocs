    In the **Components** tab, both **Shipping Location** and **Shipping Address** are not supported simultaneously. Deselect the selected component to select the other component.

    If you enable **Shipping Address** in the **Components** tab, the editable **Shipping address** field is displayed in the cart preview screen. If you enable **Shipping Location** in the **Components** tab, the editable **Shipping location** field and a read-only **Shipping address** field are displayed in the cart preview screen.
