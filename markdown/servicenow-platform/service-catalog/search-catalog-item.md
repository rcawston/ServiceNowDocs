# Configure keyword search for catalog items

When you search for a catalog item by a keyword in Service Catalog, the search results are displayed by considering a few fields of the catalog table.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

If the keyword doesn’t have exact matches, its closest matches are displayed as **Did you mean** suggestions. This search functionality is also applicable in Service Portal.

The search results are sorted in the following order based on the frequency of the keyword:

-   Catalog items whose **Name** field contains the keyword \(top\).
-   Catalog items whose **Meta** field contains the keyword.

    **Note:** The **Meta** field is used for the Zing search, and if AI search is enabled, the field is used for the keyword search as well. If the **Meta** field is empty, the Zing search uses other sources, such as short descriptions and names.

-   Catalog items whose **Description** or **Short description** field contains the keyword.
-   Categories whose **Name** or **Description** field contains the keyword.
-   Catalogs whose **Name** or **Description** field contains the key term, or the catalog items whose **Class** field contains the keyword \(bottom\).

**Note:**

-   If your organization has multiple service catalogs, a search returns a result only from the catalog being viewed.
-   Search results return an item only when the item is active, has a valid catalog and category association, and you’re authorized to view the item.
