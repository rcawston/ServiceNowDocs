## Restrict access by a script

Service Catalog enables you to control access to a service catalog item or category with a custom script.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Catalog** &gt; **Maintain Items** or **Service Catalog** &gt; **Maintain Categories**.

2.  Open the relevant catalog item or category.

3.  [Configure the form](../../platform-administration/configure-form-layout.md) to add the **Entitlement Script** field.

    ![entitlement script](../image/EntitlementScript.png "Entitlement Script")

4.  In the **Entitlement Script** field, enter the access control script.

    Sample Scripts:

    The following example script grants access to a catalog item named French Blackberry to users with a language of Fr \(French\):

    ```
    gs.log ( 'Running Entitlement script for French Blackberry' ) ;
     
     if (gs. getUser ( ). getLanguage ( ) == 'fr' ) 
        answer = true ; else 
        answer = false ;
     
    answer ;
    ```

    The following example script could be used to distinguish between two categories of users \(one with full access and one with restricted access\) on the catalog of services:

    ```
    var userid  = gs. getUserID ( ) ; var now_GR  = new GlideRecord ( 'sys_user' ) ; 
    now_GR. get ( 'sys_id' , userid ) ; 
     
     if (now_GR. source )
        answer = true ; else
        answer = false ; 
     
    answer ;
    ```

    Overriding Entitlement Scripts by Role

    1.  Navigate to **Service Catalog** &gt; **Properties**.
    2.  Enter the roles for which to override the entitlement script \(grant access\) in the property List of roles \(comma-separated\) that can override normal entitlement checking inside the catalog. An itil role of "itil" means that the itil role can order any catalog item, even one protected by entitlement restrictions.
