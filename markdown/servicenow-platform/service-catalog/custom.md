## Custom

This variable inserts a UI macro into the catalog item.

UI macros in the service catalog do not support the following glide\_list functions: clickthrough, slushbucket editing, and email field.

-   Use [phase one](../../api-reference/scripts/c_ExtensionsToJellySyntax.md) Jelly only for any UI macros added as variables. Phase two Jelly within the macro is not processed and appears on the page as standard content.
-   This variable is not yet supported on Classic Mobile devices.
-   This variable is supported in Service Portal through widgets. Create a widget with the same functionality as that of a macro and link the widget with the variable.
