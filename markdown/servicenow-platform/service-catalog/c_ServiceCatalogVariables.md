# Service catalog variables

Service catalog variables capture and pass on information about choices a customer makes when ordering a catalog item. Variables help define the structure of a catalog item form that is displayed to the customer.

For example, you can define a variable called **Memory** to provide users with memory options at an extra cost for a PC catalog item. An Apple iPhone catalog item can use a variable called **Color** that allows customers to select the color when they order the phone from the catalog. You can define some variables to affect an item price, depending on the choices made.

Service Catalog provides several types of variables, which are also referred to as questions. Variables can be stored, accessed from multiple places, and passed between tasks in a process when fulfilling a request. They can be displayed on the Requested Item and Catalog Task forms after an item has been ordered.

You can define service catalog variables with the catalog\_admin role.
