# Container start, container split, and container end

The container start, container split, and container end variables define a layout for a container that can hold more variables.

Use the container start and container end variables to define the start and end points of a container layout. The container end must be used along with the container start to close a container.

A container layout can be split into two or three columns using the container split variable. By default, the split is calculated at the 50% mark.

A container is similar to a [variable set](c_ServiceCatalogVariableSets.md). Unlike a variable set, containers can be used anywhere, including inside a variable set. Containers can also be nested inside each other.

For more help with selecting the appropriate container type, see the [Determining if you are using the correct container variable \[KB0539982\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0539982) article in the HI Knowledge Base.

**Note:**

-   The container variables are not yet supported on mobile devices.
-   Container start, container split, and container end variables are supported in Service Portal. However, if the settings are done on the top-level container, a maximum of two-column layouts can be achieved.
-   Variable sets are also considered as containers. So, a container start variable with a two-column layout under a variable set is not supported in Service Portal.

To reproduce the container shown in the following figure, enter the following settings when creating a container start variable:

-   Select a **Layout** with 2 Columns Wide, alternating sides.
-   Select the **Display title** check box to use a collapsible title bar.
