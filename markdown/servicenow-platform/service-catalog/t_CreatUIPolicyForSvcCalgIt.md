Create conditions for the UI policy using catalog item variables. The policy is applied if the conditions evaluate to be true. For example, a catalog item of **Schedule a Move** may have a condition of **move\_from &gt; is &gt; San Diego**. The UI policy is applied when an employee schedules a move from San Diego to any other company location.**Note:** The label of a variable associated with a variable set reflects the variable set name.
