# Service Catalog topic blocks in Virtual Agent powered by NLU

You can design a topic conversation in the Virtual Agent powered by Natural Language Understanding \(NLU\) by including reusable topic blocks to perform request submission tasks.

## Search Catalog Item

You can use this topic block to search for a catalog item based on the search criteria. If there are multiple search results, you can select one from a carousel view.

|Parameter|Description|

|query\_term|Keyword to search for a catalog item. For information on configuring keyword search for a catalog item, see [Configure keyword search for catalog items](search-catalog-item.md).|
|catalogs|Comma-separated list of catalogs where a catalog item should be searched for.|
|result\_limit|Number of search results that should be displayed. By default, this number is set to 5.|

</table>## Virtual Agent render types

A catalog item can be rendered in Virtual Agent as a conversation, window, pop-up, or inline.

## Catalog item request using a conversation render type

A user can submit a request in the conversation mode \(by answering the questions in line\).

![Virtual Agent rendered as a conversation](../image/va-conversation-catalog.png)

The following conditions must be met when a user requests a catalog item in the conversation mode in Virtual Agent powered by NLU.

-   A catalog item cannot have more than the number of questions specified in the **glide.sc.conversational.request.question.limit** property. By default, this number is set to 10. For more information about this property, see [Service Catalog properties](r_ServiceCatalogProperties.md).
-   A catalog item can have non-scripted catalog UI policies. These UI policies should be defined such that variables are affected sequentially, that is, only a variable with the lower order affects a variable with the higher order.
-   A catalog item cannot have catalog client scripts that are defined for Now Mobile or Service Portal.
-   Only the following variables are supported:
    -   Attachment
    -   Check box \(A group of check box variables isn't supported\)
    -   Date
    -   Date/Time
    -   Email
    -   IP Address
    -   Label
    -   Lookup Multiple Choice \(without pricing implications and advanced reference qualifier\)
    -   Lookup Select Box \(without pricing implications and advanced reference qualifier\)
    -   Multiple Choice \(without pricing implications\)
    -   Multi Line Text
    -   Numeric Scale \(without pricing implications\)
    -   Reference \(without pricing implications and advanced reference qualifier\)

        **Note:** Reference type variables that correspond to a table that has more than 7000 records are not supported. The upper limit for the number of records can be specified in the **glide.sc.va.reference\_question\_choices.limit** property. By default, it is set to 7000.

    -   Requested For \(without pricing implications and advanced reference qualifier\)
    -   Rich Text Label
    -   Select Box \(without pricing implications\)
    -   Single Line Text
    -   URL
    -   Wide Single Line Text
    -   Yes / No
    -   Container variables
-   The following variable attributes are supported:

    -   ref\_ac\_order\_by
    -   allowed\_extensions
    -   max\_file\_size
    **Note:** All the other variable attributes are ignored in Virtual Agent.

-   A catalog item can have a single-row variable set but not a multi-row variable set.
-   If a catalog item has a default value configured for a question, the default value is displayed in Virtual Agent, which enables the user to proceed with the default value without having to select it manually. The user can also choose a different value other than the default value.
-   If a catalog item has a data lookup configured for a question, the setter value is displayed in Virtual Agent, which enables the user to proceed with the setter value or choose a different value. A catalog item with data lookup is not supported as a conversational item when the setter question precedes the matcher question.
-   User cannot skip the following type of questions for a catalog item:
    -   Lookup Multiple Choice
    -   Select Box
    -   Lookup Select Box
    -   Yes/No
    -   Numeric Scale \(If **Do not select first choice** configuration is not selected\)
    -   Multiple Choice \(If **Do not select first choice** configuration is not selected, or **Include none choice** configuration is selected\)
-   If the user is using Virtual Agent in a different supported collaboration tool like Microsoft Teams:
    -   Searching for a value using the search icon in choice type of fields is not supported.

        ![Searching for a choice field in Microsoft Teams](../image/msteams-choice.png "Choice type fields in Microsoft Teams")

        ![Searching for choice field in Virtual Agent](../image/va-choice.png "Choice type fields in Virtual Agent")

    -   Searching for a value in reference type of fields is performed in the form of a question.

        ![Searching for reference field in Virtual Agent](../image/va-reference.png "Reference type field in Virtual Agent")


If the catalog item is non-conversational, the request form can appear as any of these render types:

-   Inline
-   Pop-up
-   Window

The conditions determine whether the catalog item form for the non-conversational catalog item will appear as inline, pop-up, or window.

**Note:** Based on the number of questions, a **glide.sc.va.inline\_render.question.limit** property determines whether the catalog item form appears as inline or pop-up. By default, the property's value is 20.

<table id="table_nv2_hbj_dcc"><thead><tr><th>

Conditions

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Inline

</td><td>

-   The catalog item doesn’t contain custom or UI page variables.
-   If the catalog item contains 20 or fewer questions, the item form appears as inline. The default value of the **glide.sc.va.inline\_render.question.limit** property is 20.
-   The catalog item doesn’t contain multi-row variable set \(MRVS\).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Pop-up

</td><td>

-   The catalog item doesn’t contain custom or UI page variables.
-   If the catalog item contains more than 20 questions, the item form appears as a pop-up. The default value of the **glide.sc.va.inline\_render.question.limit** property is 20.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Window

</td><td>

-   The catalog item contains custom or UI page variables.
-   The **glide.sc.va.render\_type.legacy** property is set to true.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>## Catalog item request using an inline render type

Catalog item requesters can submit a catalog item by filling the form inline in the Virtual Agent powered by NLU. While requesting a catalog item that’s marked with inline render type, the requester can fill the item and its options within the Virtual Agent conversation.

For example, a requester can fill a form inline in the Virtual Agent conversation and submit the item.

![Inline request of a catalog item](../image/inline-catalog-request-va.png "Inline request of a catalog item")

![Inline request of a catalog item](../image/inline-catalog-request-va-a.png "Inline request of a catalog item")

![Inline request of a catalog item](../image/inline-catalog-request-va-b.png "Inline request of a catalog item")

## Catalog item request using a pop-up render type

A user can submit a catalog item request as a pop-up for items, which are not conversational. In a pop-up, Virtual Agent provides a link for the user to submit the request in a pop-up without navigating to a new tab. A non-conversational catalog item can be rendered as a pop-up only if it does not have any Custom, Custom with label, or UI Page variables.

**Note:** If you do not want to render your Virtual Agent conversation as a pop-up, set the **glide.sc.va.render\_type.legacy** property to true, which renders all non-conversational catalog items in the configured portal in a new tab.

![Virtual Agent rendered as a popup](../image/va-popup-catalog.png)

## Catalog item request using a window render type

A user can submit a catalog item request in a window. In a window, Virtual Agent provides a link for the user to submit the request in the Service Portal defined in the **sn\_itsm\_va.com.snc.itsm.virtualagent.portal\_url** property. A non-conversational item is rendered as a window if it has a Custom, Custom with label, or UI Page variable.

A catalog item is rendered as a window if it is of the following types:

-   Content Item
-   Order Guide
-   Wizard Launcher
-   Standard Change Template

Users can submit a request in a Virtual Agent conversation.
