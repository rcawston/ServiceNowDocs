# Creating a Service Catalog Wizard

Service Catalog wizards help you to create wizard like, multi-step experiences.

## Before you begin

Service Catalog wizards are especially useful when the input required is huge and complex since the wizard offers a step-by-step experience for the requester and also provides a side panel to provide contextual help. A visa application is a good example where Service Catalog wizards could be used as the data needs to be presented in steps such as Personal details, Education details, and so on.

Pre-requisites for creating Service Catalog wizards:

-   Ensure that you have either a composite record producer, or a record producer set up. For more information, see [Create a record producer](t_DefRecProdInSCat.md).
-   The **Save options** field must have the value **Save in destination** in the composite record producer or record producer to enable the wizard to create records.
-   The **Allow edit** option should be selected on the composite record producer or record producer form so that records are editable in the wizard.

Role required: wizard\_admin, or admin

## About this task

The Service Catalog Wizard is available as a component in UI Builder \(UIB\). You can use it to create guided experiences backed by composite record producers or record producers. You can create multi-step wizard experiences using Service Catalog Wizard.

Service Catalog Wizards are used in these modes:

-   **Normal** mode: To create records in the table configured in the record producer, or the composite record producer associated with the wizard.
-   **Template** mode: To create a template where admins can predefine some data and provide guardrails to fine-tune and personalize the creation of records.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Service Catalog Wizards** &gt; **Maintain Wizards**, and click **New** to create a new wizard.

2.  On the form, fill in the fields.
