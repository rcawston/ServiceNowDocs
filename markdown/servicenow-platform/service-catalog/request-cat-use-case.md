# Service Catalog and CSDM tables

Service Catalog manages and uses CSDM tables. Several ServiceNow products benefit from and add value to Service Catalog.

## CSDM tables managed by the Service Catalog

The Service Catalog primarily manages business services in the Sell/Consume domain. Technical Services are also viewed from the Operate domain of Event Management.

The Service Catalog manages the Catalog Item table \[sc\_cat\_item\]. The Catalog Item table creates requests in Request Management. The requests usually have an automated, semi-automated, or business workflow for fulfilling the request, which can consist of approvals and tasks. When part of Service Portfolio Management, the CIs are associated with service offerings. When you link a catalog item, you can track request activity for all catalog items associated with a service offering. An offering can have multiple catalog items.

The CIs can include:

-   PC Hardware Item \(pc\_hardware\_cat\_item\): Submits hardware asset requests included in Asset Management workflows.
-   PC Software Item \(pc\_software\_cat\_item\): Submits software asset requests included in Asset Management workflows.
-   Record Producer \(sc\_cat\_item\_producer\): Submits requests or generates records other than Request Management tables for services that aren't serviced by Request Management \(for example, HR Cases, Facilities Requests, or Legal Requests\).

## CSDM tables used by the Service Catalog

1.  Configuration Item tables \[cmdb\_ci\*\]
2.  Service Offering table \[sc\_cat\_item\_subscribe\]
3.  Application Service table \[cmdb\_ci\_service\_discovered\]
