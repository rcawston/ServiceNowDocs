# Define filters for My Requests

Define request filters to filter incidents, requests, or tasks under the **Self-Service** &gt; **My Requests** module in ServiceNow AI Platform, the **My Requests** widget in Service Portal, and the My Requests applet in the Now® Mobile app.

## Before you begin

Role required: catalog\_admin or admin

Since the My Request Filter \[request\_filter\] table has been reparented to the Filter \[sys\_filter\] table, a few fields from the My Request Filter table have been migrated to fields in the Filter table. The **Short Description** field from the My Request Filter table has been migrated to the **Title** field in the Filter table. The **Table Name** field from the My Request Filter table has been migrated to the **Table** field in the Filter table.

**Note:** If the My Request Filter form is modified, the form still displays the **Short Description** and **Table Name** fields that are no longer valid. Delete these invalid fields from the form and add the **Title** and **Table** fields to the form.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Service Catalog** &gt; **Catalog Administration** &gt; **My Request Filter**.

2.  On the form, fill the fields.
