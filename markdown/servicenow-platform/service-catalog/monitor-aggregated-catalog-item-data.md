# Monitoring aggregated catalog item data

Monitor aggregated catalog item data like fulfillment automation coverage, translation coverage, and conversational coverage using the Service Catalog Overview dashboard.

## Aggregated catalog item data graphs

You can access the aggregated catalog item data graphs in the Service Catalog Overview dashboard by navigating to **All &gt; Service Catalog &gt; Service Catalog Overview** if you have the catalog\_admin role.

The Catalog item translation coverage graph is displayed only if you have enabled the Localization framework. For more information, see [Localization Framework](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/localization-framework/localization-framework-landing.md).
