# Modifications in the delivery screen

In the final checkout step, a summary screen provides a list of all items and services ordered.

**Warning:** Modifying the Order Status or Summary screen requires advanced scripting and a knowledge of [Jelly](../../api-reference/scripts/r_JellyTags.md). Also, the upgrade process skips updates to the summary screen after a customization. With these constraints in mind, you can modify the summary screen by editing the **com.glideapp.servicecatalog\_checkout\_view** UI page.

## Requester search results

After you enable the two-step checkout process, the Requested for field appears on the Request form.

The Requested for field references the User `[sys_user]` table and has an auto-complete feature. Two service catalog properties \(**Service Catalog** &gt; **Catalog Administration** &gt; **Properties**\) enable an administrator to add columns to the search results for this field and to order the list by one of the columns.
