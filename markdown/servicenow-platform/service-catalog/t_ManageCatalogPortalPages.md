# Multiple service catalogs setup

Multiple service catalogs enable your organization to offer different sets of services to different teams within the organization, such as IT services, human resources, and facilities management.

Administrators and catalog administrators can define and manage multiple service catalogs. End users can access multiple catalogs from a single homepage, can search across all catalogs, or can search directly within each catalog.

## Enabling access for catalogs

You can enable read access to the catalogs by applying the rule **read ACL** on Catalog \(sc\_catalog\) table. See [Access Control Rules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/access-control/access-control-rules.md) for more information.

## Manage items in a catalog

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Manage catalog portal pages

Using Service Catalog, you can create and manage multiple portal pages for a catalog.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

### About this task

A catalog portal page provides a [homepage](c_ManagingTheHomepageForACatalog.md) for a specific catalog. You can use portal pages to create different catalog views for different user groups. Each portal page accesses the same catalog content and presents that content in different ways.

Catalog portal page details include the owner, title, and view to use for that page.

### Procedure

1.  The Catalog Portal Pages related list shows portal pages available for that catalog.

    Each catalog has a default page, created automatically when the catalog is created.

2.  Select an appropriate action:

    -   Click **New** to create a new portal page.
    -   Click **Edit** to select another portal page for the catalog.
    -   Select a portal page to view and edit details for that page.
