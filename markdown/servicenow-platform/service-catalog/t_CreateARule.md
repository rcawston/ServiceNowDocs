# Create an order guide rule to add a catalog item

You can add a catalog item to an order guide using specific rules.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

Order guide rules define conditions that must be met for a specific item to be included in an order. For example, a New Employee Hire order guide rule can state that if the new employee job title is CTO or Director, and the department is IT, then add an executive desktop item to the order.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Catalog** &gt; **Catalog Definition** &gt; **Order Guides**.

2.  Open an order guide.

3.  In the **Rule base** related list, click **New**.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.
