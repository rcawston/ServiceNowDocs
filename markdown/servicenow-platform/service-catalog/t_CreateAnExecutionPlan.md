## Add catalog item variables to a task

You can add variables of a catalog item to a task to specify information about the requested catalog item.

### Before you begin

### About this task

For example, when a user requests a laptop, the fulfillment group can need to know what screen size and how much memory to order.

Each catalog item can contain one or more variables for gathering information from the user who requests the item. Assuming that the relevant catalog items have been associated to the execution plan, you can associate these variables to the specific created tasks that need the information.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Catalog** &gt; **Catalog Administration** &gt; **Execution Plans**.

2.  Open an execution plan.

3.  In the Execution Plan Tasks related list, open a task.

    Ensure that the form shows the Plan view. If not, right-click the header bar and select **View** &gt; **Plan**.

4.  Go to the Available Variables related list and click **Edit**.

5.  Use the slushbucket to select the variables that are appropriate for the task.

    Consider all the types of catalog items that could use this execution plan, and select all the variables that can be assigned to them.

6.  Click **Save** to associate these variables to the execution plan task, making them accessible.
