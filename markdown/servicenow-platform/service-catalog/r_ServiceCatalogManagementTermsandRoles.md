# Service Catalog terms and roles

The Service Catalog application uses these roles to manage different aspects of the application.

## Service Catalog terms

-   **Execution Plans**

    Define how something gets delivered. For example, a PDA could go through procurement / activation / and installation of the desktop software.

-   **Execution Plan Tasks**

    Plan Tasks represent a step in the Execution Plan, are associated with a Fulfillment Group, and have an approximate duration.

-   **Fulfillment Groups**

    Fulfillment Groups work execution tasks. For example, one group can activate a cell phone while a different group installs the desktop software.

-   **Tickets**

    Tickets represent work done by Fulfillment Groups as part of an Execution Plan.

-   Dynamic and advanced reference qualifiers in the Additional details tab of a question
-   Variable attributes
-   Scriptable default values
-   Availability sections
-   Catalog client scripts

Also, the catalog builder developer can create a new catalog item without using a template. This behavior is managed by the **glide.sc.builder.allow\_create\_from\_scratch** property, which is enabled by default. If the property is turned off, the catalog builder developer must use a template to create a new catalog item.
