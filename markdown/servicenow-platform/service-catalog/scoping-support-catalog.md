# Service Catalog scoping

Scoping support is available to define the limits of entities in Service Catalog.

-   A catalog can have categories from different scopes.
-   A category can only be in the same scope as its parent category.
-   You can associate a catalog item with categories of a different scope.
-   Catalog items can contain variable sets from a different scope.
-   Variables can only be in the same scope as the catalog item or variable set.
-   Catalog UI policies can only be in the same scope as the catalog item or variable set.
-   Catalog client scripts can only be in the same scope as the catalog item or variable set.
-   Catalog data lookup can only be in the same scope as the catalog item or variable set.
-   The rule base of an order guide can have items from different scopes.
-   The scope of the record producer and the target table should be the same.

-   **[Scriptable service catalog variables](c_ScriptableServiceCatalogVariables.md)**  
You can use scripting to reference any request item variable from a table in scoped and non-scoped environment.
