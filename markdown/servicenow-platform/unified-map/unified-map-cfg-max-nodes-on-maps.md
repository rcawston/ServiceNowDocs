# Configure how many nodes can appear on a map

Configure the maximum number of nodes that can be loaded when a map in this workspace opens. These are general settings that only sn\_cmdb\_admin can configure.

## Before you begin

Set the application scope in your instance to **CMDB Workspace**.

Role required: sn\_cmdb\_admin

## About this task

Admins can set the maximum node count using the **unifiedmap.map\_search.max\_nodes** property in the workspace-specific \[sn\_cmdb\_ws\_config\_property\] table.

These workspace-specific configuration settings affect all users of the CMDB Unified Map page. The settings do not affect other copies of the Unified Map template.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** and then, in the filter box in the main navigation bar, enter `sn_cmdb_ws_config_property.list`.

2.  Select the **unifiedmap.map\_search.max\_nodes** property.

3.  Select **New** or select the configuration identifier to update and then fill in the form.
