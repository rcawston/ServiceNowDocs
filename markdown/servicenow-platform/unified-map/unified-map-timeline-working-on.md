# Viewing related items on the Unified Map timeline

The timeline indicates related items like incidents, problems, and changes over a specified period of time for the selected CI. You can use the timeline to visualize the history of changes to a CI and how they affect the topology of the CMDB.

## Viewing related items

-   When you first open a map, CIs and relationships appear as they are at the current moment in time. When you select a CI on the map, the timeline displays related items for the CI.

-   You can drag the map time marker \(A in the image\) on the timeline to specify the end date \(the map time\) for data that should appear on the map and on the timeline. The default map time is "now", but you can specify a particular date or drag the marker to a date.

-   The map and the timeline are synchronized. The map shows the selected CI and its connections as they existed \(based on the creation date of nodes\) at the specified map time. The timeline displays markers \(B in the image\) to indicate related items that happened at or before map time.

    ![The timeline indicates all related items for the CI within a time span that happened before the specified map time.](../image/um-timeline.png)

-   You can also specify the overall time span \(C in the image\) of the timeline view.

-   CIs that were created after the map time don't appear on the timeline and don't affect items on the timeline.
-   Multiple related items on the same date are indicated by a badge that shows the count of related items.
