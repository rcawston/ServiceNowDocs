# Configure CIs to appear based on life cycle stage value

By default, only CIs for which **Life cycle stage** is **Operational** or empty appear on maps. You can configure the map to display CIs with other **Life cycle stage** values. These are general settings that only sn\_cmdb\_admin can configure.

## Before you begin

Set the application scope in your instance to **CMDB Workspace**.

Role required: sn\_cmdb\_admin

## About this task

-   By default, non-operational CIs are filtered out and do not appear on maps.
-   Search results don't include CIs that are filtered out based on operational state.
-   The **Open Map** button \(for viewing details\) on the CI form isn't available for CIs that are filtered out based on operational state.

These workspace-specific configuration settings affect all users of the CMDB Unified Map page. The settings do not affect other copies of the Unified Map template. Non-admin users can customize some aspects of their personal experience with Unified Map, but can't configure instance-wide workspace-specific settings.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** and then, in the **Filter** box in the main navigation bar, enter `sn_cmdb_ws_operational_lifecycle_for_unified_map.list` to open the **Operational life cycle modes** table.

2.  Select the list of selected live cycle stage values.

    For Unified Map, the default list of selected live cycle stage values is named **CMDB Workspace Unified Map View**.

    1.  Unlock the **Life cycle list** field and then select the Edit multiple icon ![](../image/icon-edit-multiple.png).

    2.  In the Edit Members pop-up, move the life cycle stage values for CIs that should appear on maps into the **Selected life cycle stages** list and then select **Save**.

    3.  On the record form, select **Update** or **Save**.

    -   The updated settings appear in the appropriate related list on the Configuration identifier form, as described in [Configuring Unified Map — admin settings](administer-unified-map.md). The updated list of life cycle stage values is added to the **CMDB Workspace Unified Map View** life cycle mode on the **Operational life cycle modes** related list for the affected configuration identifier.
    -   You can also perform this operation from the **Operational life cycle modes** related list.
