# Configure how to display related items on the map

Add related items categories, specify which information should appear on cards on the Unified Map **Related items** panel, and specify how related items \(events\) appear on the timeline and on badges. These are general settings that only sn\_cmdb\_admin can configure.

## Before you begin

Set the application scope in your instance to **CMDB Workspace**.

Role required: sn\_cmdb\_admin

## About this task

These workspace-specific configuration settings affect all users of the CMDB Unified Map page. The settings do not affect other copies of the Unified Map template. Configuration settings that non-admin users can specify are described in [Configure the Related items panel](unified-map-configure-rel-items.md).

Related items are grouped by category in the **Related items** panel. Related items also appear for CI badges on the map and timeline.

The \[sn\_cmdb\_ws\_node\_map\_related\_item\] table contains the settings that determine which related items and associated details appear. By default, common categories of related items, such as active incidents and other events for example, are configured to appear. You add or modify records to globally manage related items on maps.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** and then, in the search box on the main navigation bar, enter `sn_cmdb_ws_node_map_related_item.list` to open the Node Map Related Item table.

2.  Select an existing record or select **New** and then fill in the form.
