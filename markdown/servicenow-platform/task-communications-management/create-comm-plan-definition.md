Define a communication task for the plan.

Define a communication task for a communication plan. When a plan gets attached to a table, the tasks related to the plan need to be executed to resolve the issue. You can associate multiple tasks with a communication plan.
-   **[Define a communication channel](create-comm-channel-definition.md)**  
Define a communication channel for each communication task to determine which mode of communication to use for the task when a plan is attached to a table.
-   **[Define a communication contact](create-comm-contact-definition.md)**  
Define the recipients of a particular plan to determine the target audience involved in each communication task and the responsibilities the recipients are expected to handle. A notification for a task is sent to all individuals specified for that task.
