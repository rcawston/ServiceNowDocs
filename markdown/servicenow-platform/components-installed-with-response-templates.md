# Components installed with response templates

Several types of components are installed with activation of the Templated Responses \(com.sn\_templated\_snip\) plugin, including tables and user roles.

**Note:** The Application Files table lists the components that are installed with this application. For instructions on how to access this table, see [Find components installed with an application](../platform-administration/find-components.md).

Demo data is available for this feature.

## Roles installed

By default, the following HR roles contain the following response template roles.

**Note:** The Templated Responses \[com.sn\_templated\_snip\] plugin activates the sn\_templated\_snip.min\_admin\_count system property \[sys\_properties.list\]. This property prevents you from deleting your only Response Template admin user by requiring a minimum number \(default is two\) of active users with this role.
