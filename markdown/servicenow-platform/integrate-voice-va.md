# Integrating ServiceNow Voice with Virtual Agent

The ServiceNow Voice for Virtual Agent application provides seamless interactive voice response \(IVR\) and calling experiences for your customers and agents when integrated with a Contact Center In Australia release, we have Amazon Connect, a pre-built adapter integrating the ServiceNow Voice with Virtual Agent to provide the robust capabilities of the Virtual Agent application.

## Example workflow

The following example workflow shows the use of ServiceNow Voice for Virtual Agent application in resolving a customer issue.

-   A customer is in an IVR call using the ServiceNow Voice for Virtual Agent application.
-   The ServiceNow Voice for Virtual Agent application identifies the customer and starts an interaction.
-   A welcome message is read out to the customer including announcements if any.
-   Based on customer identification, the ServiceNow Voice for Virtual Agent application addresses the call.
    -   If the caller is identified as an existing customer who has a customer contact or consumer record with the phone number details available in the ServiceNow Voice for Virtual Agent application, a personal greeting is read to the caller and the automated interactions with Virtual Agent conversations are made available.
    -   If the caller is not identified, the caller is presented with the guest topics and the live agent topic. The caller can select the live agent topic to route themselves to a live agent.
-   The ServiceNow Voice for Virtual Agent application identifies the customer intent using automated interactions, and the Virtual Agent conversations guide customers to complete the workflow, including changing records, passwords or hearing about a case status.

    **Note:** This step in the flow applies only when the caller is an existing customer.
