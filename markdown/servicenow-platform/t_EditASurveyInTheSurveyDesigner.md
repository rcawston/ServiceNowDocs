# Edit a survey in the survey designer

You can modify surveys using the survey designer.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin or survey\_admin

## About this task

You can edit a survey even after it has been distributed, with the following results.

-   Added questions are available only on surveys that are distributed after this change.
-   Changes to existing questions are immediately available to users before the survey is submitted or during the retake period. This includes changes to the answers, such as additional choices or changes to the data type.
-   Deleted questions are also deleted from the distributed surveys in user queues.

**Note:** You can only edit a survey that has the same application scope as that of your current session.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Survey** &gt; **Survey Designer**.

2.  Point to the menu icon in the survey header bar, and select **Load Survey**.

3.  Select a survey from the list and modify it as needed.

    **Note:** Update the **Sample metric** field only after you complete all other survey configurations. If you need to modify the survey configuration, first remove the question from the **Sample metric** field. After you finish making changes, add the question back to the field.

4.  Point to the menu icon in the survey header bar, and select **Save** or **Save and Publish**.

    When you publish the edited survey, the system generates survey instances for any associated survey users.
