</td></tr><tr><td>

Randomize answers

</td><td>

Check box for displaying answer options in a random order. Answer preference is sometimes influenced by the order in which options appear, which can result in biased results. Randomizing options can help prevent this bias. **Note:** Randomizing options for certain questions may make those questions confusing for users. In general, only randomize options that do not follow a logical order.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Positive indicator

</td><td>

Setting that determines whether smaller or larger numerical values equate to a good score in result calculations. Select **Low values** if smaller numerical values are better, such as for a question that measures the number of incidents for a vendor. Select **High values** if larger numerical values are better, such as for a question that measures user satisfaction on a scale of one to five.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Source Field

</td><td>

Source table field that appears as a dynamic value for the question in a triggered survey. When this field value is selected, a **$\{param\}** placeholder is added at the end of the question label.**Note:** You can move this placeholder anywhere in the question label.

 When a user takes the survey, the question with dynamic value is included in the survey instance and **$\{param\}** placeholder is replaced with the source field value.

 If the record table specified in the trigger condition does not match the source table specified for the survey, or if the system fails to get the dynamic value from the source record, the **$\{param\}** placeholder is not replaced by any value and is displayed as is in the question.

For example, if the survey is triggered from a **PRB** record and the survey question is configured with a dynamic value from **Incident**, the **$\{param\}** placeholder in the survey question label is not replaced by any dynamic value and is displayed as is.When survey questions are translated to other languages by a survey admin, the **$\{param\}**placeholder should not be translated.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Options for a question with a data type of **Choice** or **Scale**. The system automatically adds text and values that you can edit for each option. You must have at least two options, and each option must have a unique value.Click the **+** icon to add an option, or click the **X** icon to delete an option. By default, the system arranges options in the order established by their values. To change the order, drag and drop the options.

**Note:** Value numbers also contribute to the calculations of survey response scores, which can be used by advanced survey administrators.
