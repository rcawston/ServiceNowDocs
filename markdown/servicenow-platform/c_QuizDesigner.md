# Quiz designer

The quiz designer provides a single interface that users with the assessment\_admin role can use to create, edit, and distribute quizzes.

You can also use it to edit existing quizzes and change scoring parameters.

Alternatively, you can use the modules of the [assessment engine](r_Assessments.md) to create and edit the records that make up a quiz. All quiz records are stored in assessment tables and displayed in Quiz views of those tables. For details, see [Create quizzes with forms](c_CreateQuizzesWithForms.md).

## Tools on the Quiz Designer

The quiz designer includes a design canvas, a header bar, and many controls that you can use to create quizzes.

To open the quiz designer, navigate to **Quizzes** &gt; **Quiz Designer**.

The designer contains the following elements:

-   **Controls** tab

-   **Categories** tab
-   **Header** bar
