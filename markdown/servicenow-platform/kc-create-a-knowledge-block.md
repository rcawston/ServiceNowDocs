# Create a knowledge block in the Knowledge Center

Create a knowledge block to define a reusable piece of content that can be inserted into knowledge articles in a knowledge base. The knowledge block is secured by user criteria, which controls what users, groups, and roles, can read the content in an article, allowing display of content that is relevant only to them.

## Before you begin

-   -   You must have 'contribute' access to the knowledge base.
-   Confirm that the knowledge blocks feature is enabled for the knowledge base that the article is in. For more information, see [Enable knowledge blocks in the Knowledge Center](kc-enable-knowledge-blocks.md)

Role required: knowledge

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Knowledge** &gt; **Knowledge Center**

2.  Check whether a knowledge block on this subject is already available.

    1.  Navigate to **Lists** &gt; **Knowledge Blocks** &gt; **All**.

    2.  Set a filter to search for possible matching knowledge blocks.

        -   Select a column header. Based on the data type included in the column, in the Filter section, select the filter options or enter the filter conditions you want to apply. For example, for the workflow column, you can select the following states:
            -   Draft
            -   Review
            -   Scheduled for publish
            -   Published
            -   Pending retirement
            -   Retired
            -   Outdated
        -   Select the show filter panel icon, and select **Advanced view**. In the Advanced view dialog box, specify conditions in the **All of these conditions must be met** field and select **Update**.
3.  Select **New** to create a knowledge block.

4.  On the Knowledge Block form, fill in the fields.
