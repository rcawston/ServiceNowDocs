Name

</td><td>

\[Read-Only\] Assessable record name based on the [Select a field as the table display value](../platform-administration/t_SelectTheDisplayValue.md) of the source record. The name appears on assessment questionnaires.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Source

</td><td>

\[Read-Only\] Source record the assessable record is linked to. The **Source** reflects the table name and source record display value.

Check box that, when selected, creates a Live Feed group for the assessable record, which appears on the scorecard. If you clear the check box after a Live Feed group has been created, the system deletes the Live Feed group and all its messages.
