# Catalog Conversational Coverage

ServiceNow® Catalog Conversational Coverage provides a dashboard to view a high-level overview of the conversational and non-conversational catalog items.

You can view this information in the Conversational catalog overview dashboard. The dashboard displays a graphical representation of various reports, such as the number of conversational and non-conversational catalog items, reasons that make the items non-conversational, and popular request channels. It also shows a list of the catalog items, their conversational status, and other details.

**Note:** You can access the conversational catalog dashboard only if you’ve installed the Now Assist in Conversational Catalog Request app. Conversational catalog dashboard can’t be installed separately as it's bundled with Now Assist in Conversational Catalog Request.

Drilling down the catalog items, you can view the details, for example, whether they’re conversational or non-conversational and why the items are non-conversational. Explore the potential suggestions for non-conversational items that might help you make items conversational.

If you have any of the following roles, you can view the dashboard:

-   Catalog administrator \[catalog\_admin\]
-   Catalog manager \[catalog\_manager\]
-   Catalog editor \[catalog\_editor\]

To access and view the dashboard, you must install and activate the Catalog Conversational Experience plugin \(sn\_catalog\_con\_cov\). You can find the plugin in the ServiceNow® Store.

**Note:** If you've installed Now Assist for conversation request submission plugin, you get the Catalog Conversational Experience plugin \(sn\_catalog\_con\_cov\) by default.

The **Update catalog items conversational status** scheduled job pulls conversational data of catalog items. This scheduled job updates the reasons for the catalog items. The scheduled job runs once in three days automatically. But to get the latest data when you need, run this job manually.

## Catalog item conversational details page overview

View the details page for your catalog item. If your item is non-conversational, view why your catalog item isn’t conversational and review the suggestions to know what you can do to make the item conversational.

You can view this page only if you have any of the following roles:

-   Catalog administrator \[catalog\_admin\]
-   Catalog manager \[catalog\_manager\]
-   Catalog editor \[catalog\_editor\]
-   Catalog builder editor \[catalog\_builder\_editor\]

**Note:** The catalog manager, catalog editor, and catalog builder editor can view the details page only if they have edit access to the catalog item.

The page displays the following information related to conversational or non-conversational catalog items:

-   Name of the catalog item
-   Conversational status and render type
-   Date and time when the catalog item was last updated
-   The **Conversational readiness** and **Item details** tabs

    The **Conversational readiness** tab shows the Recommended Actions and the Required Actions \(If required actions are available\) sections. The recommended actions are useful to improve your catalog item for conversational channel. Required actions are useful to make your catalog items conversational.

    The **Item details** tab shows the details, such as a short description, description, and image of the item if available.

    **Note:** If any action is required to make a catalog item conversational, the action is displayed in the Required Actions section.


After going over the recommendations to make the item conversational, select **Edit in advanced view** if you want to make changes. The catalog item opens in the ServiceNow AI Platform for editing.

**Note:**

-   Only the catalog admin, catalog manager, and catalog editor can view the **Edit in advanced view** button.
-   If you're viewing a catalog item that's in the checked out state, you view its data that corresponds to the published version of the item. Any changes to the draft of the catalog item won’t be reflected here until it’s published.

By default, all catalog items are conversational. To make the catalog item non-conversational, select the **Make the item non-conversational in VA** check box in ServiceNow AI Platform®.

**Important:** Select the **Turn off Now Assist \(LLM\)** check box if you don't want the data of the catalog item \(and user responses\) to be sent to the LLM for security reasons, in case the catalog item contains sensitive data. Selecting this option ensures that this item will invoke the NLU topic block if it’s compatible, otherwise, it will show up either as a pop-up or as a link depending on the item's configuration. Restrictions on the NLU topic block are stricter than the LLM topic block and therefore a conversational item in the LLM topic block \(as shown in the Conversational Catalog Overview dashboard\) may not be conversational in the NLU topic block.
