# Create a survey category in a survey

You can modify an existing survey to add one or more survey categories.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin or survey\_admin

## About this task

Only one category is required for each survey, but you can add additional categories as needed.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Survey** &gt; **View Surveys**.

2.  Open a survey definition.

3.  In the **Metric Categories** related list, open a category or click **New**.

    Each survey category is stored as a record on the Metric Category \[asmt\_metric\_category\] table with a modified view for survey use.

4.  Enter the survey category name and description.

    The category name appears on questionnaires when either of the following is true.

    -   There is more than one category for the survey.
    -   There is only one category and its name is different from the survey definition name. If you create a survey using the survey creator, the category name is the same as the survey definition name.
5.  Right-click the form header and click **Save**.

    The **Assessment Metrics** and **Users** related lists appear.

6.  Click **Update**.
