# Geolocation

The geolocation feature uses Google Maps to track users, plan efficient routes between locations, and assist in finding accurate travel times for applications that require this information, such as Work Management.

The system locates users from latitude and longitude information provided by their mobile devices or browsers. Tracking the location of certain users can improve business processes such as the completion of work order tasks. For example, in work management geolocation, the system updates an agent's position each time that agent updates a task record. When the system updates an agent's location frequently, agents and dispatchers can use features like auto-routing to create efficient schedules.

Geolocation features can be configured by users with the admin role.
