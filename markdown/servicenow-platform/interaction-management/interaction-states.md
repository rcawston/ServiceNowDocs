# Interaction states

Configure the behavior of an interaction by determining the routine behavior for each state that the interaction goes through during the life cycle.

## Interaction framework

Configure each of the following interaction components to determine the behavior and life cycle.

-   Lists: Configure the interaction list view. You can also extend the interaction table. For more information about configuring lists, see [Configuring lists on the ServiceNow AI Platform®](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/list-administration/c_ListConfiguration.md).
-   Forms: Configure the form view to tailor interactions for each application. For more information about configuring forms, see [Configuring forms on the ServiceNow AI Platform®](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/basic-form-administration.md).

## Interaction states

States determine the behavior for interactions. For each state of the interaction life cycle, you determine which routine actions to perform. For example, the **On Created** state would have a script that creates an interaction and then adds the end user as the 'opened for'. The script then sends a message to the end user to let them know that the interaction has been opened.
