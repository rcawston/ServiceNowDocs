Wrap up duration

</td><td>

If using the Interaction wrap up feature, the system administrator can configure the Interaction form and add the **Wrap up duration** field.

 This field records the length of time that the Interaction record spends in the Wrap Up state. This is a read-only field. If a duration is not calculated, this field is set to 0.

 Duration is calculated as the time an interaction is in the Wrap Up state before moving to either Closed Complete or Closed Abandoned.

**Note:** If an agent closes the tab and ends the interaction, the wrap up duration is recorded as 0 seconds.

</td></tr><tr><td>

System wrap up

</td><td>

If using the Interaction wrap up feature, the system administrator can configure the Interaction form and add the **System wrap up** field.

 The system determines if the interaction wrap up was performed manually by an agent \(by clicking **End Wrap Up**\) or automatically by the system and sets this field accordingly.

-   Set to **True** when automatic wrap up is enabled and the system moves an interaction from the Wrap Up state to either Closed Complete or Closed Abandoned at the end of the wrap up duration.
-   Set to **False** when an agent manually wraps up an interaction.

 The default value for this field is false.
