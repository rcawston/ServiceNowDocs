# Activate Connect Support

The Connect Support plugin \(com.glide.connect.support\) is no longer available.

## Before you begin

**Important:**

This plugin is no longer available. In Paris and future releases, Connect Support no longer receives enhancements or non-priority bug fixes. Consider migrating to ServiceNow® Advanced Work Assignment and Agent Chat in workspace to automatically assign chat requests and other work items to agents. For details, see [Migrate from Connect Support to Advanced Work Assignment and Agent Chat](../../conversational-interfaces/advanced-work-assignment/migrate-from-connect-support.md).

If you are currently using the legacy chat feature to provide help desk support, close any open help desk chats before activating Connect Support. Legacy chat and Connect Support should not be used concurrently. When you activate Connect Support, the system automatically sets the state of all Chat Queue Entry \[chat\_queue\_entry\] records to **Closed Complete**. This ends any open help desk chats. For more information, see [Migrate from legacy chat to Connect Support](t_ConnectSupportMigration.md).

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  Find the plugin using the filter criteria and search bar.

    You can search for the plugin by its name or ID. If you cannot find a plugin, you might have to request it from ServiceNow personnel.

3.  Select **Install** to start the installation process.

    **Note:** When domain separation and delegated admin are enabled in an instance, the administrative user must be in the **global** domain. Otherwise, the following error appears: `Application installation is unavailable because another operation is running: Plugin Activation for <plugin name>.`

    You will see a message after installation is completed. For information about the components installed with a plugin, see [Find components installed with an application](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/australia-platform-administration/page/administer/plugins/task/find-components.html).
