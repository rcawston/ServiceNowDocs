# Connect overlay

The Connect overlay appears over the standard user interface. It consists of the Connect sidebar, which is the primary interface for Connect Chat and Connect Support, and any Connect mini windows that are open. Each mini window contains a header, a conversation area, and a message field.

**Note:** An administrator can [disable](t_DisableTheCollaborationOverlay.md) the Connect overlay so users can only use the Connect workspace, a full-screen interface with additional Connect tools.

## Connect sidebar

The Connect sidebar is the primary interface for Connect Chat and Connect Support. It lists your conversations and provides access to create conversations.

The sidebar is collapsed by default. Click the toggle Connect sidebar icon \(![Toggle Connect sidebar icon](../image/IconUI16ToggleConnectSidebar.png)\) in the banner frame to expand or collapse the sidebar, which appears on the right edge of the interface.

### Connect Chat

The chat view of the sidebar is available to all users. If Connect Support is enabled, users must click the chat tab of the sidebar, which is represented by a speech bubble icon. If Connect Support is not enabled, there are no tabs in the sidebar and the chat view displays by default.

The chat view of the sidebar lists all your current Connect Chat conversations. It also contains a filter tool and a button to create conversations.

If you have unread messages in a conversation, a number appears by the conversation in the sidebar. Point to a conversation and click the **x** icon to remove the conversation from the sidebar.

### Connect Support

The support view of the sidebar is available when Connect Support is activated. The support view is visible only to users who are agents for at least one support queue. Users must click the support tab of the sidebar, which is represented by a headset icon.

The support view displays **Queues** to which you belong. It also displays your open support conversations under **Cases**.

If you have unread messages in a conversation, a number appears by the conversation in the sidebar.

## Connect mini windows

When you open a Connect Chat or Connect Support conversation in the Connect overlay, it opens in a Connect mini window. Each mini window contains a header, a conversation area, and a message field.

Several icons appear in the mini window header and by the message field.

**Note:** The icons you see for each conversation depend on the conversation type and other conditions.
