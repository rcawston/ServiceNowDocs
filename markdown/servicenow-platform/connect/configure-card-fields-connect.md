    For more information on creating a form view, see [Create and delete views](../../platform-user-interface/create-delete-view.md) .

    You cannot remove the Author or the Updated fields from the card regardless of whether they are on the view or not. The card always shows the Short Description field in the top even if it is in a different order in the list.

5.  Choose the fields that you want to display on the Connect card and select Save.![Screen shot of Configuring Incidents List](../image/configure-card-screenshot3.png)

6.  Validate that the card displays the fields in a Connect Chat conversation.
