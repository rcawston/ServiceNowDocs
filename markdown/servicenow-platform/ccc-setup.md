# Setting up ServiceNow Voice

Enable ServiceNow Voice and integrate it with a third-party phone system such as Amazon Connect.

When you set up a third-party phone system and integrate it with the ServiceNow instance, an agent can accept an incoming call or make an outbound call from the ServiceNow instance using the integrated softphone. This experience is based on the configurations made within the third-party phone system.

## Get started with Voice

1.  Procure a license for a ServiceNow application, such as ITSM or CSM, which includes ServiceNow Voice.
2.  Install the ServiceNow Voice applications in ServiceNow® Store. For information about this installation, see [Install ServiceNow Voice applications](install-ccc-apps.md).
3.  Sign up and create an account with a third-party phone system. By default, Amazon Connect is supported. For information about creating an Amazon Web Services \(AWS\) account, see the Amazon [documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/).
4.  Configure the framework for the third-party phone system within the ServiceNow instance. By default, the framework is supported for Amazon Connect. For information about this configuration, see [Integrate ServiceNow Voice with Amazon Connect](integrate-ccc-amazonconnect.md).
