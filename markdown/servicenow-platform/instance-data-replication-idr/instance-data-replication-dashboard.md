# Monitoring replication status in Instance Data Replication

Monitor the status of active producer and consumer replication sets, scheduled jobs, seeding requests, license usage, or scheduled replication through the Instance Data Replication \(IDR\) Monitoring Dashboard.

## Accessing the IDR Monitoring dashboard

Users with the admin or idr\_admin role can access the dashboard.

Access the IDR Monitoring dashboard in the following way:

-   Navigate to **Instance Data Replication** &gt; **Monitoring Dashboard**.
-   Choose one of the following: **IDR Overall Monitoring**, **IDR License and Usage SMv2**, or **Scheduled Replication** dashboard.

## IDR Overall Monitoring dashboard

The IDR Overall Monitoring dashboard monitors the following:

-   Active Producer Replication Sets
-   Active Consumer Replications Sets
-   Suite of IDR Scheduled Jobs
-   Producer Seeding Requests Within Last 7 Days
-   Consumer Seeding Requests Within Last 7 Days

-   **Active Producer Replication Sets**

    The Active Producer Replication Sets monitors your producer replication set status and reports the data lag time between your instance and the replication queue.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Name|Name of the producer replication set|
    |Replication Queue Reading Lag|Time between a record change on the producer instance and the moment that it’s sent over the outbound replication queue|
    |Status|Status of a replication set, either active or in error|
    |Status Message|Message that describes the error status|
    |Message Queue Version|Version of the Message Queue. Default is V2 \(Hermes\).|

-   **Active Consumer Replication Sets**

    Active Consumer Replication Sets monitors your consumer replication set status, reports the network lag time, and reports the data lag time between the producer instance and consumer instance.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Name|Name of the consumer replication set.|
    |Data Lag|Time between a record change on the producer instance and the moment that it’s recorded in the consumer instance.|
    |Network Lag|Time between a record change log in the outbound replication queue and the moment that it’s recorded in the consumer instance.|
    |Status|Status of a replication set, either active or in error.|
    |Status Message|Message that describes the error status.|
    |Message Queue Version|Version of the Message Queue. Default is V2 \(Hermes\).|

-   **Suite of IDR Scheduled Jobs**

    The suite of IDR scheduled jobs poll for data changes, requests, and check the health of your producer and consumer instances. You can monitor the following jobs:

    |Jobs|Description|
    |----|-----------|
    |Hermes Metrics Collection|Collects metrics related to the Hermes Messaging Service.|
    |Hermes Periodic Purge|Cleans obsolete cached data in the Hermes API.|
    |Hermes Topics Util|Synchronizes topics across Hermes clusters. Initially, topics are created in a single Hermes cluster. This job detects new topics and creates the same topics in the remaining Hermes clusters.|
    |IDRConsumerJob|Polls for record changes and seeding requests on the consumer instance in 15-second intervals.|
    |IDRDeltaConsumerJob|Beginning in the San Diego release, when a consumer instance subscribes to a producer instance that is outside the local datacenter, the IDRDeltaConsumerJob job is created on the producer instance. The function is the same as the IDRConsumerJob. The three-letter code denotes the datacenter location.|
    |IDRHermesDeltaConsumer|Polls for consumer record changes from the Hermes delta topic in 15-second intervals.|
    |IDRHeartBeatJob|Updates information about the health of every active producer or consumer set.|
    |IDRMetadataConsumerJob|Polls for metadata record changes on the consumer instance in 15-second intervals.|
    |IDRProducerJob|Polls for new, updated, or deleted records in the data replication queue for a producer instance in 15-second intervals.|
    |IDRSeedingProducerJob|Checks for new seeding requests coming from consumer instances.|

    **Note:** You can set when your IDR scheduled jobs run and configure a periodic trigger that specifies how often the job runs.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Name|Scheduled job name.|
    |Next Action|Date and time when the job next runs.|
    |Trigger type|Job that you can configure to run daily, weekly, monthly, periodically, once, on-demand, or business calendar start or end date. The trigger can repeat daily, hourly, by minute, or by second.|
    |Job ID|ID of the scheduled job.|
    |State|State of the job, for example, ready.|

-   **Producer Seeding Request Within Last 7 Days**

    You can monitor the status of a producer seeding request within the last seven days.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Replication Set|Producer set and the consumer set.|
    |Status|Status of the seeding request. The status can be completed, in progress, or failed.|
    |Start Time|Time that the seeding begins.|
    |End Time|Time that the seeding ends.|
    |Percent Complete|Percentage of the seeding request job that is complete.|

-   **Consumer Seeding Request Within Last 7 Days**

    You can monitor the status of a consumer seeding request within the last seven days.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Replication Set|Corresponding consumer set.|
    |Status|Status of the seeding request. The status can be completed, in progress, or failed.|
    |Start Time|Time that the seeding begins.|
    |End Time|Time that the seeding ends.|
    |Percent Complete|Percentage of the seeding request job that is complete.|

-   **IDR dashboard properties**
