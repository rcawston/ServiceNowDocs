# Manage consumer access to replication data in Instance Data Replication

Approve a consumer's request to access replication data in Instance Data Replication \(IDR\).

## Before you begin

Role required: admin, idr\_admin

## About this task

You can review consumer access requests for all of your producer replication sets or for a specific producer replication set. The administrators of consumer sets must apply for access before they can receive the replication data.

## Procedure

1.  On the producer instance, navigate to **Instance Data Replication** &gt; **Consumers Pending Approval**.

2.  Select the option for each consumer replication set that you want to approve.

3.  On the Actions on selected rows list, select **Approve**.

    The approved consumer sets start receiving the replicated data.

    **Note:** You can change the Consumer Approval Status to Denied to prevent the consumer from receiving the replicated data.

4.  Approve a consumer access request for a specific producer replication set.

    1.  On the producer instance, navigate to **Instance Data Replication** &gt; **Producer Replication Sets**.

    2.  Select the producer replication set where you want to approve consumer access.

    3.  Under Related Links, on the **Consumer Subscriptions** tab, select the option for the consumer replication set that you want to approve.

    4.  On the Actions on selected rows list, select **Approve**.

        The approved consumer set starts receiving replicated data.

        **Note:** You can change the Consumer Approval Status to Denied to prevent the consumer from receiving the replicated data.
