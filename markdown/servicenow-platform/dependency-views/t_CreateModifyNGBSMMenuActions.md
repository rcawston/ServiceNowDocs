# Create or modify Dependency Views menu actions

To modify an existing menu option, first you create a copy of the original menu action record, and then you modify the copy.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cmdb\_admin or admin

## About this task

This ensures that your instance can update the record normally during the upgrade process and allows you to quickly restore the original menu option, if necessary.

## Procedure

1.  To create a new menu option, navigate to **Dependency Views** &gt; **Map Menu Actions** and click **New**.

    Fill in the fields on the form, as appropriate. See the Menu Action form table.

2.  To modify an existing menu option, navigate to **Dependency Views** &gt; **Map Menu Actions**.

3.  Open the menu action you want to edit.

4.  Right-click in the header and click **Insert and Stay**.

    This step creates a duplicate copy of the menu action and leaves it open for editing.

5.  Change the name of the copied record to avoid confusion.

6.  Modify the form fields as necessary and save the record.

7.  Open the original record and disable it by clearing the **Active** check box.
