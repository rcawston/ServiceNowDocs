# Notify workflow activities

Notify workflow activities manage calls and SMS messages in Notify.

All Notify workflows that manage a phone call must run on the notify\_call table. Call-related Notify activities can be added only to workflows where the **Table** field value is **Notify Call \[notify\_call\]**.

You can identify if an outbound call was answered by a human or by an answering machine from within a Notify workflow by evaluating the **current.is\_human** variable, such as with an **If** workflow activity. This variable is set by the telephony provider when an outbound call is answered. This variable is always true for inbound calls.

**Note:** Do not add a **Timer** activity between multiple Notify activities that interact with active phone calls.

**Important:** When creating a Notify workflow, set the workflow **If condition matches** field to **-- None --**. Notify controls which workflow to run based on the configured number groups.
