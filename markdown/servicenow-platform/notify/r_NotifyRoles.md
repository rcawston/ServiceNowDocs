# Roles installed with Notify

Notify adds the following roles.

If you have created a new role, then you must add the new role to the corresponding deny ACL list to not allow user to access the Notify tables.

**Note:** Only the user with the Notify administrator \[notify\_admin\], and Notify viewer \[notify\_view\] roles can have access to Notify tables. The deny unless authenticated ACLs restrict access to the Notify tables for any unauthenticated role such as public role user.

To learn more about managing subscriptions, see [Managing per-user subscriptions in Subscription Management](../../platform-administration/managing-user-subscriptions-v2.md) and contact your account representative.
