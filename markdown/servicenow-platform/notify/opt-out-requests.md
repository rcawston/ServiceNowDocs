# Configure SMS opt-out preferences

Allow recipients to opt out of receiving text messages.

## Before you begin

Role required: notify\_setup\_admin, notify\_admin

## About this task

According to regulations in the CTIA Short Code Monitoring Handbook, recipients must be allowed to opt out of receiving text messages. The opt-out functionality is applicable only to Notify. When the user sends an SMS message with an opt-out keyword to any Notify number, the user is opted out of receiving messages from only the Notify number to which the message has been sent, not from all Notify numbers on that instance.

**Important:** The Advanced opt-out feature is automatically enabled for short code and long code numbers associated with a Messaging Service. For more information, refer [Getting Started with Advanced Opt-Out for Messaging Services](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034798533-Getting-Started-with-Advanced-Opt-Out-for-Messaging-Services). As this feature is a duplicate of the Twilio's new Advanced Opt-out feature, you should not activate the feature for numbers that are part of Messaging Service. For long code numbers that are not part of a Messaging service, Twilio handles the opt-out for default stop keywords listed at [Twilio support for opt-out keywords](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/223134027-Twilio-support-for-opt-out-keywords-SMS-STOP-filtering-).

This feature is disabled by default and holds significance for short-code and long codes that are not part of Messaging Service. To enable this feature, the Notify admin.
