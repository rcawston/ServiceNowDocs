# Controlling the on-call communication channel with Notify

Configure On-Call Scheduling with Notify to always use a user's preferred communication channel.

If **Force communication channel** is specified in the **Escalation settings** for rosters, the preferred user device is used: SMS, voice, or email.

For example, if the preferred device is SMS and the on-call member does not have an SMS device defined, the user is not contacted even if the user has an email address. When forcing a communication channel on an escalation level does not succeed, no further communication attempts are made. The fact that the user could not be reached is logged.
