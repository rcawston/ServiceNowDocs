# Say workflow activity

The **say** workflow activity allows you to play a message, using text to speech, on a Notify call.

|Variable|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|Text to say|Specify the text to read.|
|Language|Select the language and locale to use when reading text.|
|Advanced|Select this check box to use a script to define the language and message, instead of using the **Text to say** and **Language** values.|
