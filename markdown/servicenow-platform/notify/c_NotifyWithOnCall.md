# Using Notify with On-Call Scheduling

When using both Notify and On-Call Scheduling, you can send On-call escalation notifications as SMS messages, in addition to emails.

Configure the following items to use Notify with On-Call Scheduling:

-   You must add at least one Notify phone number to the On-Call Group number group. This group is configured by default to handle inbound SMS responses \(via On-Call: Check Assignment Response\) that accepts or rejects an on-call assignment and to handle outbound voice calls \(via On-Call: Assign by Acknowledgement Voice\) to accept or reject assignments.
-   You must configure workflows, such as the On-Call: Assign by Acknowledgement to drive escalations via SMS and Voice.
