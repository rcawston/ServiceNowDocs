# Notify activity event handlers

Notify workflow activities provide JavaScript functions that are invoked automatically when your telephony provider broadcasts certain events.

When the telephony provider broadcasts an event related to a Notify call, such as the caller hanging up, the event is processed by the workflow associated with that Notify call. All currently-executing Notify activities in that workflow invoke a JavaScript function associated with that event.

Not all activities that support an event provide a default event handler implementation. You can provide an implementation for those event handlers when creating custom Notify activities.
