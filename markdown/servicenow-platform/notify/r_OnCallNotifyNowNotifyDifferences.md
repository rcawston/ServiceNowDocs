# Key differences between on-call scheduling with NotifyNow and with Notify

There are key differences between on-call scheduling with NotifyNow and on-call scheduling with Notify.

## Tracking responses to questions

The On call:Assign by Acknowledgement workflow no longer uses the Notify Question tables to track assignment responses. When you install On-Call Scheduling with Notify, the message\_number column is added to the Notify Messages \[notify\_messages\] table to track responses to on-call assignment requests. This column indicates if the contacted user accepted or rejected the assignment.
