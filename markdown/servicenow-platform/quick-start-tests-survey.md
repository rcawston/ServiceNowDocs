# Quick start tests for Assessments and Surveys

Validate that Assessments and Surveys still works after you make any configuration change such as apply an upgrade or develop an application. Copy and customize these quick start tests to pass when using your instance-specific data.

Assessments and Surveys quick start tests require activating the Automated Test Framework for Survey plugin \(com.glide.automated\_testing\_impl. Survey\).

**Note:** In the Australia release, all the buttons on the assessments or surveys cards have been removed. To run the Automated Test Framework tests successfully, the **Click the Take Survey button** step must be replaced with **Click the Survey card** for all tests that have this step.
