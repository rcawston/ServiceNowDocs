# Configure a Virtual Desktop Infrastructure \(VDI\) for voice calls with Amazon Connect

Contact centers commonly use Virtual Desktop Infrastructure \(VDI\) to optimize agent usage of browser applications. This feature enables agents to use ServiceNow and the Amazon Connect Contact Control Panel \(CCP\) within a VDI environment, taking both inbound and outbound calls without disruption. Administrators can configure groups of agents to use either VDI or non-VDI browsers based on OpenFrame configuration values.

## VDI support for voice calls overview

VDI support for Contact Control Panel \(CCP\) enables agents working in virtual desktop environments can access all Amazon Connect call controls within their Workspace.

## Agent Use Case

Agents working in a VDI environment can do the following:

-   Use Amazon Connect CCP within the VDI environment.
-   Receive and handle inbound calls in Amazon CCP.
-   Initiate outbound calls in Amazon CCP.

## Admin Use Case

-   **Dependencies:**

    Role required: Admin

    -   Complete the VDI setup.

        **Note:**

        Refer to the following Amazon Workspace documents for reference:
