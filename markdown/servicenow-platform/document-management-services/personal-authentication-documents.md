# Personal authentication

Personal authentication enables individual users to authenticate with their personal accounts within ServiceNow using a secure connection between the user's identity and their corresponding Microsoft OneDrive or Google Drive account, allowing users to access, view, and manage their personal files directly from ServiceNow.

## Personal authentication for Microsoft OneDrive

Personal authentication allows users to securely connect their individual Microsoft OneDrive accounts to Document Management. This enables user-specific access to files stored in Microsoft OneDrive, supporting personalized document handling such as attaching, viewing, or managing files directly within ServiceNow records.

This authentication method uses OAuth 2.0 to authorize each user, ensuring that file access and operations are performed under their unique identity. Each user connects to their own Microsoft OneDrive account, ensuring privacy and personalized access.

## Personal authentication for Google Drive

Personal authentication for Google Drive enables users to securely link their individual Google accounts with Document Management. This integration allows users to access, upload, and manage files from their personal Google Drive within ServiceNow, ensuring that all document interactions are authenticated under the user’s unique identity.
