# Link documents to Knowledge articles

Manage a document and access the latest version of the document from an article by linking the document to a Knowledge article.

## Before you begin

Your administrator must have activated the following plugins:

-   Knowledge Document plugin \(com.snc.knowledge\_document\)
-   Knowledge Management Advanced plugin \(com.snc.knowledge\_advanced\)

The document is already uploaded and published. For more information, see [Upload a document](t_UploadADocument.md) and [Publish an approved revision](t_PublishAnApprovedRevision.md).

You must have contribute access to the Knowledge Base within which the article linked to the document is stored.

If a Knowledge article is already linked to the document, you must have contribute access to the article.

Role required: document\_management\_user and knowledge

## About this task

You can link the initial or revised version of a document to a Knowledge article. The document appears as an attachment to the linked article. Revising a document doesn't automatically update the document attached to the linked Knowledge article. Therefore, every time you revise a document, you must again link the revised document to the Knowledge article.

**Note:**

As the owner of a document or an administrator, you can link the document to a published article. If the article is checked out by another user, you can't link the document to the associated article, unless the article is published.

A managed document can only be linked to one article.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Managed Documents** &gt; **Documents** &gt; **All**.

2.  Click the document.

3.  In the Knowledge Settings related list, fill in the fields.
