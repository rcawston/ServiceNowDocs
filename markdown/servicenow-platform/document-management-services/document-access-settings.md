# Document security and access

Document access permissions for users and groups provide you with security for your documents.

## Owner access to documents

By default, the document owner has all privileges to the document and can do the following:

-   Update the document parameters
-   Upload document versions
-   Create document references
-   Share a document with other users
-   Delete a document

**Note:**

If the document owner changes, the new owner obtains all rights to the document and the previous owner loses access. If the previous owner wants to keep access to the document, the document should be shared instead of transferring owner access.

## Document access settings

You can access documents through three different settings.

<table id="table_ls2_rfm_hsb"><thead><tr><th>

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>## Sharing permissions and roles

Users can give permissions to other users based on their own access to the document. The permission levels are:

-   Owner
-   Writer
-   Reader

To share documents with other users and groups you must have write access to the document record and roles to share at different levels.
