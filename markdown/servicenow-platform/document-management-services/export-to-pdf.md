Export an individual record or list of records into a PDF format that supports accessibility. When this feature is enabled, accessibility tags are available in the PDF tag tree to help users who rely on-screen readers to navigate, understand, and interact with the generated PDF documents.

-   Detailed Portrait \(exports the list and the associated form for each record\).
-   Detailed Landscape \(exports the list and the associated form for each record\).
