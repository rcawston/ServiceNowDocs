# Document Viewer

Document Viewer enables you to view documents directly in the ServiceNow AI Platform rather than having to download them.

Document Viewer supports viewing various file types in the platform including a UTF-8 character encoded PDF file. The maximum document file size is 50 MB. To use Document Viewer, enable it at instance level and for the tables for which you want to use it.

**Note:** Document Viewer also supports FedRAMP instances.

You can view the following file types:

-   MS Word \(.doc\) and \(.docx\)
-   MS PowerPoint \(.ppt\) and \(pptx\)
-   MS Excel \(.xls\) and \(.xlsx\)
-   PDF
-   PNG
-   JPEG

**Note:** The rotate option doesn’t work for images.

Other document types, for example, .zip or .exe files, are automatically downloaded without requiring Document Viewer. Document viewer converts word documents and spreadsheets to pdf first in order to view them. This might take some time to render the file the first time.
