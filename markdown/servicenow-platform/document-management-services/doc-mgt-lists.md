# Document Management lists

Lists are a collection of template documents you can use to create documents that are linked to other target records. Only users with the admin role can access lists.

## Document lists

A user with the admin role can create document lists and add multiple documents to a single list. Only users with the admin role can access lists.

## New hire onboarding

During new hire onboarding, employees must upload multiple documents such as ID, training certificates, and so on. Your organization can create documents as templates and group them under a list. Then when you reference this list to a target record, all the template documents under the list are created and linked to the target record.

## List entries

Lists entries are a mapping of a template document with a document list. Only template documents can be linked to a list, such as when documents have the **Template** option selected in the document record. The Document List Entries related list displays the list entries.

**Note:** Users can link only documents that they have access to.
