# Enable electronic signature for approval

Enabling electronic signatures for approval. Electronic signatures are helpful if you must obtain a digital signature for compliance or auditing purposes.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

You can activate the [Approval with e-signature plugin](../approvals/r_InstalledWApprWithEsignature.md) to require that users type in a user name and password when reviewing and approving documents.

The digital signature is not tracked or stored in the document record. Users must simply type in a user name and password after clicking the **Approve** or **Reject** button.
