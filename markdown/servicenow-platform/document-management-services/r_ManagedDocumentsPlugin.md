# Managed Documents plugin

This page describes the applications and modules, database table structure, scripts, and roles.

## Database table structure

The following tables are added:

|Display Name \(Table Name\)|Description|
|---------------------------|-----------|
|Document \[dms\_document\]|The document details.|
|Revision \[dms\_revision\]|The document revisions.|
|Audience \[dms\_audience\]|The intended document readers.|
|Classifications \[classification\]|The document restriction level, such as public or confidential. \(Does not define access to the document. Document security is set in user and group permissions.\)|
|Type \[dms\_type\]|The document purpose.|
|Component \[dms\_component\]|The components of name formats. The value field is a dot-walking expression that is evaluated. An exception is made for the revision because it does not exist when the revision name is generated.|
|Name format \[dms\_name\_format\]|The composition of components to generate revision names.|
|Approval sequence \[approval\_sequence\]|The approval sequences that users must follow.|
|Approval Rule \[dms\_approval\_rule\]|The criteria that records of the dms\_document table must match. Used to automatically add approvers to a document.|
|Collection \[dms\_collection\]|The document groups created by the user.|

## Roles

This plugin introduces two new roles:

|Role|Description|
|----|-----------|
|document\_management\_user|This role enables a user to access the Managed Documents plugin, create documents, and search for documents. Document reviewers and approvers need the document\_management\_user role to access the Managed Document plugin. \(Please note that reviewers and approvers can also access a document revision from an approval record.\)|
|document\_management\_admin|This role enables a user to change administrative settings for the Managed Documents plugin.|

**Note:** Each document has individual permissions, so even if a user is given the document\_management\_user role and has permissions to the application, the user can only view documents to which they have been given access.

-   **[Install the Managed Documents plugin](t_InstallTheManagedDocumentsPlugin.md)**  
The Managed Documents plugin is available for activation by users with the admin role.
