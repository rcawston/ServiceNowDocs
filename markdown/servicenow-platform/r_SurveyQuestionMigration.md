# Survey question migration

Before you migrate a legacy survey, understand that some legacy survey questions cannot be migrated due to incompatible question types.

Legacy survey questions are migrated from the Survey Question \[survey\_question\_new\] table to the Assessment Metric \[asmt\_metric\] table. In legacy surveys, the **Type** field on the Survey Question table determines how the question renders on the survey questionnaire. In assessment surveys, the **Data type** field on the Assessment Metric table serves a similar purpose. Certain legacy survey types are not supported in assessment surveys.

The following table shows the conversion path for each legacy survey question type to an assessment data type, if there is one.
