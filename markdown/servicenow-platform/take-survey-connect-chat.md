## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Connect Support** &gt; **Support Administration** &gt; **Chat Survey**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  In the Chat Survey form, fill the fields.

    |Field|Description|

    |Survey|Survey whose instance should be available in Connect Support.|
    |Type|Type of chat where the survey is available. Connect: Survey is available in Connect Support.|
