# Client software distribution extension keys

Client software distribution \(CSD\) extension keys allow you to customize the deployment and revocation of software from distribution providers.

These pre-defined keys allow you to generate input variables for workflows that deploy and revoke software from external distribution providers:

-   **SetDeploymentData**: Sets the software order information and generates the input variables for the deployment workflow.
-   **SetRevocationData**: Generates the input variables for the revocation workflow.
-   **CheckRevocable**: Specifies the conditions that determine if an installation can be revoked. If the software configuration associated with the installed software allows uninstallation, the installed software can be revoked.
