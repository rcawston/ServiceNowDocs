# List of Orchestration activities

Use Orchestration activities in a Workflow to integrate with third-party systems.

Several Orchestration activities have been rewritten as [Application scope](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/c_ApplicationScope.md) activities using the [activity designer](c_WorkflowActivityDesigner.md) and grouped into [activity packs](c_OrchestrationActivityPacks.md).
