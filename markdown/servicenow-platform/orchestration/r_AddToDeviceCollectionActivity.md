# Add to Device Collection activity

The Add to Device Collection activity adds the specified device into a Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager \(SCCM\) device collection.

The Add to Device Collection activity uses the [Powershell activity template](t_CreateAPowershellActivity.md#) to add a specified device to an SCCM device collection. The activity is configured to use a MID Server with Powershell capabilities and to run a MID Server script called AddToDeviceCollection.ps1 to edit the collection.

To access this activity in the Workflow Editor, select the **Custom** tab, and then navigate to **Custom Activities** &gt; **System Center Configuration Manager \(SCCM\)**.

**Note:** The Add to Device Collection activity does not use pre-processing or post-processing scripts.
