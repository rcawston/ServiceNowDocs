# Kubernetes extension classes

The Discovery and Service Mapping app adds or updates classes for the Kubernetes pattern.

CMDB CI Class Models is a ServiceNow Store app that adds class models that extend the CMDB class hierarchy. The new or updated classes include class descriptions, identification rules, identifier entries, and, if applicable, dependent relationships. You can use the added classes just like any other CMDB class. Applications such as Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns can use the class extensions to populate CIs and discover technologies and software.

See the [full release notes for all CMDB CI Class Models](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/store-release-notes/page/release-notes/store/it-operations-management/store-rn-itom-cmdb-class-models.html?emcs_t=S2h8ZW1haWx8Ym9hcmRfc3Vic2NyaXB0aW9ufE1FMlVTSFREVDc3S0hTfDMzNDcxMjV8U1VCU0NSSVBUSU9OU3xoSw).

## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/store-release-notes/page/release-notes/store/sn-store-release-notes.html).

## Kubernetes pattern

The Kubernetes pattern main flow helps with discovering Kubernetes core elements. The classes in this release, extend the support to discover Kubernetes workload controller components like deployments, daemonsets, and statefulsets. The Workload Share library captures information about deployments, daemonsets, and statefulsets and stores them in the respective tables. Other extensions include a YAML and service mesh extension that generates a YAML file to track configuration files and creating service to service relations by discovering service mesh information.
