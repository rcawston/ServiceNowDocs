# DNS resource record classes

The CMDB CI Class Models ServiceNow Store app adds or updates classes for DNS records, also known as a DNS resource records \(RR\).

## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/store-release-notes/page/release-notes/store/sn-store-release-notes.html).

## DNS zone resource records

A DNS record is an entry in the domain name system \(DNS\) database that provides information about a specific aspect of a domain name to enable you to trace the ownership and tenure of a domain details from tools like who is and DNS lookup tools. Each DNS record contains data associated with a domain name, such as IP addresses, mail server addresses, or other resources. Each type of record serves a specific purpose, such as mapping domain names to IP addresses \(A records\), AAAA records, identifying mail servers for a domain \(MX records\), and providing aliases for domain names \(CNAME records\), among others. DNS resource records are essential for the proper functioning of the DNS infrastructure on the internet.

See the [full release notes for all CMDB CI Class Models](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/store-release-notes/page/release-notes/store/it-operations-management/store-rn-itom-cmdb-class-models.html?emcs_t=S2h8ZW1haWx8Ym9hcmRfc3Vic2NyaXB0aW9ufE1FMlVTSFREVDc3S0hTfDMzNDcxMjV8U1VCU0NSSVBUSU9OU3xoSw).

**Note:** In CMDB CI Class Models release 1.57, existing classes in the CMDB schema that represent DNS resource records like A, AAAA, CName, and so on are deprecated. The following classes are defined with an ideal base, child class, and identification rule.

## Supported DNS resource record types

-   A Record: Holds the IP address of a domain.
-   AAAA Record: Contains the IPv6 address of a domain.
-   CNAME Record: Forwards one domain or subdomain to another domain. Does not provide an IP address.
-   MX Record: Directs mail to an email server.

The supported record types enable actions like the following:

-   Capture domain name registration in the CMDB and create workflow to request, approve, and track life cycle.
-   Auto-populate the data from integration to the registrar.
-   Connect the data to an IPAM record.
-   Connect the data to the certificate on the DNS.
-   Connect the data to the CDN provider.
