# OpenStack extension classes

The CMDB CI Class Models app adds or updates classes for OpenStack.

CMDB CI Class Models is a ServiceNow Store app that adds class models that extend the CMDB class hierarchy. The new or updated classes include class descriptions, identification rules, identifier entries, and, if applicable, dependent relationships. You can use the added classes just like any other CMDB class. Applications such as Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns can use the class extensions to populate CIs and discover technologies and software.

See the [full release notes for all CMDB CI Class Models](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/store-release-notes/page/release-notes/store/it-operations-management/store-rn-itom-cmdb-class-models.html?emcs_t=S2h8ZW1haWx8Ym9hcmRfc3Vic2NyaXB0aW9ufE1FMlVTSFREVDc3S0hTfDMzNDcxMjV8U1VCU0NSSVBUSU9OU3xoSw).

## OpenStack

OpenStack is a cloud operating system that controls large pools of compute, storage, and networking resources throughout a datacenter. All of these resources are managed and provisioned through APIs with common authentication mechanisms. Other components provide services such as orchestration, fault management, and service management to promote high availability of user applications. OpenStack is broken up into services to enable you to plug and play components depending on your needs. These components are designed for horizontal scalability, so you can easily add new resources to grow your cloud over time.
