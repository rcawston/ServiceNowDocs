# CMDB CI Class Models app

The CMDB contains base-system classes that store data about configuration items \(CIs\). The CMDB CI Class Models ServiceNow® Store app adds class models that extend the CMDB class hierarchy, including class descriptions, identification rules, identifier entries, and dependent relationships if applicable.

You can use the added classes like any other class. Applications such as Discovery and Service Mapping can use class extensions to populate CIs and to discover technologies and software.

See the [full release notes for all CMDB CI Class Models](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/store-release-notes/page/release-notes/store/it-operations-management/store-rn-itom-cmdb-class-models.html?emcs_t=S2h8ZW1haWx8Ym9hcmRfc3Vic2NyaXB0aW9ufE1FMlVTSFREVDc3S0hTfDMzNDcxMjV8U1VCU0NSSVBUSU9OU3xoSw).

## Add class models

The CMDB CI Class Models app adds classes, columns, and associated metadata as related records in the following tables:

-   CMDB Class Information \[cmdb\_class\_info\]: Class descriptions
-   Identifier \[cmdb\_identifier\]: Identification rules
-   Identifier Entry \[cmdb\_identifier\_entry\]: Identification entries
-   CMDB Metadata Hosting Rules \[cmdb\_metadata\_hosting\]: Dependent relationships
-   CMDB Deduplication Task Lookup or Related item allowed classes \[cmdb\_duplicate\_lookup\_related\_allowed\_class\]. For more information, see [Detecting duplicate referenced CIs during lookup-based identification](../configuration-management-database-cmdb/id-detect-dup-ci.md#section_unn_yjr_xgc).

## Discover using extension classes

The following table lists the software and technologies that applications can discover using the extension classes. It provides links to documentation for CMDB CI Class Models and the corresponding discovery patterns.

## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/store-release-notes/page/release-notes/store/sn-store-release-notes.html).

## Verify successful installation

After installing the CMDB CI Class Models app, make sure the classes were added successfully:

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Configuration** &gt; **CI Class Manager**.
2.  Select **Hierarchy** to display the CI Classes list.

    This list contains the added classes, such as the Nutanix classes.

3.  Select a class to see the corresponding class details, identification rules, identifier entries, and dependent relationships, if applicable.

**Warning:** Uninstalling the CMDB CI Class Models app might compromise the integrity of the CMDB and result in unexpected behavior.
