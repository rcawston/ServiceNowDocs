# IBM Hardware Management Console \(HMC\) extension classes

The CMDB CI Class Models app adds or updates classes for the IBM Hardware Management Console \(HMC\).

CMDB CI Class Models is a ServiceNow Store app that adds class models that extend the CMDB class hierarchy. The new or updated classes include class descriptions, identification rules, identifier entries, and, if applicable, dependent relationships. You can use the added classes just like any other CMDB class. Applications such as Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns can use the class extensions to populate CIs and discover technologies and software.

See the [full release notes for all CMDB CI Class Models](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/store-release-notes/page/release-notes/store/it-operations-management/store-rn-itom-cmdb-class-models.html?emcs_t=S2h8ZW1haWx8Ym9hcmRfc3Vic2NyaXB0aW9ufE1FMlVTSFREVDc3S0hTfDMzNDcxMjV8U1VCU0NSSVBUSU9OU3xoSw).

## IBM Hardware Management Console \(HMC\)

The IBM HMC extension classes support discovery of IBM virtualization technology by providing:

-   Discovery of LPARs/FRAMEs, which SAM use cases need
-   Topology data of IBM HMC, which event correlation requires
-   Topology data for ITSM use cases, such as in-frame migration

## Classes

This section lists the classes that the CMDB CI Class Models app adds or updates. See the class columns table for further details about the columns added for each class. For the list of classes in the base system, including classes that this app might extend, see [CMDB tables descriptions](../configuration-management-database-cmdb/cmdb-tables-details.md).
