# Internet of Things \(IoT\) extension classes

The CMDB CI Class Models app adds or updates classes for the Internet of Things \(IoT\).

CMDB CI Class Models is a ServiceNow Store app that adds class models that extend the CMDB class hierarchy. The new or updated classes include class descriptions, identification rules, identifier entries, and, if applicable, dependent relationships. You can use the added classes just like any other CMDB class. Applications such as Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns can use the class extensions to populate CIs and discover technologies and software.

See the [full release notes for all CMDB CI Class Models](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/store-release-notes/page/release-notes/store/it-operations-management/store-rn-itom-cmdb-class-models.html?emcs_t=S2h8ZW1haWx8Ym9hcmRfc3Vic2NyaXB0aW9ufE1FMlVTSFREVDc3S0hTfDMzNDcxMjV8U1VCU0NSSVBUSU9OU3xoSw).

## Internet of Things \(IoT\)

IoT is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. The classes added in this release, extend the Data Model to provide a foundation for the representation of IoT CI classes. This foundation underpins workflows for Enterprise Asset Management \(EAM\), Governance Risk Conformance \(GRC\), Component Supply Management \(CSM\), and Field Service Management \(FSM\) surrounding the management of IoT devices and the transport vehicles that some reside in.
