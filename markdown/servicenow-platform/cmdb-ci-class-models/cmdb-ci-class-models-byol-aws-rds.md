# BYOL model of RDS for Oracle extension classes

The CMDB CI Class Models app adds or updates classes for the BYOL Model of RDS for Oracle.

CMDB CI Class Models is a ServiceNow Store app that adds class models that extend the CMDB class hierarchy. The new or updated classes include class descriptions, identification rules, identifier entries, and, if applicable, dependent relationships. You can use the added classes just like any other CMDB class. Applications such as Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns can use the class extensions to populate CIs and discover technologies and software.

See the [full release notes for all CMDB CI Class Models](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/store-release-notes/page/release-notes/store/it-operations-management/store-rn-itom-cmdb-class-models.html?emcs_t=S2h8ZW1haWx8Ym9hcmRfc3Vic2NyaXB0aW9ufE1FMlVTSFREVDc3S0hTfDMzNDcxMjV8U1VCU0NSSVBUSU9OU3xoSw).

## BYOL Model of RDS for Oracle

The Amazon RDS for Oracle is a fully managed commercial database that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale Oracle deployments in the cloud. You can run Amazon RDS for Oracle in one of two different licensing models: “License Included” and “Bring-Your-Own-License \(BYOL\)“. In the “License Included” service model, you do not need separately purchased Oracle licenses; the Oracle Database software has been licensed by AWS.

The base system supports discovery of the RDS Databases and their licenses.
