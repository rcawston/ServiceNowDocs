# Transport Layer Security \(TLS\) extension classes

The CMDB CI Class Models app adds or updates a class for TLS certificates.

CMDB CI Class Models is a ServiceNow Store app that adds class models that extend the CMDB class hierarchy. The new or updated classes include class descriptions, identification rules, identifier entries, and, if applicable, dependent relationships. You can use the added classes just like any other CMDB class. Applications such as Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns can use the class extensions to populate CIs and discover technologies and software.

See the [full release notes for all CMDB CI Class Models](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/store-release-notes/page/release-notes/store/it-operations-management/store-rn-itom-cmdb-class-models.html?emcs_t=S2h8ZW1haWx8Ym9hcmRfc3Vic2NyaXB0aW9ufE1FMlVTSFREVDc3S0hTfDMzNDcxMjV8U1VCU0NSSVBUSU9OU3xoSw).

## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store.

## Transport Layer Security \(TLS\)

TLS is a cryptographic protocol provide communications security over a computer network. The TLS protocol provides privacy and data integrity between communicating computer applications. Once the client and the server have agreed to use TLS, they negotiate a stateful connection by using a handshaking procedure. The server usually provides identification in the form of a digital certificate. The certificate contains the server name, the trusted certificate authority \(CA\) that vouches for the authenticity of the certificate, and the server's public encryption key. The client confirms the validity of the certificate before proceeding. When the handshake is completed, a secured connection is established.

## Scoped apps certification class

The scoped apps certification class supports TLS certificates. With this class you can proactively manage certificates by keeping stakeholders informed about any impending expiries. Use this extension class to promote that certificates are monitored and renewed before they expire, to help prevent severe outage of production systems.

## Classes

This section lists the classes that the CMDB CI Class Models app adds or updates. See the class columns table for further details about the columns added for each class.

The CMDB CI Class Models: Release 1.4.0 updates the following class:

|Class|Extends|Description|
|-----|-------|-----------|
|Unique Certificate \[cmdb\_ci\_certificate\]|Configuration Item \[cmdb\_ci\]|A public key certificate in X.509 standard format.|

The CMDB CI Class Models app changes the Unique Certificate \[cmdb\_ci\_certificate\] class as follows:

-   The **assigned\_to** attribute now depends on the **assignment\_group** attribute so that users in the **assigned\_to** attribute are filtered based on the specified **assignment\_group**.
-   The [Certificate Inventory and Management](../../it-operations-management/discovery/cert-inventory-mgmt.md) app populates the Unique Certificate \[cmdb\_ci\_certificate\] table. The list view for that class does not have a **New** button and you can no longer add new records to the table. This is because there are certain fields that are extracted from binary encoded parameters in the certificate which users may not be able to provide. Also, certificates have to be discovered rather uploaded.
-   You can no longer add or delete attachments in the **Certificate file** attribute.

The CMDB CI Class Models: Release 1.3.0 adds the following classes. For the list of classes in the base system, including classes that this app might extend, see [CMDB tables descriptions](../configuration-management-database-cmdb/cmdb-tables-details.md).

|Class|Extends|Description|
|-----|-------|-----------|
|Unique Certificate \[cmdb\_ci\_certificate\]|Configuration Item \[cmdb\_ci\]|N/A|
|Certificate Domain \[certificate\_domain\]|N/A|Fully qualified domain name.|
