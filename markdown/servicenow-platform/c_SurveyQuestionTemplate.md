# Survey question template

Question templates define reusable sets of answer options for survey questions.

Question templates define reusable rating scales for answering questions, where each answer option on the scale is a template definition. For example, the template named **Satisfaction** represents a satisfaction scale and contains the following template definitions: **Very Satisfied**, **Satisfied**, **Neutral**, **Dissatisfied**, and **Very Dissatisfied**.
