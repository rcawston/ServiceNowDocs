# Generate an assessment with the on-demand API

The Assign Assessment buttons call an API to generate on-demand assessments.

## Before you begin

Role required: assessment\_admin or admin

## About this task

## Procedure

1.  To generate an assessment, call the [AssessmentCreation API](../api-reference/server-api-reference/c_AssessmentCreation.md) from any script in the system, such as a business rule or client script.

2.  Use the sys\_ids of these items:

    -   An assessable record to evaluate. The assessable record must be associated with an on-demand type and at least one category that contains non-scripted metrics.
    -   One or more users who should perform the assessment. The API generates a questionnaire about the specified assessable record for each user.
