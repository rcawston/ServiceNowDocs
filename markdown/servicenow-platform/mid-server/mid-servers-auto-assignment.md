# Using MID Server IP range auto-assignment

Discovery Quick Start can automatically assign ranges of IP addresses, called subnets, to qualified MID Servers. This subnet auto-assignment requires SNMP credentials for read-only access to routers Discovery uses. The Automation Status Set form shows summary details of subnet Discoveries and the IP range assignments for associated MID Servers.

</table>To be automatically assigned to a subnet, a MID Server must be:

-   In a running **\(Up\)** state.
-   Successfully validated.
-   Able to access one or more subnets in your network.

The subnet assignments that the instance makes for your MID Servers are stored in the Automation Status Set \[automation\_status\_set\] table. For details about MID Server auto-assignment, see [Discovery Quick Start](../../it-operations-management/discovery/discovery-quick-start.md).

**Important:** You must auto-assign at least one MID Server to create a schedule automatically.

**Parent Topic:**[Configuring MID Servers](c_MIDServerConfiguration.md)

## Required SNMP OIDs for MID Server IP range auto-assignment

Customers who use network service providers must request specific SNMP access to use MID Server IP range auto-assignment.

IP range auto-assignment requires SNMP credentials for read-only access to all routers that Discovery uses to identify subnets. In addition, your service provider must grant the following SNMPWALK access:

-   iso.org.dod.internet.mgmt.mib-2.ip.ipRouteTable \(1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21\)
    -   ipRouteDest \(1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.1\)
    -   ipRouteNextHop \(1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.7\)
    -   ipRouteType \(1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.8\)
    -   ipRouteMask \(1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.11\)
-   iso.org.dod.internet.mgmt.mib-2.ip.ipForward.ipCidrRouteTable \(1.3.6.1.2.1.4.24.4\)
    -   ipCidrRouteDest \(1.3.6.1.2.1.4.24.4.1.1\)
    -   ipCidrRouteMask \(1.3.6.1.2.1.4.24.4.1.2\)
    -   ipCidrRouteNextHop \(1.3.6.1.2.1.4.24.4.1.4\)
    -   ipCidrRouteType \(1.3.6.1.2.1.4.24.4.1.6\)

## View automation status sets and IP range assignments

The Automation Status Set form shows summary details of a subnet Discovery and the subsequent IP range assignments for MID Servers selected for automatic subnet assignment.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **MID Server** &gt; **Automation Status Sets**.

2.  Select a status record for a subnet Discovery you want to view.

    The form contains read-only status information about the selected Discovery, the subnets found, and the range assignment process for the MID Servers you selected for auto assignment.

    **Important:** IP ranges assigned manually prior to using auto-assignment in the [Discovery Quick Start](../../it-operations-management/discovery/discovery-quick-start.md) are affected as follows:

    -   Individual IP ranges are retained and appended to the ranges assigned automatically by the system for the designated MID Server.
    -   If the MID Server was configured with the **ALL** ranges selection, the auto-assignment feature overwrites that designation with the ranges it finds.

3.  Select the **Subnets Discovered** related list to view the list of subnets available for assignment.

    ![Subnets Discovered](../image/SubnetsDiscovered.png)

4.  Select the **IP Range Assignments** related list to view the IP ranges that were assigned to a MID Server.

    **Warning:** IP ranges identified by Discovery are stored in the IP collection \[ip\_address\_collection\] table, which is only used for MID Server IP range auto-assignment in the Jakarta release. This table is intended for future development and **should not** be used in any customizations, including column additions, business rules, or scripting actions.
