# Rekey a MID Server

Rekey a MID Server to generate a new private key. Private keys are used to decrypt automation credentials, so that MID Servers can transmit information securely. Key pairs are initially generated when a MID Server is validated, and MID Servers should be rekeyed periodically to meet security requirements.

</table>## About this task

When the MID Server comes back online, the system automatically validates the new key, and the MID Server resumes processing automation tasks.

Automation credentials are secured by encrypting them in the instance with the MID Server’s trusted public key prior to transmission. When the MID Server is created, it generates a keypair, consisting of a public and private key. After the MID Server is validated, it can use the private key to decrypt automation credentials. You should occasionally rekey the MID Server to meet your organizations security requirements.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **MID Server** &gt; **Servers**.

2.  Open the MID Server whose keypairs you want to rotate.

3.  Under **Related Links**, click **Rekey**.
