# MID Server dashboard

The MID Server dashboard is a central place for MID Server users to monitor ongoing operations. The dashboard consists of reports and gauges that display information from the MID Server Status table.

<table id="table_jmp_fsf_khb"><tbody><tr><td>

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>The MID Server Dashboard is available from the **MID Server** &gt; **Dashboard** module.

After upgrading to Discovery Admin Workspace version 1.3.1 \(August 2024 Store\), you can navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Discovery Admin Workspace** &gt; **Insights** and use the enhanced dashboard.

## MID Server Overview tab

The Overview tab provides graphs showing the status of MID Servers, including any validation issues or pending upgrades and jobs. The tab also displays which MID Servers by capability.

## MID Server Performance tab

The Performance tab displays information relating to the MID Server CPU and memory usage, including the life-cycle event history.

## MID Server Custom performance tab

The Custom performance tab enables users to set custom MID Server selection criteria to show particular MID Servers in a select time frame.

## MID Server status gauge

The MID Server Status gauge on the dashboard displays basic information about each MID Server. This information comes from the MID Server Status \[ecc\_agent\_status\] table.

If the version is not compatible, the MID Server status is not changed to **Down** in the MID Server dashboard. So it might still appear to be processing commands when it actually is not doing so. You must check the MID Server **Version** on the dashboard.

See [KB0535181](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0535181) for additional MID Server troubleshooting information.

The icons in the **Version** column indicates the following:

-   **Red**: Incompatible. The MID Server and instance do not belong to the same release. You must [upgrade the MID Server](t_UpgradeTheMIDServerManually.md) and verify that it is not pinned to an older version with the [mid.version.override](mid-server-version-selection.md) property. The MID Server will not be upgraded until the parameter is cleared.
-   **Yellow**: Compatible, but an upgrade is recommended. This indicates that the MID Server version belongs to the same family as the instance, but not the same version.
-   **Green**: Compatible. No upgrade necessary.
-   **Gray**: Incompatible. The instance cannot detect the version.

</td><td>

The status of the MID Server.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Validated

</td><td>

Whether or not the MID Server was [validated](t_ValidateAMIDServer.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Max memory used %

</td><td>

The highest percent usage of memory on the system that hosts the MID Server, in the configured sampling interval. The default interval is 30 minutes, but this value is user configurable. See [MID Server resource threshold alerts](mid-resource-threshold-alerts.md) for details.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Mean CPU used %

</td><td>

The average percent usage of CPU on the system that hosts the MID Server, in the configured sampling interval. The default interval is 30 minutes, but this value is user configurable. See [MID Server resource threshold alerts](mid-resource-threshold-alerts.md) for details.

Pending jobs

</td><td>

Number of pending ECC queue jobs for that MID Server.

Number of processing ECC queue jobs for that MID Server.

Version

</td><td>

The version of the MID Server. An icon indicates the validity of the MID Server:-   **Red**: Incompatible. The MID Server and instance do not belong to the same release. You must [upgrade the MID Server](t_UpgradeTheMIDServerManually.md) and verify that it is not pinned to an older version with the [mid.version.override](mid-server-version-selection.md) property. The MID Server will not be upgraded until the parameter is cleared.
-   **Yellow**: Compatible, but an upgrade is recommended. This indicates that the MID Server version belongs to the same family as the instance, but not the same version.
-   **Green**: Compatible. No upgrade necessary.
-   **Gray**: Incompatible. The instance cannot detect the version.

</td></tr><tr><td>

User

</td><td>

The login name of the user. An icon indicates the validity of the user:-   **Red**: Incompatible. The user does not have the[mid\_server role](t_SetupMIDServerRole.md#) or the user does not match the value in the [mid.instance.username parameter](t_SetupMIDServerRole.md#) \(in the `config.xml` configuration file\). Reconfigure the MID Server user and [verify that it works](t_SetupMIDServerRole.md#).
-   **Green**: Compatible. The user has the mid\_server role and matches the user in the configuration file.

 **Note:** The user can also have any of the SOAP roles that the [mid\_server role](t_SetupMIDServerRole.md#) inherits.
