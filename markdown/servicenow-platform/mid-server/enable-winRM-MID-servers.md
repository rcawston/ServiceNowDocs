# Configure MID Server as WinRM trusted host

In environments using Windows Remote Management \(WinRM\), Discovery or Service Mapping can discover servers using the WinRM protocol. Add servers, which are part of WinRM, as trusted hosts on all MID Servers that Discovery or Service Mapping use for discovery.

</table>## About this task

MID Server cannot access servers using the WinRM protocol unless these servers are configured as trusted hosts for this MID Server.

Perform this procedure on each MID Server used by Service Mapping or Discovery.

## Procedure

1.  On the MID Server, open the command-line shell.

2.  To add all servers to the TrustedHosts lists, run the following command:

    `winrm s winrm/config/client '@{TrustedHosts="*"}'`

    The command requires different syntax depending on the shell: use single quotation marks around `@{TrustedHosts="*"}` in Windows PowerShell, and do not use quotation marks in Command Prompt.

3.  To add specific servers to the TrustedHosts list, run the command with the comma-separated hosts instead of the asterisk \(\*\), for example:

    `winrm s winrm/config/client '@{TrustedHosts="serverA,serverB,serverC"}'`
