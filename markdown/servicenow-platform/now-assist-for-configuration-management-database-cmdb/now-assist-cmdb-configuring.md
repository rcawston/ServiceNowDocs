# Configuring Now Assist for CMDB

Configure Now Assist for CMDB.

## Roles

Agentic workflows and their AI agents use [role masking](../../intelligent-experiences/aia-role-masking.md) to determine which users can access them. Ones installed with Now Assist applications have specific roles that come included with the application. If you select **Users with specific roles** for user access, you must configure the security controls to include these roles. For the instructions to change the security controls, see [Define security controls for an agentic workflow](../../intelligent-experiences/define-sec-controls-aw.md).

## Skill reuse in a domain-separated environment

By default, all skills exist in the global domain. When you use Now Assist in a domain-separated environment, users are only able to access data in their domain. For example, if a user uses the summarization skill, Now Assist only uses material that exists in the user's domain when generating that summary. Additionally, there is no co-mingling of data for domain-separated instances when using generative AI skills. The data resides only on the instance, and the shared services used for generative AI do not persist any requests \(prompts\) and responses. For more information, see [Domain separation in the Now Assist Admin console](../../intelligent-experiences/domain-separation-in-the-now-assist-admin-console.md). \(Note that global domain is not the same as global scope. For more information, see [Exploring Next Experience pickers](../../platform-user-interface/next-experience-pickers.md).\)
