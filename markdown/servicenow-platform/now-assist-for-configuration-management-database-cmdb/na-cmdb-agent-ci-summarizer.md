# View CI information with the Now Assist CI summarization skill

View a concise summary of key CI data. You can select the CI on a CI form, in a workspace page, or on any list view. The summary can include discovery data, ownership, and key related items such as open incidents, alerts, problems, upcoming change requests, and security vulnerabilities. Additionally, the summary lists the service instances that the CI is part of.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cmdb\_user

## About this task

This procedure describes how you can manually access the skill. In addition, any agentic workflow can use the skill.

When a Now Assist skill is enabled, the Now Assist icon ![](../../../administer/virtual-agent/images/icon-now-assist-sparkle.png) appears in the toolbar of the workspace. For more information, see [Working in the Now Assist panel](../../intelligent-experiences/now-assist-panel-overview.md).

## Procedure

1.  Select a CI from the workspace or from any list view.

    For example, select **All** and enter `cmdb_ci.list` in the search filter. Select a CI to open its CI form.

2.  Select **Summarize** in the Now Assist box.

    ![Summarize button on the CI form.](../image/na-cmdb-summarize-button.png)

    Now Assist generates and displays summary information for the CI, as in this example.

3.  Provide feedback, copy the response text to the clipboard, or refresh the response.

Procedure

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td id="d381553e172">

**Provide feedback for the summary**

</td><td>

If you think that the response was helpful, select thumbs-up ![](../../configuration-management/image/icon-thumbs-up.png). If you think that it wasn’t helpful, select thumbs-down ![](../../configuration-management/image/icon-thumbs-down.png).This feedback improves the Agentic AI model and can help to improve the future versions of this skill. The system gathers the feedback on each generated response and stores it in the Agentic AI logs \(sys\_generative\_ai\_log\_list.do\).

</td></tr><tr><td id="d381553e187">

**Copy the summary**

</td><td>

Select the copy to clipboard icon ![](../../configuration-management/image/icon-clipboard.png) to use the response information for another purpose, such as pasting into an email.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d381553e198">

**Refresh the summary**

</td><td>

If you think that data might have changed after you viewed the response, select the redo icon ![](../../configuration-management/image/icon-redo.png) to refresh the response information.
