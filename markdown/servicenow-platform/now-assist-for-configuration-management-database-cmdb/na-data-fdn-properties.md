If the workflow collects too much data, the process might fail. This property limits the duration in days \(integer starting at zero\) for the query.

 Default 90 \(query all tasks that were updated in the last 90 days\).

 For instances with little data, set the property to a high value like 36000 \(10 years\). For instances with a large store of data, experiment to determine a practical value.
