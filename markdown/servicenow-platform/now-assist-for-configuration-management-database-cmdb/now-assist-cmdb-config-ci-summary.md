# Configure the CI summarization skill

Review and configure the settings of the Now Assist for Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\) CI summarization skill to restrict the availability of the skill to certain users or conditions.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

The CI summarization skill might scan activated plugins, activated applications, and CMDB tables. The skill uses the Now LLM Service to generate summaries.

Detail type

Requirements and dependencies

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Discovery

</td><td>

The CI summarization skill extracts details from the **Discovery source** and **Most recent discovery** CI attributes.

 If CMDB 360 is enabled, the summary can show additional discovery sources for the CI. For more information, see [CMDB 360](../configuration-management-database-cmdb/multisource-cmdb.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Alerts

</td><td>

Event Management must be activated for the CI summarization skill. For more information, see [Event Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/event-management/c_EM.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Security vulnerabilities

</td><td>

Security Operations must be activated for the CI summarization skill. For more information, see [Security Operations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/security-operations-landing-page.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

CI ownership

</td><td>

The CI summarization skill determines the CI ownership based on the attribute that is specified in the **glide.cmdb.health.ci\_ownership\_field** system property.

 For more information, see [CMDB Health system properties](../configuration-management-database-cmdb/r_CMDBHealthProperties.md) and [CMDB Health](../configuration-management-database-cmdb/c_CMDBHealth.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Data on the CMDB Health Dashboard

</td><td>

The Correctness Score Calculation scheduled job improves the accuracy of the summary details on the CMDB Health Dashboard. For more information, see [Enable and configure a CMDB Health Dashboard job](../configuration-management-database-cmdb/t_EnableCMDBHealthDashboardJob.md).

</table>By default, all skills exist in the global domain. When you use Now Assist in a domain-separated environment, users are only able to access data in their domain. For example, if a user uses the summarization skill, Now Assist only uses material that exists in the user's domain when generating that summary. Additionally, there is no co-mingling of data for domain-separated instances when using generative AI skills. The data resides only on the instance, and the shared services used for generative AI do not persist any requests \(prompts\) and responses. For more information, see [Domain separation in the Now Assist Admin console](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/domain-separation-in-the-now-assist-admin-console.md). \(Note that global domain is not the same as global scope. For more information, see [Exploring Next Experience pickers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/next-experience-pickers.md).\)
