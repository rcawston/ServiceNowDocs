# Configure Service Graph Connector for Observability - Datadog

Pull in data from Datadog into your Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\).

## Before you begin

To use this Service Graph Connector, you need a subscription to a Subscription Unit that is based in the IT Operations Management \(ITOM\) Visibility application or in the ITOM Discovery application. As defined in the section titled "Managed IT Resource Types" in [ServiceNow Subscription Unit Overview](https://www.servicenow.com/products/entitlements-packages.html) for your subscription, for managed IT resources that are created or modified in the CMDB by this Service Graph Connector, but that aren’t yet managed by [ITOM Visibility or ITOM Discovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/itom-license-module.md), these resources will increase Subscription Unit consumption from that application. Review your current Subscription Unit consumption within ITOM Visibility or ITOM Discovery to ensure available capacity.

Dependencies and requirements:

-   The [Integration Commons for CMDB](../cmdb-integration-commons/integration-commons-for-cmdb.md) store app, which is automatically installed.
-   The CMDB CI class models store app, which is automatically installed. See [CMDB CI Class Models app](../cmdb-ci-class-models/cmdb-ci-class-models.md).
-   The ITOM Discovery License plugin \(com.snc.itom.discovery.license\). You must activate this plugin.
-   ITOM Licensing plugin \(com.snc.itom.license\). For more information, see [Request Discovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/t_ActivateTheDiscoveryPlugin.md).
-   The Datastream Action plugin \(com.glide.hub.action\_type.datastream\), which is automatically installed.
-   Observability Commons for CMDB \(sn\_observability\), which is only required for event ingestion. This must be installed prior to installing the connector for Event Management to work. For more information, see [Observability Commons for CMDB](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/97e04562072020107add6a77c4a9351a) on the ServiceNow Store.

**Note:** If you have an earlier version of the Service Graph Connector for Observability - Datadog, then don’t migrate data from the old connector. You must uninstall the previous version and run the new integration.

Role required: SGC-Admin \(sn\_cmdb\_int\_util.sgc\_admin\) or admin

**Note:** The admin user role is required to run background scripts and to provide access to global tables to the SGC-Admin user. For information about the user roles for Service Graph Connectors, see [Service Graph Connector user roles](../configuration-management-database-cmdb/cmdb-sgc-intro.md#section_ett_spp_4hc).
