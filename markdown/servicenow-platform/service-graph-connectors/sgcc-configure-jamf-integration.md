# Configure Service Graph Connector for Jamf using SGC Central

Use the playbook available with the SGC Central application to set up the Service Graph Connector for Jamf for pulling in Jamf data into the CMDB.

## Before you begin

Install Service Graph Connector for Jamf version 2.13.0 or later from the ServiceNow Store. For ServiceNow Store installation steps, see [Install a ServiceNow Store application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/application-manager/installing-applications-in-application-manager.md).

When using client credentials for authentication, obtain the OAuth credentials from your Jamf administrator. Make a note of the following details:

-   Application \(client\) ID
-   Client Secret

If using Client Credentials authentication in Jamf Pro, you need to use the API Roles and Clients functionality. For more details, refer to the [API Roles and Clients](https://learn.jamf.com/en-US/bundle/jamf-pro-documentation-current/page/API_Roles_and_Clients.html) section in the Jamf documentation. When creating a new API client in the Jamf environment, the **Access token lifetime** field on the form for creating a client enables setting how long the token remains valid. The default is `60` seconds, but due to ServiceNow AI Platform limitations, the value must be set to more than `60` seconds. Setting the token lifetime to `3600` seconds \(1 hour\) helps prevent potential issues.

Role required: admin

## About this task

The playbook experience for onboarding connectors is activated with SGC Central in the Service Graph Workspace or CMDB Workspace. To configure the SGC Central application, see [Configuring SGC Central](../sgcc-configuring.md) and for more information on how to interact with a playbook, see [Interact with Playbook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/playbook-ui.md).

## Procedure

1.  Use one of the following methods to open SGC Central:

    -   Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Service Graph Workspace**, and from the left navigation panel, select the Ingestion icon ![](../image/icon-sgc-central.png) to open the SGC Central view.
    -   Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **CMDB Workspace** &gt; **SGC Central**.
2.  On the Overview page, select **Create connection**.

    **Tip:** Alternatively, you can select **Create connection** on the All connections page.

3.  On the Create connection window, select the Jamf connector type and then select **Create connection**.

4.  Complete the initial prerequisites when setting up a connection for the first time using a connector.

    **Note:** This step is required only during the first-time setup. See [Perform initial setup tasks when creating a connection in SGC Central](../sgcc-first-time-setup.md).

5.  Determine the type of authentication for the Jamf connection.

    1.  In the **Setup** stage of the playbook, select the **Select alias template** activity.

        If needed, expand the **Setup** stage to select an activity.

    2.  Select an alias template for the connection.

        -   **SG-Jamf OAuth Connection**: Select when using OAuth or client credentials for authentication.
        -   **SG-Jamf Basic Connection**: Select when using Basic authentication or Bearer token.
    3.  Select **Continue**.

6.  Enter connection details and test the API connection for importing data.

    1.  In the **Setup** stage of the playbook, select the **Configure and test connection** activity.

    2.  On the form, fill in the fields.

        -   When the **SG-Jamf OAuth Connection** template is selected, fill in the details as shown in the following table.
