# Enable mapping for Cloud Os Image in AWS

Enable the **sn\_cmdb\_ci\_class.use\_single\_cloud\_os\_image** system property to add Cloud Os Image data to the Cloud Image \[cmdb\_ci\_cloud\_os\_image\] table instead of adding the data to the Image \[cmdb\_ci\_os\_template\] table.

## Before you begin

Set the application scope to Service Graph Connector for AWS using the application picker. For more information, see [Application picker](../../application-development/c_ApplicationPicker.md).

Role required: admin

## About this task

In Service Graph Connector for AWS version 2.9.1 and earlier, the Cloud Os Image data was added to the Image \[cmdb\_ci\_os\_template\] table. Multiple records were created for the same image because the Image \[cmdb\_ci\_os\_template\] table is a dependent class. In Service Graph Connector for AWS version 2.10.0 and later, Cloud Os Image data is added to the Cloud Image \[cmdb\_ci\_cloud\_os\_image\] table, which is an independent class, when the **sn\_cmdb\_ci\_class.use\_single\_cloud\_os\_image** system property is enabled.

## Procedure

1.  Enter `sys_properties.list` in the navigation filter, and then open the **sn\_cmdb\_ci\_class.use\_single\_cloud\_os\_image** property.

2.  In the **Value** field, enter `true`.

3.  Select **Update**.
