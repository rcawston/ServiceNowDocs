</table>        3.  Select **Create and test connection**.
        4.  Once the connection test is complete, select **Continue**.
    2.  Set configuration properties for the connection to access the AWS resources.

        1.  In the **Setup** stage of the playbook, select the **Set configuration properties** activity.
        2.  In the Organization details section, fill in the organization details including the account identifier, name and description of the AWS organization.
        3.  In the S3 account details section, fill in the details.

            |Field|Description|
            |-----|-----------|
            |S3 account ID|Numeric identifier of the AWS account that hosts the Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\) bucket.|
            |S3 bucket name|Name of the Amazon S3 bucket that collects the details from Amazon EC2 instances.|
            |S3 region|Region where the Amazon S3 bucket resides.|

        4.  In the **AWS regions** field of the AWS regions and STS assume role name section, enter the AWS regions to collect the CI data.

            By default, the Service Graph Connector for AWS runs through all the AWS regions to collect the CI data.

            You can enter AWS specific regions to speed up the CI data import process. For example, `us-east1, us-east-2`.

            If you update the **AWS regions** field value later, clear the value of the **Last run datetime** field in all the data sources related to the Service Graph Connector for AWS to import a new set of data.

        5.  In the **STS assume role name** field of the AWS regions and STS assume role name section, enter the AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) role name.

            The AWS IAM role name is obtained by the ServiceNow user by calling the AssumeRole API offered by the AWS Security Token Service \(STS\). The AssumeRole API returns a set of temporary security credentials for the ServiceNow user to access the AWS resources.

            **Note:** Enter the IAM role name but don’t prefix `arn` in the name. If you leave this field is empty, the value of this field is automatically set to **SnowOrganizationAccountAccessRole**, which is the default IAM role name for the ServiceNow user.

        6.  In the SSM SendCommand document details section, enter the name of the document that defines the actions run by the AWS Systems Manager \(SSM\) on a Linux-based Amazon EC2 instance or a Windows-based Amazon EC2 instance in their respective fields.
        7.  In the **Management account ID** field of the Management account ID and standalone account ID section, enter the management account ID in the AWS organization.

            Enter a value for this field when the ServiceNow user was created in an AWS member account.

            The account calls the ListAccounts API associated with the AWS organization to collect CI information from all the accounts. For more information, see [ListAccounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/APIReference/API_ListAccounts.html) on the AWS documentation site.

        8.  In the **Standalone account ID** field of the Management account ID and standalone account ID section, enter the ID of a member account in the AWS organization.

            **Note:** When specifying a standalone account, the AWS organization-related data such as the organization name, organization units, organization ID, and service accounts are not imported. To import the full data later, clear any value mentioned in the **Standalone account ID** field. See the [Service Graph Connector for AWS - Standalone Setup \[KB1642159\]](https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB1642159) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

        9.  In the AWS config aggregator details section, enter the AWS account details for the aggregator resource type.

        11. Select the **Is gov cloud** check box in the Gov cloud setup section to indicate that the connection setup is for the AWS GovCloud.
        12. In the SSM EKS SendCommand document details section, enter the AWS SSM document details.

            |Field|Description|
            |-----|-----------|
            |EKS cluster names document|Name of the AWS SSM document to discover EKS clusters associated with EC2 Bastion hosts.|
            |EKS shell script document|Name of the AWS SSM document to fetch CIs related to Kubernetes components, such as pods, services, and deployments, from EKS clusters.|

        13. Select **Save properties**.
        14. Select **Continue**.
    3.  Configure the required EC2 resources for Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service \(EKS\) to import EKS cluster data.

        **Note:** Complete this step only when EC2 resources are needed. Else, select **Skip** for the **Configure EKS EC2 resources** activity.

        An EKS EC2 resource is a bastion host that has network access to EKS clusters. The EKS clusters aren't directly accessible to the connector. Therefore, you must provide the EKS EC2 resource details. For importing EKS cluster data, the connector uses the SSM Send Command on EKS EC2 resources to run kubectl commands remotely.

        **Note:** Ensure that you’ve configured your AWS environment for the EKS integration. For more information, see the [Service Graph Connector for AWS - Amazon EKS Integration \[KB1437138\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB1437138) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

            |Active|Option to activate the EKS EC2 resource.|

        4.  Select **Save**.
        5.  Repeat steps from [6.c.ii](sgcc-configure-aws-integ.md#eks-ec2-add) to [6.c.iv](sgcc-configure-aws-integ.md#eks-ec2-save) to add more EKS EC2 resources.
        6.  Select **Continue**.
    4.  Run the AWS diagnostic tool before running a scheduled import job to identify any issues in the AWS environment setup.

        1.  In the **Setup** stage of the playbook, select the **Run diagnostic tests** activity.
        2.  On the Run diagnostic test page, select an option to exclude the corresponding test results from the diagnostic summary.
