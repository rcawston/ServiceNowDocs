# Configure Service Graph Connector for Observability - New Relic using the guided setup

Set up scheduled import jobs to pull in data from New Relic into your CMDB.

## Before you begin

To use this Service Graph Connector, you need a subscription to a Subscription Unit that is based in the IT Operations Management \(ITOM\) Visibility application or in the ITOM Discovery application. As defined in the section titled "Managed IT Resource Types" in [ServiceNow Subscription Unit Overview](https://www.servicenow.com/products/entitlements-packages.html) for your subscription, for managed IT resources that are created or modified in the CMDB by this Service Graph Connector, but that aren’t yet managed by [ITOM Visibility or ITOM Discovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/itom-license-module.md), these resources will increase Subscription Unit consumption from that application. Review your current Subscription Unit consumption within ITOM Visibility or ITOM Discovery to ensure available capacity.

Dependencies and requirements:

-   The [Integration Commons for CMDB](../cmdb-integration-commons/integration-commons-for-cmdb.md) store app, which is automatically installed.
-   The CMDB CI class models store app, which is automatically installed. See [CMDB CI Class Models app](../cmdb-ci-class-models/cmdb-ci-class-models.md).
-   The ITOM Discovery License plugin \(com.snc.itom.discovery.license\). You must activate this plugin.
-   ITOM Licensing plugin \(com.snc.itom.license\). For more information, see [Request Discovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/t_ActivateTheDiscoveryPlugin.md).
-   The Datastream Action plugin \(com.glide.hub.action\_type.datastream\), which is automatically installed.
-   Observability Commons for CMDB \(sn\_observability\), which is only required for event ingestion. This must be installed prior to installing the connector for Event Management to work. For more information, see [Observability Commons for CMDB](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/97e04562072020107add6a77c4a9351a) on the ServiceNow Store.

**Note:** If you have an earlier version of the Service Graph Connector for Observability - New Relic, then don’t migrate data from the old connector. You must uninstall the previous version and run the new integration.

Role required: SGC-Admin \(sn\_cmdb\_int\_util.sgc\_admin\) or admin

**Note:** The admin user role is required to run background scripts and to provide access to global tables to the SGC-Admin user. For information about the user roles for Service Graph Connectors, see [Service Graph Connector user roles](../configuration-management-database-cmdb/cmdb-sgc-intro.md#section_ett_spp_4hc).

</table>        5.  Select **Configure Connection**.

            **Note:** The Service Graph Connector for Observability - New Relic supports connection to a single New Relic instance only. So, you can use the single default connection only.

        6.  Return to the Configure the connection task page using the back button for your browser.
        7.  Set the Configure connection and credentials task to complete by selecting **Mark as Complete**.
    2.  Test the NerdGraph API connection to import data from the New Relic application.

        1.  In the Configure the Connection section of the New Relic Integration with CMDB page, select **Continue**.
        2.  For the Test Connection task, select **Configure**.
        3.  Test the connection by selecting the **Test Connection** related link.

            Testing the connection might take a few moments. The page is refreshed to show the test results.

        4.  When the **Status** field is set to **Success**, select **Update**.

            If any of the tests have errors, follow the suggestions for remediation.

        5.  Set the Test Connection task to complete by selecting **Mark as Complete**.
