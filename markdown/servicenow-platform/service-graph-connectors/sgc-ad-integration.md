## Use cases

Import computer and software details about your assets from the Microsoft Active Directory product into your CMDB.

## Guided setup

The guided setup for the Service Graph Connector for Active Directory provides an organized sequence of tasks to configure the integration on your instance. To access the guided setup, [Configure Service Graph Connector for Active Directory](sgc-ad-configure.md).

## CMDB integrations dashboard

The Integration Commons for CMDB store app provides a dashboard with a central view of the status, processing results, and processing errors of all installed integrations. You can see metrics for all integration runs. You can filter the view to a specific CMDB integration, a specific time duration, or a specific integration run. For more details about monitoring Microsoft Active Directory integrations in the CMDB Integrations Dashboard, see [Using the CMDB Integrations Dashboard](../cmdb-integration-commons/integration-commons-for-cmdb.md#section_fxg_lh4_blb).

## Data mapping

Data from the Service Graph Connector for Active Directory data sources is mapped and transformed into the ServiceNow CMDB Configuration Item \(CI\) class definitions using the Robust Transform Engine \(RTE\). Data is inserted into the ServiceNow CMDB using the Identification and Reconciliation Engine \(IRE\).

After you complete the guided setup, you configure the integration to periodically pull data from the Active Directory. The data is loaded into the following tables.

You can use the Integration Hub ETL application to view the data maps.
