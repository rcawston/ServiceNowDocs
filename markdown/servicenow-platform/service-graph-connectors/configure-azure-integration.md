# Configure Service Graph Connector for Microsoft Azure using the guided setup

Set up data sources and scheduled import jobs to pull in data from Azure into your CMDB.

## Before you begin

**Important:** Unless there are configuration issues, use the SGC Central view in the Service Graph Workspace or CMDB Workspace to configure the connection for the connector, as the guided setup method is planned for deprecation.

To use this Service Graph Connector, you need a subscription to a Subscription Unit that is based in the IT Operations Management \(ITOM\) Visibility application or in the ITOM Discovery application. As defined in the section titled "Managed IT Resource Types" in [ServiceNow Subscription Unit Overview](https://www.servicenow.com/products/entitlements-packages.html) for your subscription, for managed IT resources that are created or modified in the CMDB by this Service Graph Connector, but that aren’t yet managed by [ITOM Visibility or ITOM Discovery](../../it-operations-management/itom-license-module.md), these resources will increase Subscription Unit consumption from that application. Review your current Subscription Unit consumption within ITOM Visibility or ITOM Discovery to ensure available capacity.

Dependencies and requirements:

-   The [Integration Commons for CMDB](../cmdb-integration-commons/integration-commons-for-cmdb.md) store app, which is automatically installed.
-   The CMDB CI class models store app, which is automatically installed. See [CMDB CI Class Models app](../cmdb-ci-class-models/cmdb-ci-class-models.md).
-   Discovery Core plugin \(com.snc.discovery.core\), which is automatically installed by Discovery.
-   The Datastream Action plugin \(com.glide.hub.action\_type.datastream\), which is automatically installed.
-   The ITOM Discovery License plugin \(com.snc.itom.discovery.license\). You must activate this plugin.
-   ITOM Licensing plugin \(com.snc.itom.license\). For more information, see [Request Discovery](../../it-operations-management/discovery/t_ActivateTheDiscoveryPlugin.md).

**Important:** After the initial import of Azure data, the application performs a delta import of data. However, you can perform a full pull of data anytime later by disabling the delta synchronization and setting the **sn\_sg\_azure\_integ.is\_delta\_sync\_enabled** property to `false`. For more information, see [Configuring data synchronization in Service Graph Connector for Microsoft Azure](sgc-cmdb-azure-data-sync.md#).

Role required: SGC-Admin \(sn\_cmdb\_int\_util.sgc\_admin\) or admin

**Note:** The admin user role is required to run background scripts and to provide access to global tables to the SGC-Admin user. For information about the user roles for Service Graph Connectors, see [Service Graph Connector user roles](../configuration-management-database-cmdb/cmdb-sgc-intro.md#service-graph-connector-user-roles).

## About this task

The connector uses the Azure Management APIs for the complete pull of data from Azure. However, to pull delta changes from Azure, the Azure Resource Graph APIs are used. The domain name system \(DNS\) is Microsoft Azure Management, but the path is a resource graph.

For more information on the Azure setup instructions, see the [Service Graph Connector for Azure - Overview](https://www.servicenow.com/community/cmdb-articles/service-graph-connector-for-azure-overview/ta-p/2301822) and [How do I configure the Azure Service Graph Connector?](https://www.servicenow.com/community/cmdb-articles/azure-service-graph-connector-version-1-12/ta-p/3308034) articles on the ServiceNow Community site.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Graph Connectors** &gt; **Azure** &gt; **Setup**.

2.  On the Getting started page, select **Get Started**.

3.  Create data sources and scheduled imports for the new connection.

    1.  On the Service Graph Connector for Microsoft Azure page, in the Update Data Sources and Scheduled Imports Access, select the task **Update Scheduled Data Import Access**.

    2.  In the Update Scheduled Data Import Access section, select **Configure** and do the following:

        1.  For the Update Scheduled Data Import access task, select **Configure**.
        2.  Select the **Global** application scope by using the application picker.
        3.  In the Application Access related list, select the **Can create**, **Can update**, and **Can delete** check boxes, if not already selected.
        4.  Select **Update** to close the tab and return to the guided setup.
        5.  Modify the application scope again to **Service Graph Connector for Microsoft Azure** by using the application picker.
        6.  Set the Update Scheduled Data Import access task to complete by selecting **Mark as Complete**.
        7.  Repeat the steps [3.b.ii](configure-azure-integration.md#global) to [3.b.v](configure-azure-integration.md#app) for the Update Data Source Access task with the Data Source \[sys\_data\_source\] table and set the task to complete by selecting **Mark as Complete**.
    3.  Clear the cache for the new connection.

        1.  In the Clear Cache for Datasource and Import set section, select **Configure**.
        2.  In the **Run script** text box of the background script page, enter the following script:

            ```
            GlideTableManager.invalidateTable("sys_data_source");
                  GlideCacheManager.flushTable("sys_data_source");
            
                  GlideTableManager.invalidateTable("scheduled_import_set");
                  GlideCacheManager.flushTable("scheduled_import_set");
            
                  GlideTableManager.invalidateTable("sys_db_object");
                  GlideCacheManager.flushTable("sys_db_object");
            ```

        3.  Select **Run Script** to run the background script in the **global** scope.

            The script may take several minutes to execute.

        4.  After the script is executed, select **Close**.
        5.  From the application picker, select the **Service Graph Connector for Microsoft Azure** application.
        6.  Select **Mark as Complete**.
4.  Create a connection to import hardware configuration items \(CIs\) from the Azure client application.

    **Note:** Ensure that you have the `User.Read` permission on the Microsoft Graph API for the hardware import.Also, ensure that the IAM policy for the Azure subscription has the Reader role. See [Assign a user as an administrator of an Azure subscription with conditions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal-subscription-admin) on the Microsoft Azure documentation site.
