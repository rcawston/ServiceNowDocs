# Set partition size for parallel loading-enabled Azure accounts

Optimize the performance of data sources by setting the partition size in the **azure\_full\_pull\_partition\_size** system property.

## Before you begin

Set the application scope to Service Graph Connector for Microsoft Azure using the application picker. For more information, see [Application picker](../../application-development/c_ApplicationPicker.md).

Role required: admin

## About this task

The parallel loading feature is available for the following data sources:

-   Starting with the Service Graph Connector for Microsoft Azure 1.13.0 version:
    -   SG-Azure Functions
    -   SG-Azure Generic Resources
    -   SG-Azure Get Run Command
    -   SG-Azure Hardware Template Updation​
    -   SG-Azure HW Consolidation​
    -   SG-Azure Kubernetes Cluster
    -   SG-Azure Load Balancers
    -   SG-Azure Network Interface
    -   SG-Azure Public IP Address
    -   SG-Azure Run Command
    -   SG-Azure Scale Sets VMs
-   Starting with the Service Graph Connector for Microsoft Azure 1.11.0 version:
    -   SG-Azure Network
    -   SG-Azure Virtual Machines
    -   SG-Azure Storage Volume

For a full data pull, the **azure\_full\_pull\_partition\_size** property determines the number of Azure subscriptions that can be executed as parallel jobs to retrieve configuration item \(CI\) data. Partition size determines how many Azure subscriptions a single parallel-thread evaluates for data retrieval. If you set the **azure\_full\_pull\_partition\_size** property to `100`, the partition size is 100 subscriptions.

**Note:** If the **azure\_full\_pull\_partition\_size** property isn't configured, the partition size computation feature of the Integration Commons for CMDB application automatically determines the partition size for parallel loading at runtime. See [Partition size computation for parallel loading in Integration Commons for CMDB](../cmdb-integration-commons/integration-commons-part-size.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Graph Connectors** &gt; **Azure** &gt; **Connections**.

2.  From the **Name** column of the Service Graph Connections list, select a connection.

3.  From the **Property** column of the Service Graph Connection Properties related list, select **azure\_full\_pull\_partition\_size**.

    The **azure\_full\_pull\_partition\_size** system property determines the number of subscriptions that each partition processes for a full pull. For more information, see [Service Graph Connector for Microsoft Azure properties](cmdb-sgc-azure-props.md).

4.  In the **Value** field, enter a numeric value greater than `0` for the partition size.

5.  Select **Update**.

    **Note:** After you enable parallel data loading for a data source, the **Test Load 20 Records** and **Load All Records** options don't work for executing the data source. You must select **Execute Now** from **Scheduled Data Import** to execute the data source for which parallel loading is enabled.
