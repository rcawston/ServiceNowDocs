# Configure Service Graph Connector for SolarWinds using SGC Central

Use the playbook available with the SGC Central application to set up the Service Graph Connector for SolarWinds for pulling in SolarWinds data into the CMDB.

## Before you begin

Install Service Graph Connector for SolarWinds version 2.6.0 or later from the ServiceNow Store. For ServiceNow Store installation steps, see [Install a ServiceNow Store application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/application-manager/installing-applications-in-application-manager.md).

Air gap connections are available from version 2.5.0 of the Service Graph Connector for SolarWinds. You can set up either standard data sources or air gap data sources. Before you set up air gap data sources, you must configure the air gap solution for the Service Graph Connector for SolarWinds in your high-secure server and low-secure server. See [Configuring air gap connections for Service Graph Connector for SolarWinds](airgap-solarwinds.md).

Role required: admin

## About this task

The playbook experience for onboarding connectors is activated with SGC Central in the Service Graph Workspace or CMDB Workspace. To configure the SGC Central application, see [Configuring SGC Central](../sgcc-configuring.md) and for more information on how to interact with a playbook, see [Interact with Playbook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/playbook-ui.md).

## Procedure

1.  Use one of the following methods to open SGC Central:

    -   Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Service Graph Workspace**, and from the left navigation panel, select the Ingestion icon ![](../image/icon-sgc-central.png) to open the SGC Central view.
    -   Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **CMDB Workspace** &gt; **SGC Central**.
2.  On the Dashboard page, select **Create connection**.

    **Tip:** Alternatively, you can select **Create connection** on the All connections page.

3.  On the Create connection window, select the SolarWinds connector type, and then select **Create connection**.

4.  Complete the initial prerequisites when setting up a connection for the first time using a connector.

    **Note:** This step is required only during the first-time setup. See [Perform initial setup tasks when creating a connection in SGC Central](../sgcc-first-time-setup.md).

5.  Complete the setup for configuring the connector for importing data.

    1.  Select the data source type.

        1.  In the **Setup** stage of the playbook, select the **Select data source type** activity.
            -   Select **Standard data sources** if you're working with environments that have direct internet access.

                Proceed to step [5.c](sgcc-configure-solarwinds-integ.md#substep_j4h_31n_xfc).

            -   Select **Air gap data sources** if you're working with restricted environments that don't have direct internet access.
        2.  Select **Continue**.
    2.  Download and run the PowerShell scripts to set up an air gap connection.

        **Note:** Before you add an air gap connection, you must configure the air gap solution for the Service Graph Connector for SolarWinds in your high-secure and low-secure servers. See [Configuring air gap connections for Service Graph Connector for SolarWinds](airgap-solarwinds.md).

        1.  In the **Setup** stage of the playbook, select the **Download PowerShell scripts** activity.

            The **Download PowerShell scripts** activity appears only when you select **Air gap data sources** as the data source type in step [5.a](sgcc-configure-solarwinds-integ.md#substep_flm_l2n_xfc).

        2.  Select **Download PowerShell scripts**.
        3.  Run the PowerShell scripts.

            For more information on configuring an air gap connection, see [Configuring air gap connections for Service Graph Connector for SolarWinds](airgap-solarwinds.md).

        4.  After configuring the air gap connection, select **Continue**.
    3.  Create and test a connection.

        1.  In the **Setup** stage of the playbook, select the **Create and test connection** activity.
        2.  On the form, fill in the fields.
