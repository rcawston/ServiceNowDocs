# Configure Service Graph Connector for AWSusing the guided setup

Set up the AWS environment and scheduled jobs to pull in AWS data into the CMDB.

## Before you begin

**Important:** Unless there are configuration issues, use the SGC Central view in the Service Graph Workspace or CMDB Workspace to configure the connection for the connector, as the guided setup method is planned for deprecation.

To use this Service Graph Connector, you need a subscription to a Subscription Unit that is based in the IT Operations Management \(ITOM\) Visibility application or in the ITOM Discovery application. As defined in the section titled "Managed IT Resource Types" in [ServiceNow Subscription Unit Overview](https://www.servicenow.com/products/entitlements-packages.html) for your subscription, for managed IT resources that are created or modified in the CMDB by this Service Graph Connector, but that aren’t yet managed by [ITOM Visibility or ITOM Discovery](../../it-operations-management/itom-license-module.md), these resources will increase Subscription Unit consumption from that application. Review your current Subscription Unit consumption within ITOM Visibility or ITOM Discovery to ensure available capacity.

Dependencies and requirements:

-   The [Integration Commons for CMDB](../cmdb-integration-commons/integration-commons-for-cmdb.md) store app, which is automatically installed.
-   The CMDB CI class models store app, which is automatically installed. See [CMDB CI Class Models app](../cmdb-ci-class-models/cmdb-ci-class-models.md).
-   Discovery Core plugin \(com.snc.discovery.core\), which is automatically installed by Discovery.
-   The ITOM Discovery License plugin \(com.snc.itom.discovery.license\). You must activate this plugin.
-   ITOM Licensing plugin \(com.snc.itom.license\). For more information, see [Request Discovery](../../it-operations-management/discovery/t_ActivateTheDiscoveryPlugin.md).

Ensure that you’ve completed the prerequisites for setting up AWS. See [Configure the AWS environment](sgc-cmdb-aws-task-overview.md).

**Note:** When upgrading from an earlier version, ensure that you’ve updated the SSM documents and IAM permissions in your AWS instance.

-   For updating SSM documents, run the `SG-AWS-RunShellScript-Setup.yml`, `SG-AWS-RunPowerShellScript-Setup.yml`, and `SG-AWS-RunKubeCtlShellScript.yml` scripts.
-   For updating the IAM permissions assigned to the SnowOrganizationAccountAccessRole role, run the `CreateSnowOrganizationAccountAccessRoleInMemberAccount.yml` script.

Role required: SGC-Admin \(sn\_cmdb\_int\_util.sgc\_admin\) or admin

**Note:** The admin user role is required to run background scripts and to provide access to global tables to the SGC-Admin user. For information about the user roles for Service Graph Connectors, see [Service Graph Connector user roles](../configuration-management-database-cmdb/cmdb-sgc-intro.md#service-graph-connector-user-roles).

## About this task

For more information on the **Service Graph Connector for AWS** setup instructions, see the following articles:

-   [Service Graph Connector for AWS - Setup Instructions \[KB1220597\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB1220597) article on the Now Support Knowledge Base.
-   [Service Graph Connector for AWS - Introduction](https://www.servicenow.com/community/cmdb-articles/service-graph-connector-for-aws-introduction/ta-p/2300757) on the ServiceNow Community site.
-   [SGC-AWS - Release 2.0 Features](https://www.servicenow.com/community/cmdb-articles/sgc-aws-release-2-0-features/ta-p/2511663) on the ServiceNow Community site.

If you upgrade the connector, complete the following tasks before the upgrade process:

-   If there are any customizations, delete the records associated with the Service Graph Connector for AWS from the Customer Updates \[sys\_update\_xml\] table. See [Customer Updates table](../../platform-security/r_CustomerUpdatesTable.md).
-   Upgrade any dependencies.

After you've installed the latest version of the Service Graph Connector for AWS:

-   Perform a full import of data from your AWS instance. Verify that the **Use last run datetime** field value is cleared for all the AWS data sources in the Data Source \[sys\_data\_source\] table.
-   Download and rerun the AWS scripts. See [Configure the AWS environment](sgc-cmdb-aws-task-overview.md).

## Procedure

1.  Ensure that you’ve selected the **Service Graph Connector for AWS** application scope by using the application picker.

    For more information, see [Application picker](../../application-development/c_ApplicationPicker.md).

2.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Graph Connectors** &gt; **AWS** &gt; **Setup**.

3.  [Configure the AWS environment](sgc-cmdb-aws-task-overview.md).

    **Note:** For the Download the scripts task, select **Configure** to download the scripts.

    After you’ve downloaded the scripts and configured the AWS environment, set the Download the scripts and AWS Setup Instructions tasks to complete.

4.  Configure the authentication credentials to authenticate requests sent to the AWS APIs.

    1.  Configure your AWS credentials.

        1.  For the Configure the connection section of the Service Graph Connector for AWS page, select **Get Started**.
        2.  For the Configure the credentials task, select **Configure**.
        3.  In the **Name** field, enter a name for the authentication.

            `SG-AWS-Credentials-Org` is the default credential alias name. You can add multiple AWS instances. However, don’t modify the default connection alias.

        4.  Enter the access key ID and the secret access key in the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** fields respectively.

            The AWS access keys are long-term credentials for the IAM user and include two parts: an access key ID and a secret access key. You must use both the access key ID and the secret access key together to authenticate requests.

        5.  Return to the Configure the connection task page by selecting the back icon \(&lt;\).
        6.  Set the Configure the credentials task to complete by selecting **Mark as Complete**.
    2.  Test the AWS API connection to import data from the AWS application.

        1.  For the Test the connection task in the Configure the connection section, select **Configure**.
        2.  Select the **Test Connection** related link.
        3.  When the **Status** field is set to **Success**, select the back icon \(&lt;\) to return to the guided setup.
        4.  Set the Test the connection task to complete by selecting **Mark as Complete**.
    3.  Update the required configuration properties for an AWS instance.

        1.  For the Update configuration properties for instance task, select **Configure**.
        2.  On the SG-AWS Configuration Properties form that opens in a new tab, review, and modify the fields.

</table>        3.  Select **Save** and then **Close** to close the tab and return to the guided setup tab.
        4.  Set the Update configuration properties for instance task to complete by selecting **Mark as Complete**.
5.  Configure the required EC2 resources for Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service \(EKS\) to import EKS cluster data.

    An EKS EC2 resource is a bastion host that has network access to EKS clusters. The EKS clusters aren't directly accessible to the connector. Therefore, you must provide the EKS EC2 resource details. For importing EKS cluster data, the connector uses the SSM Send Command on EKS EC2 resources to run kubectl commands remotely.

    **Note:** Ensure that you’ve configured your AWS environment for the EKS integration. For more information, see the [Service Graph Connector for AWS - Amazon EKS Integration \[KB1437138\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB1437138) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.
