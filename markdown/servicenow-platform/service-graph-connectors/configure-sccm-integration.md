# Configure Service Graph Connector for Microsoft SCCM using the guided setup

Set up and validate data source connection credentials to import Microsoft SCCM data into your CMDB.

## Before you begin

**Important:** Unless there are configuration issues, use the SGC Central view in the Service Graph Workspace or CMDB Workspace to configure the connection for the connector, as the guided setup method is planned for deprecation.

Confirm that you are in the Service Graph Connector for Microsoft SCCM application scope by using the application picker.

**Note:** If you’re currently using a version of the Microsoft SCCM plugin, see .

Dependencies and requirements:

-   The [Integration Commons for CMDB](../cmdb-integration-commons/integration-commons-for-cmdb.md) store app, which is automatically installed.
-   The CMDB CI class models store app, which is automatically installed. See [CMDB CI Class Models app](../cmdb-ci-class-models/cmdb-ci-class-models.md).
-   Integration - JDBC \(com.snc.integration.jdbc\)
-   Windows MID Server required for access to the SCCM environment.

To access Microsoft SCCM data, you must have appropriate access to the Microsoft SCCM database. You must have sufficient credentials to query the SQL Server that contains the Microsoft SCCM database. You must do the following:

1.  Create a SQL Server account to connect to the Microsoft SCCM database on the MID Server to use the data sources.
2.  Connect to your Microsoft SCCM SQL Server and configure the following:
    1.  Add a new login user name and password for SQL authentication.
    2.  Choose the Microsoft SCCM database that ServiceNow data sources will connect to.
    3.  Assign the db\_datareader role membership to the Microsoft SCCM user.

**Note:** If you have the Service Graph Connector for Microsoft SCCM version 2.1.6 or earlier versions installed in your production environment, contact Customer Service and Support for additional steps to remove the SCCM Discovery Source from being included when calculating the subscription unit consumption.

Starting with Service Graph Connector for Microsoft SCCM version 3.0.4, support for multi-instance is introduced, enabling Service Graph Connector for Microsoft SCCM to connect to and import data from multiple Microsoft SCCM instances. This feature involves dynamically creating data sources and scheduled imports, requiring the granting of additional permissions. For more information about how to complete these steps, see [Service Graph Connector for Microsoft 3.0 Setup Guidelines \[KB1001248\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1001248) in Now Support.

Air gap connections are available from version 3.7.0 of the Service Graph Connector for Microsoft SCCM. You can add either standard data sources or air gap data sources by using SGC Central. See [Configure Service Graph Connector for Microsoft SCCM using SGC Central](sgcc-configure-sccm-integ.md).

Role required: SGC-Admin \(sn\_cmdb\_int\_util.sgc\_admin\) or admin

**Note:** The admin user role is required to run background scripts and to provide access to global tables to the SGC-Admin user. For information about the user roles for Service Graph Connectors, see [Service Graph Connector user roles](../configuration-management-database-cmdb/cmdb-sgc-intro.md#section_ett_spp_4hc).
