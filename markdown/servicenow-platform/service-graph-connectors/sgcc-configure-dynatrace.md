# Configure Service Graph Connector for Observability - Dynatrace using SGC Central

Set up scheduled import jobs to pull in Dynatrace data into your Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\).

## Before you begin

Install Service Graph Connector for Observability - Dynatrace version 1.11.0 or later from the ServiceNow Store. For ServiceNow Store installation steps, see [Install a ServiceNow Store application](../../platform-administration/application-manager/installing-applications-in-application-manager.md).

Role required: The following table shows the roles required for each stage of the playbook.

|Stage|Role|
|-----|----|
|Prerequisites|admin|
|Setup|SGC-Admin \(sn\_cmdb\_int\_util.sgc\_admin\) or admin|

**Note:** The admin user role is required to run background scripts and to provide access to global tables to the SGC-Admin user. For information about the user roles for Service Graph Connectors, see [Service Graph Connector user roles](../configuration-management-database-cmdb/cmdb-sgc-intro.md#service-graph-connector-user-roles).

## About this task

The playbook experience for onboarding connectors is activated with SGC Central in the Service Graph Workspace or CMDB Workspace. To configure the SGC Central application, see [Configuring SGC Central](../sgcc-configuring.md) and for more information on how to interact with a playbook, see [Interact with Playbook](../../build-workflows/workflow-studio/playbook-ui.md).

## Procedure

1.  Use one of the following methods to open SGC Central:

    -   Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Service Graph Workspace**, and from the left navigation panel, select the Ingestion icon ![](../image/icon-sgc-central.png) to open the SGC Central view.
    -   Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **CMDB Workspace** &gt; **SGC Central**.
2.  On the Overview page, select **Create connection**.

    **Tip:** Alternatively, you can select **Create connection** on the All connections page.

3.  On the Create connection window, select the Dynatrace connector type, and then select **Configure connection**.

4.  Complete the initial prerequisites when setting up a connection for the first time using a connector.

    1.  Install the Observability Commons for CMDB application \(sn\_observability\) for event ingestion.

        **Note:** The **Install Observability Commons for CMDB** activity appears only when the Observability Commons for CMDB application \(sn\_observability\) isn't already installed. If event ingestion isn't needed, you can skip this step by selecting **Continue** for the **Install Observability Commons for CMDB** activity.

        1.  In the **Prerequisites** stage of the playbook, select the **Install Observability Commons for CMDB** activity.
        2.  Install the [Observability Commons for CMDB](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/97e04562072020107add6a77c4a9351a) application \(sn\_observability\) from the ServiceNow Store.
        3.  After you have installed the application, select **Continue**.
    2.  Create data sources for the connection.

        **Note:** This step is required when configuring the connector for the first time only.

        1.  Verify that you have edit permissions for the Datasource \[sys\_data\_source\] table.
        2.  In the **Prerequisites** stage of the playbook, select the **Update data source access** activity.

        6.  Select **Update**.
        7.  From the application picker, select the application scope of the connector.
        8.  After completing the **Update data source access** activity, select **Continue**.
    3.  Enable creating scheduled jobs for the connection by updating the scheduled data import access.

        **Note:** This step is required when configuring the connector for the first time only.

        1.  Verify that you have edit permissions for the Scheduled Data Import \[scheduled\_import\_set\] table.
        2.  In the **Prerequisites** stage of the playbook, select the **Update scheduled data import access** activity.
        3.  Select **Update access**.
        4.  To edit the record, select the **Global** application scope from the application picker.
        5.  In the Application Access related list of the Data Source form, select the **Can create**, **Can update**, and **Can delete** check boxes.
        6.  Select **Update**.
        7.  From the application picker, select the application scope of the connector.
        8.  After completing the **Update scheduled data import access** activity, select **Continue**.
    4.  Enable creating values for the connection by updating the variable value access.

        **Note:** This step is required when configuring the connector for the first time only.

        1.  Verify that you have edit permissions for the Value \[sys\_variable\_value\] table.
        2.  In the **Prerequisites** stage of the playbook, select the **Update variable value access** activity.
        3.  Select **Update access**.
        4.  To edit the record, select the **Global** application scope from the application picker.
        5.  In the Application Access related list of the Data Source form, select the **Can create**, **Can update**, and **Can delete** check boxes.
        6.  Select **Update**.
        7.  From the application picker, select the application scope of the connector.
        8.  After completing the **Update variable value access** activity, select **Continue**.
    5.  Clear the cache on the Data Source \[sys\_data\_source\] table.

        **Note:** This step is required when configuring the connector for the first time only.

        1.  In the **Prerequisites** stage of the playbook, select the **Clear cache** activity.
        2.  Select **Run clear cache**.
        3.  In the **Run script** text box of the background script page, enter the following script:

            GlideTableManager.invalidateTable("sys_data_source");
                  GlideCacheManager.flushTable("sys_data_source");
            
                  GlideTableManager.invalidateTable("scheduled_import_set");
                  GlideCacheManager.flushTable("scheduled_import_set");
            
                  GlideTableManager.invalidateTable("sys_variable_value");
                  GlideCacheManager.flushTable("sys_variable_value");
            
                  GlideTableManager.invalidateTable("sys_db_object");
                  GlideCacheManager.flushTable("sys_db_object");
            ```

        4.  Select **Run Script** to run the background script in the **global** scope.

            The script may take several minutes to execute.

        5.  After the script is executed, select **Close**.
        6.  From the application picker, select the application scope of the connector.
        7.  After completing the **Clear cache** activity, select **Continue**.
    6.  Verify that the Event Management application works properly with the Dynatrace environment by copying the `EvtMgmtImpactManagerMediator` script to the Global application scope.

        **Note:** This step is displayed only when the Observability Commons for CMDB plugin \(sn\_observability\) is already installed and is required when configuring the connector for the first time only.

        1.  In the **Prerequisites** stage of the playbook, select the **Enable script access for event management** activity.
