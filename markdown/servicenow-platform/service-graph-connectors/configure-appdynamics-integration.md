# Configure Service Graph Connector for Observability - AppDynamics using the guided setup

Set up scheduled import jobs to pull in data from AppDynamics into your Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\).

## Before you begin

**Important:** Unless there are configuration issues, use SGC Central to configure the connection. The guided setup method for configuration is being deprecated.

To use this Service Graph Connector, you need a subscription to a Subscription Unit that is based in the IT Operations Management \(ITOM\) Visibility application or in the ITOM Discovery application. As defined in the section titled "Managed IT Resource Types" in [ServiceNow Subscription Unit Overview](https://www.servicenow.com/products/entitlements-packages.html) for your subscription, for managed IT resources that are created or modified in the CMDB by this Service Graph Connector, but that aren’t yet managed by [ITOM Visibility or ITOM Discovery](../../it-operations-management/itom-license-module.md), these resources will increase Subscription Unit consumption from that application. Review your current Subscription Unit consumption within ITOM Visibility or ITOM Discovery to ensure available capacity.

Dependencies and requirements:

-   The [Integration Commons for CMDB](../cmdb-integration-commons/integration-commons-for-cmdb.md) store app, which is automatically installed.
-   The CMDB CI class models store app, which is automatically installed. See [CMDB CI Class Models app](../cmdb-ci-class-models/cmdb-ci-class-models.md).
-   The ITOM Discovery License plugin \(com.snc.itom.discovery.license\). You must activate this plugin.
-   ITOM Licensing plugin \(com.snc.itom.license\). For more information, see [Request Discovery](../../it-operations-management/discovery/t_ActivateTheDiscoveryPlugin.md).
-   The Datastream Action plugin \(com.glide.hub.action\_type.datastream\), which is automatically installed.
-   Observability Commons for CMDB \(sn\_observability\), which is only required for event ingestion. This must be installed prior to installing the connector for Event Management to work. For more information, see [Observability Commons for CMDB](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/97e04562072020107add6a77c4a9351a) on the ServiceNow Store.

When using client credentials for authentication, obtain the OAuth credentials from your AppDynamics administrator. Make a note of the following details:

-   Application \(client\) ID
-   Client Secret

**Note:** If you have an earlier version of the Service Graph Connector for Observability - AppDynamics, then do not migrate data from the old connector. You must uninstall the previous version and run the new integration.

Role required: SGC-Admin \(sn\_cmdb\_int\_util.sgc\_admin\) or admin

**Note:** The admin user role is required to run background scripts and to provide access to global tables to the SGC-Admin user. For information about the user roles for Service Graph Connectors, see [Service Graph Connector user roles](../configuration-management-database-cmdb/cmdb-sgc-intro.md#service-graph-connector-user-roles).

## Procedure

1.  Ensure that the application scope is set to the Service Graph Connector for Observability - AppDynamics application by using the application picker.

    For more information, see [Application picker](../../application-development/c_ApplicationPicker.md).

2.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Graph Connectors** &gt; **AppDynamics** &gt; **Setup**.

3.  On the Getting started page, select **Get Started**.

4.  Configure the authentication credentials and establish an HTTP connection to send requests to the AppDynamics API.

    1.  In the Configure API authentication section of the Service Graph Connector for Observability - AppDynamics page, select **Get Started**.

    2.  Configure the connection for AppDynamics by editing the default connection.

        You can configure either a Basic Auth connection or an OAuth connection.

        **Note:** As the connector supports only single instance, edit the **AppDynamicsConnectionAlias** connection, available by default.

        -   Configure a Basic Auth connection.
            1.  For the Configure Basic Auth Connection task, select **Configure**.
            2.  Select **Edit** for AppDynamicsConnectionAlias.

                **Note:** If not redirected to the connection setup, search for **AppDynamicsConnectionAlias** on the Integrations page, and then select **View Details** to edit the default connection.

            3.  In the Connection Information section of the Edit Connection window, fill in the fields.
