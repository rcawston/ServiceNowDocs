# Configure Service Graph Connector for Microsoft Azure using SGC Central

Use the playbook available with the SGC Central application to set up the Service Graph Connector for Microsoft Azure for pulling in Microsoft Azure data into the CMDB.

## Before you begin

Install Service Graph Connector for Microsoft Azure version 1.9.0 or later from the ServiceNow Store. For ServiceNow Store installation steps, see [Install a ServiceNow Store application](../../platform-administration/application-manager/installing-applications-in-application-manager.md).

**Important:** After the initial import of Azure data, the application performs a delta import of data. However, you can perform a full pull of data anytime later by disabling the delta synchronization and setting the **sn\_sg\_azure\_integ.is\_delta\_sync\_enabled** property to `false`. For more information, see [Configuring data synchronization in Service Graph Connector for Microsoft Azure](sgc-cmdb-azure-data-sync.md#).

Role required: The following table shows the roles required for each stage of the playbook.

|Stage|Role|
|-----|----|
|Prerequisites|admin|
|Setup|SGC-Admin \(sn\_cmdb\_int\_util.sgc\_admin\) or admin|

**Note:** The admin user role is required to run background scripts and to provide access to global tables to the SGC-Admin user. For information about the user roles for Service Graph Connectors, see [Service Graph Connector user roles](../configuration-management-database-cmdb/cmdb-sgc-intro.md#service-graph-connector-user-roles).

## About this task

The playbook experience for onboarding connectors is activated with SGC Central in the Service Graph Workspace or CMDB Workspace. To configure the SGC Central application, see [Configuring SGC Central](../sgcc-configuring.md) and for more information on how to interact with a playbook, see [Interact with Playbook](../../build-workflows/workflow-studio/playbook-ui.md).

The connector uses the Azure Management APIs for the complete pull of data from Azure. However, to pull delta changes from Azure, the Azure Resource Graph APIs are used. The domain name system \(DNS\) is Microsoft Azure Management, but the path is a resource graph.

## Procedure

1.  Use one of the following methods to open SGC Central:

    -   Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Service Graph Workspace**, and from the left navigation panel, select the Ingestion icon ![](../image/icon-sgc-central.png) to open the SGC Central view.
    -   Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **CMDB Workspace** &gt; **SGC Central**.
2.  On the Overview page, select **Create connection**.

    **Tip:** Alternatively, you can select **Create connection** on the All connections page.

3.  On the Create connection window, select the Microsoft Azure connector type and then select **Create connection**.

4.  Complete the initial prerequisites when setting up a connection for the first time using a connector.

    **Note:** This step is required only during the first-time setup. See [Perform initial setup tasks when creating a connection in SGC Central](../sgcc-first-time-setup.md).

5.  Complete the prerequisites for setting up the Azure environment.

    1.  Complete the instructions required for setting up the Azure environment.

        1.  In the **Prerequisites** stage of the playbook, select the **Review setup instructions** activity.
        2.  Obtain the OAuth credentials including client ID, client secret, and token URL from your Microsoft Azure administrator.
        3.  For importing hardware data, grant the `User.Read` permission on the Microsoft Graph API in the Azure environment. Also, ensure that the IAM policy for the Azure subscription has the Reader role. See [Assign a user as an administrator of an Azure subscription with conditions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal-subscription-admin) on the Microsoft Azure documentation site.
        4.  For importing software data, grant the `Data.Read` permission on the Log Analytics API in the Azure environment. In addition, set up a Log Analytics workspace in the Azure environment.
        5.  After completing the **Review setup instructions** activity, select **Continue**.
6.  Determine whether to import only hardware data or both hardware and software data.

    1.  In the **Setup** stage of the playbook, select the **Select services** activity.

        If needed, expand the **Setup** stage to select an activity.

    2.  To import both hardware and software data, select the **Hardware and software** check box.

        **Note:** Importing software data requires a hardware connection.

        If you need to import only hardware data, the **Hardware only** check box is already selected by default.

    3.  Select **Continue**.

7.  Enter the connection details and test the API connection for importing hardware data.

    1.  In the **Setup** stage of the playbook, select the **Create and test hardware connection** activity.

    2.  On the form, fill in the fields.
