# Configure Service Graph Connector for Microsoft Defender Endpoint using the guided setup

Pull in data from machines using the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint security solution into your Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\).

## Before you begin

**Important:** Unless there are configuration issues, use the SGC Central view in the Service Graph Workspace or CMDB Workspace to configure the connection for the connector, as the guided setup method is planned for deprecation.

To use this Service Graph Connector, you need a subscription to a Subscription Unit that is based in the IT Operations Management \(ITOM\) Visibility application or in the ITOM Discovery application. As defined in the section titled "Managed IT Resource Types" in [ServiceNow Subscription Unit Overview](https://www.servicenow.com/products/entitlements-packages.html) for your subscription, for managed IT resources that are created or modified in the CMDB by this Service Graph Connector, but that aren’t yet managed by [ITOM Visibility or ITOM Discovery](../../it-operations-management/itom-license-module.md), these resources will increase Subscription Unit consumption from that application. Review your current Subscription Unit consumption within ITOM Visibility or ITOM Discovery to ensure available capacity.

Dependencies and requirements:

-   The [Integration Commons for CMDB](../cmdb-integration-commons/integration-commons-for-cmdb.md) store app, which is automatically installed.
-   The CMDB CI class models store app, which is automatically installed. See [CMDB CI Class Models app](../cmdb-ci-class-models/cmdb-ci-class-models.md).
-   The ITOM Discovery License plugin \(com.snc.itom.discovery.license\). You must activate this plugin.
-   ITOM Licensing plugin \(com.snc.itom.license\). For more information, see [Request Discovery](../../it-operations-management/discovery/t_ActivateTheDiscoveryPlugin.md).
-   The Datastream Action plugin \(com.glide.hub.action\_type.datastream\), which is automatically installed.
-   Observability Commons for CMDB \(sn\_observability\), which is only required for event ingestion. For Event Management to work, the Observability Commons for CMDB \(sn\_observability\) app must be installed prior to installing the connector. For more information, see [Observability Commons for CMDB](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/97e04562072020107add6a77c4a9351a) on the ServiceNow Store.

Complete the following tasks:

-   Install the Service Graph Connector for Microsoft Defender Endpoint application \(sn\_defender\_integ\). For more information, see [Install a ServiceNow Store application](../../platform-administration/t_InstallApplications.md).
-   Ensure that you have an active subscription to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.
-   Ensure that you have created an Azure application to get programmatic access to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. See [Create an app to access Microsoft Defender for Endpoint without a user](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/api/exposed-apis-create-app-webapp?view=o365-worldwide) in the Microsoft 365 documentation.
-   Obtain the tenant ID, client ID, and client secret details for the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint administrator account.
-   Enable the Machine.Read.All and Machine.ReadWrite.All permissions in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. See [Permissions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/api/get-machines?view=o365-worldwide#permissions) for the List machines API in the Microsoft 365 documentation.

Role required: SGC-Admin \(sn\_cmdb\_int\_util.sgc\_admin\) or admin

**Note:** The admin user role is required to run background scripts and to provide access to global tables to the SGC-Admin user. For information about the user roles for Service Graph Connectors, see [Service Graph Connector user roles](../configuration-management-database-cmdb/cmdb-sgc-intro.md#service-graph-connector-user-roles).
