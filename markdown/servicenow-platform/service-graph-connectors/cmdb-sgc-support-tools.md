## Key features

The Service Graph Connector Support Tools application includes prebuilt conversations as a response to an issue type and enables resolving Service Graph Connector issues and to perform a general analysis.

The application provides capability to debug and resolve the following types of issues:

-   **Connection issues**

    Depending on the data source selected, asks to update or set required properties, enables to run the Workflow Studio action corresponding to the connector manually, and provides a link to HTTP logs for verifying the response from the data source.

-   **Data issues**

    Checks for customizations in Identification and Reconciliation engine \(IRE\) rules, reconciliation rules, business rules, and mappings. Reviews the field and import causing the issue, reprocesses the import row, and provides the complete transformation information. Also, provides additional troubleshooting steps.

-   **Performance issues**

    Depending on the data source and import set selected, makes a basic performance check and reviews the history of the Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\) integration executions.

-   **Mapping issues**

    Reviews mappings for input and output fields using the IntegrationHub ETL store app.


The chatbot conversation also directs to the knowledge articles landing page in the Now Support knowledge base, if available for a connector.
