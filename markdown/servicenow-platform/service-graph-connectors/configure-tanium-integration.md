# Configure Service Graph Connector for Tanium using the guided setup

Set up scheduled import jobs to pull in data from Tanium into your Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\).

## Before you begin

**Important:** Unless there are configuration issues, use SGC Central to configure the connection. The guided setup method for configuration is being deprecated.

To use this Service Graph Connector, you need a subscription to a Subscription Unit that is based in the IT Operations Management \(ITOM\) Visibility application or in the ITOM Discovery application. As defined in the section titled "Managed IT Resource Types" in [ServiceNow Subscription Unit Overview](https://www.servicenow.com/products/entitlements-packages.html) for your subscription, for managed IT resources that are created or modified in the CMDB by this Service Graph Connector, but that aren’t yet managed by [ITOM Visibility or ITOM Discovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/itom-license-module.md), these resources will increase Subscription Unit consumption from that application. Review your current Subscription Unit consumption within ITOM Visibility or ITOM Discovery to ensure available capacity.

Dependencies and requirements:

-   The [Integration Commons for CMDB](../cmdb-integration-commons/integration-commons-for-cmdb.md) store app, which is automatically installed.
-   The CMDB CI class models store app, which is automatically installed. See [CMDB CI Class Models app](../cmdb-ci-class-models/cmdb-ci-class-models.md).
-   The Datastream Action plugin \(com.glide.hub.action\_type.datastream\), which is automatically installed.

**Note:** If you have an earlier version of the Service Graph Connector for Tanium, then do not migrate data from the old connector. You must uninstall the previous version and run the new integration.

Role required: admin

## About this task

For more information on the Service Graph Connector for Tanium setup, see [How do I configure the Tanium Service Graph Connector?](https://www.servicenow.com/community/cmdb-articles/tanium-service-graph-connector/ta-p/2754467) article on the ServiceNow Community site.

## Procedure

1.  Ensure that the application scope is set to the Service Graph Connector for Tanium application by using the application picker.

    For more information, see [Application picker](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/c_ApplicationPicker.md).

2.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Graph Connectors** &gt; **Tanium** &gt; **Setup**.

3.  On the Getting started page, select **Get Started**.

4.  Configure the authentication credentials and HTTP connection.

    1.  On the Service Graph Connector for Tanium page, in the Configure the Connection and Credentials section, select **Set authentication type**.

    2.  For the Set authentication type task, select **Configure**.

    3.  Specify the system property details for the authentication type.

        1.  In the **Value** field, enable either token-based authentication or basic authentication.

            -   To enable the basic authorization, enter `basic`.
            -   To enable the token-based authorization, enter `token`.
            **Note:** Tanium Platform 7.6.2 supports only token-based authorization for an on-premise setup. To use Tanium Platform 7.6.2 or later versions, enable the token-based authorization type and enter the details for the token-based authorization in the next step.

        2.  Select **Update**.
        3.  Set the Set authentication type task to complete by selecting **Mark as Complete**.
    4.  Configure the connection based on the authentication type.

        1.  For the basic authorization type:
            1.  For the Configure the Basic auth Credentials task, select **Configure**.

                **Note:** The Configure the Basic auth Credentials task appears only when you have specified `basic` as the value in the step [4.c.i](configure-tanium-integration.md#step-value).
