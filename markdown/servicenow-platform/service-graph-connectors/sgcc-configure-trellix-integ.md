# Configure Service Graph Connector for Trellix using SGC Central

Use the playbook available with the SGC Central application to set up the Service Graph Connector for Trellix for pulling in Trellix data into the CMDB.

## Before you begin

Install Service Graph Connector for Trellix version 1.0.0 from the ServiceNow Store. For ServiceNow Store installation steps, see [Install a ServiceNow Store application](../../platform-administration/application-manager/installing-applications-in-application-manager.md).

Role required: admin

## About this task

The playbook experience for onboarding connectors is activated with SGC Central in the Service Graph Workspace or CMDB Workspace. To configure the SGC Central application, see [Configuring SGC Central](../sgcc-configuring.md) and for more information on how to interact with a playbook, see [Interact with Playbook](../../build-workflows/workflow-studio/playbook-ui.md).

## Procedure

1.  Use one of the following methods to open SGC Central:

    -   Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Service Graph Workspace**, and from the left navigation panel, select the Ingestion icon ![](../image/icon-sgc-central.png) to open the SGC Central view.
    -   Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **CMDB Workspace** &gt; **SGC Central**.
2.  On the Dashboard page, select **Create connection**.

3.  On the Create connection window, select the Trellix connector type, and then select **Create connection**.

4.  Complete the initial prerequisites when setting up a connection for the first time using a connector.

    **Note:** This step is required only during the first-time setup. See [Perform initial setup tasks when creating a connection in SGC Central](../sgcc-first-time-setup.md).

5.  Complete the setup for configuring the connector for importing data.

    1.  Create and test a connection.

        1.  In the **Setup** stage of the playbook, select the **Create and test connection** activity.
        2.  On the form, fill in the fields.
