# Configure Service Graph Connector for GCP using the guided setup

Set up scheduled import jobs to pull in data from a GCP project into your CMDB.

## Before you begin

**Important:** Unless there are configuration issues, use the SGC Central view in the Service Graph Workspace or CMDB Workspace to configure the connection for the connector, as the guided setup method is planned for deprecation.

To use this Service Graph Connector, you need a subscription to a Subscription Unit that is based in the IT Operations Management \(ITOM\) Visibility application or in the ITOM Discovery application. As defined in the section titled "Managed IT Resource Types" in [ServiceNow Subscription Unit Overview](https://www.servicenow.com/products/entitlements-packages.html) for your subscription, for managed IT resources that are created or modified in the CMDB by this Service Graph Connector, but that aren’t yet managed by [ITOM Visibility or ITOM Discovery](../../it-operations-management/itom-license-module.md), these resources will increase Subscription Unit consumption from that application. Review your current Subscription Unit consumption within ITOM Visibility or ITOM Discovery to ensure available capacity.

Dependencies and requirements:

-   The [Integration Commons for CMDB](../cmdb-integration-commons/integration-commons-for-cmdb.md) store app, which is automatically installed.
-   The CMDB CI class models store app, which is automatically installed. See [CMDB CI Class Models app](../cmdb-ci-class-models/cmdb-ci-class-models.md).
-   The ITOM Discovery License plugin \(com.snc.itom.discovery.license\). You must activate this plugin.
-   ITOM Licensing plugin \(com.snc.itom.license\). For more information, see [Request Discovery](../../it-operations-management/discovery/t_ActivateTheDiscoveryPlugin.md).
-   The Datastream Action plugin \(com.glide.hub.action\_type.datastream\), which is automatically installed.
-   Observability Commons for CMDB \(sn\_observability\), which is only required for event ingestion. This app must be installed prior to installing the connector for Event Management to work. For more information, see [Observability Commons for CMDB](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/97e04562072020107add6a77c4a9351a) on the ServiceNow Store.

**Note:** If you have an earlier version of the Service Graph Connector for GCP, then don’t migrate data from the old connector. You must uninstall the previous version and run the new integration.

Role required: SGC-Admin \(sn\_cmdb\_int\_util.sgc\_admin\) or admin

**Note:** The admin user role is required to run background scripts and to provide access to global tables to the SGC-Admin user. For information about the user roles for Service Graph Connectors, see [Service Graph Connector user roles](../configuration-management-database-cmdb/cmdb-sgc-intro.md#service-graph-connector-user-roles).

## Procedure

1.  Ensure that the application scope is set to the Service Graph Connector for GCP application by using the application picker.

    For more information, see [Application picker](../../application-development/c_ApplicationPicker.md).

2.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Graph Connectors** &gt; **GCP** &gt; **Setup**.

3.  On the Getting started page, select **Get Started**.

4.  Configure the connection to send requests to the GCP application.

    1.  In the Configure the Connection and Credentials section of the Service Graph Connector for GCP page, select **Get Started**.

    2.  Set up the GCP environment and create a Java KeyStore \(JKS\) certificate to encrypt the security certificates obtained from a GCP application.

        Make a note of the destination keystore password. You need to specify this password while importing the JKS certificate into the Service Graph Connector for GCP application.

        For instructions, see the [Service Graph Connector for GCP - Setup Instructions \[KB1220598\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB1220598) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

        **Note:** After you have set up the GCP environment, return to the guided setup and set the GCP Setup Instructions task in the Configure the Connection and Credentials section to complete by selecting **Mark as Complete**.

    3.  Create an X.509 certificate to associate the JKS certificate for the GCP application with the Service Graph Connector for GCP.

            |Notify on expiration|Users to be notified when the certificate expires. If no users are selected, the logged-in user is added by default, along with the last two logged-in users with the administrator role.|
            |Warn in days to expire|Number of days to send a notification before the certificate expires.|
            |Active|Option to activate the certificate.|

            |Expires in days|Number of days until the certificate expires.|
            |Key store password|Password to access the JKS certificate as noted down in the [previous step](sgc-config-gcp-integration.md#keystorepwd).|
            |Short description|Description of the X.509 certificate.|

        3.  Select the manage attachments icon \(![Manage Attachments icon.](../../../common/image/AttachmentIcon.png)\).
        4.  Select **Choose file** to browse and upload the keystore.p12 file for the JKS certificate you created in step [4.b](sgc-config-gcp-integration.md#jks).
