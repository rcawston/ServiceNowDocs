# Configure the Service Graph Connector for SentinelOne

The guided setup for the Service Graph Connector for SentinelOne provides an organized sequence of tasks to configure the integration on your ServiceNow AI Platform instance.

## Before you begin

To use this Service Graph Connector, you need a subscription to a Subscription Unit that is based in the IT Operations Management \(ITOM\) Visibility application or in the ITOM Discovery application. As defined in the section titled "Managed IT Resource Types" in [ServiceNow Subscription Unit Overview](https://www.servicenow.com/products/entitlements-packages.html) for your subscription, for managed IT resources that are created or modified in the CMDB by this Service Graph Connector, but that aren’t yet managed by [ITOM Visibility or ITOM Discovery](../../it-operations-management/itom-license-module.md), these resources will increase Subscription Unit consumption from that application. Review your current Subscription Unit consumption within ITOM Visibility or ITOM Discovery to ensure available capacity.

**Dependencies and requirements:**

-   The Integration Commons for CMDB store app, which is automatically installed.
-   The CMDB CI Class Models store app store app, which is automatically installed.
-   Discovery Core plugin \(com.snc.discovery.core\), which is automatically installed by Discovery.
-   The ITOM Discovery License plugin \(com.snc.itom.discovery.license\). You must activate this plugin.
-   ITOM Licensing plugin \(com.snc.itom.license\). For more information, see Request Discovery.
-   Guided Setup \(com.sn.ads.setup\).
-   Data Stream \(com.glide.hub.action\_type.datastream\).
-   ITOM Patterns.

Roles required:

-   SentinelOne Role - viewer
-   ServiceNow AI Platform® Role - admin
