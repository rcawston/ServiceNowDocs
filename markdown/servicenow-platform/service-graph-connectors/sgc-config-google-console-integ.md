# Configure Service Graph Connector for Google Console

Set up scheduled import jobs to pull in Chromebook device data from the Google Console into your CMDB.

## Before you begin

To use this Service Graph Connector, you need a subscription to a Subscription Unit that is based in the IT Operations Management \(ITOM\) Visibility application or in the ITOM Discovery application. As defined in the section titled "Managed IT Resource Types" in [ServiceNow Subscription Unit Overview](https://www.servicenow.com/products/entitlements-packages.html) for your subscription, for managed IT resources that are created or modified in the CMDB by this Service Graph Connector, but that aren’t yet managed by [ITOM Visibility or ITOM Discovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/itom-license-module.md), these resources will increase Subscription Unit consumption from that application. Review your current Subscription Unit consumption within ITOM Visibility or ITOM Discovery to ensure available capacity.

Dependencies and requirements:

-   The Integration Commons for CMDB store app, which is automatically installed. See [Integration Commons for CMDB](../cmdb-integration-commons/integration-commons-for-cmdb.md).
-   The CMDB CI class models store app, which is automatically installed. See [CMDB CI Class Models app](../cmdb-ci-class-models/cmdb-ci-class-models.md).
-   ITOM Licensing plugin \(com.snc.itom.license\). See [Request Discovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/t_ActivateTheDiscoveryPlugin.md).

Role required: admin
