# Configure Service Graph Connector for Observability - Dynatrace using guided setup

Use the Service Graph Connector for Observability - Dynatrace to ingest Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\) data from Dynatrace using REST APIs. This connector is the second generation of the Service Graph Connector for Observability - Dynatrace application developed by ServiceNow.

## Before you begin

**Important:** Unless there are configuration issues, use the SGC Central view in the Service Graph Workspace or CMDB Workspace to configure the connection for the connector, as the guided setup method is planned for deprecation.

To use this Service Graph Connector, you need a subscription to a Subscription Unit that is based in the IT Operations Management \(ITOM\) Visibility application or in the ITOM Discovery application. As defined in the section titled "Managed IT Resource Types" in [ServiceNow Subscription Unit Overview](https://www.servicenow.com/products/entitlements-packages.html) for your subscription, for managed IT resources that are created or modified in the CMDB by this Service Graph Connector, but that aren’t yet managed by [ITOM Visibility or ITOM Discovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/itom-license-module.md), these resources will increase Subscription Unit consumption from that application. Review your current Subscription Unit consumption within ITOM Visibility or ITOM Discovery to ensure available capacity.

Dependencies and requirements:

-   The [Integration Commons for CMDB](../cmdb-integration-commons/integration-commons-for-cmdb.md) store app, which is automatically installed.
-   The CMDB CI class models store app, which is automatically installed. See [CMDB CI Class Models app](../cmdb-ci-class-models/cmdb-ci-class-models.md).
-   The ITOM Discovery License plugin \(com.snc.itom.discovery.license\). You must activate this plugin.
-   ITOM Licensing plugin \(com.snc.itom.license\). For more information, see [Request Discovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/t_ActivateTheDiscoveryPlugin.md).
-   The Datastream Action plugin \(com.glide.hub.action\_type.datastream\), which is automatically installed.
-   The Observability Commons for CMDB \(sn\_observability\) plugin, which is only required for event ingestion and must be installed before installing the connector for Event Management to work. For more information, see [Observability Commons for CMDB](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/97e04562072020107add6a77c4a9351a) on the ServiceNow Store.

**Note:** To access the Dynatrace API, you need an access token with Read entities \(entities.read\) scope.

Role required: SGC-Admin \(sn\_cmdb\_int\_util.sgc\_admin\) or admin

**Note:** The admin user role is required to run background scripts and to provide access to global tables to the SGC-Admin user. For information about the user roles for Service Graph Connectors, see [Service Graph Connector user roles](../configuration-management-database-cmdb/cmdb-sgc-intro.md#section_ett_spp_4hc).

## Procedure

        1.  Select **Configure**.
        2.  Update the **Host** field with a fully qualified hostname for your Dynatrace instance.

            For example, `abc123.live.dynatrace.com`.

            The hostname is automatically filled in the **Connection URL** field.

        3.  Enable the use of a MID Server, select the **Use MID Server** check box.

            **Note:** The HTTP connection will be pre-configured to use the API key that was configured during the previous setup task.

        4.  Select **Mark as Complete**.
    4.  Test the HTTP connection.

        1.  In the Test Connection section, select **Configure**.

    For more information on Dynatrace OAuth credentials, see [Authentication for the Account Management API](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/dynatrace-api/basics/dynatrace-api-authentication/account-api-authentication) on the Dynatrace documentation site.

    1.  Set the Dynatrace Grail status to indicate whether using the Grail-enabled tenant.

        **Note:**

        You can check Grail enablement by contacting your Dynatrace administrator.

        1.  In the Configure Dynatrace Grail OAuth section of the Service Graph Connector for Observability Dynatrace Setup page, select **Get Started**.
        2.  For the Set Dynatrace Grail status task, select **Configure** and review or modify the property settings for a Grail-enabled tenant.
        3.  If you've Grail-enabled tenant, set the **Value** field of the **grailEnabled** property to `true`.

            Else, leave the value set to `false`.

        4.  Set the Configure Dynatrace Grail OAuth task to complete by selecting **Mark as Complete**.
    2.  Add a new OAuth connection.

        **Note:** You need an OAuth token with the following scope permissions in Grail:

        -   storage:logs:read
        -   storage:buckets:read
        1.  In the Configure OAuth credentials section, select **Configure**.
        2.  On the Workflow Studio page that opens in a new browser tab, select **Add Connection**.

    1.  On the Guided setup page, in the Advanced section, select the **Advanced settings** task.

    2.  In the Advanced Settings section, select **Configure** and review or modify the existing settings for a custom configuration.

        You can configure the following settings:

        -   Review the page size used in REST API requests to fetch Dynatrace entities.
        -   Define number of days a configuration item \(CI\) can be inactive before it is ignored.
        -   Enter the percentage of an application cluster's nodes that need to be in a state to raise that state to its parent in the service map.

            For example, you can define the percentage of nodes that need to go critical for the parent of a cluster to be in a critical state. If there are 10 nodes in a cluster, setting the property value to `70` would require at least 7 out of the 10 nodes in the cluster to go into a critical state to reflect up to the parent service of the cluster.

        -   Enable ingesting events that do not have a matching CI in the CMDB.
        -   Enable populating the Application \(cmdb\_ci\_appl\) CIs from Dynatrace \(Dynatrace processes\) during scheduled imports.
