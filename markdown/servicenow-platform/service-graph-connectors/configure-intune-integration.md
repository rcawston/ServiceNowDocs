# Configure Service Graph Connector for Microsoft Intune using the guided setup

Set up authentication credentials and a scheduled job to import Microsoft Intune data into your CMDB.

## Before you begin

**Important:** The guided setup method is deprecated from version 2.7.0 of the Service Graph Connector for Microsoft Intune. Use the SGC Central view in the Service Graph Workspace or CMDB Workspace to configure the connection for the connector.

To use this Service Graph Connector, you need a subscription to a Subscription Unit that is based in the IT Operations Management \(ITOM\) Visibility application or in the ITOM Discovery application. As defined in the section titled "Managed IT Resource Types" in [ServiceNow Subscription Unit Overview](https://www.servicenow.com/products/entitlements-packages.html) for your subscription, for managed IT resources that are created or modified in the CMDB by this Service Graph Connector, but that aren’t yet managed by [ITOM Visibility or ITOM Discovery](../../it-operations-management/itom-license-module.md), these resources will increase Subscription Unit consumption from that application. Review your current Subscription Unit consumption within ITOM Visibility or ITOM Discovery to ensure available capacity.

Obtain the following information from your Microsoft Intune administrator:

-   Client ID
-   Client Secret
-   Token URL

For the connector to access the data in Microsoft Intune, the credential information is required to use the Microsoft Graph API. Therefore, you must grant the following Graph API permissions from the App registrations page in the Microsoft portal:

-   DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All \(Type: Application\)
-   DeviceManagementApps.Read.All \(Type: Application\)
-   User.Read.All \(Type: Application\)

For more details on permissions, see [Service Graph Connector for Microsoft Intune - Troubleshooting connection issues](https://community.servicenow.com/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=a405ef9bdbbd7018bb4a474d13961903) on ServiceNow Community and [Microsoft Graph permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference) on the Microsoft documentation site.

Dependencies and requirements:

-   The [Integration Commons for CMDB](../cmdb-integration-commons/integration-commons-for-cmdb.md) store app, which is automatically installed.
-   The CMDB CI class models store app, which is automatically installed. See [CMDB CI Class Models app](../cmdb-ci-class-models/cmdb-ci-class-models.md).
-   Datastream Action plugin \(com.glide.hub.action\_type.datastream\), which is automatically installed.
-   ITOM Licensing plugin \(com.snc.itom.license\). For more information, see [Request Discovery](../../it-operations-management/discovery/t_ActivateTheDiscoveryPlugin.md).
-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Zip step \(com.glide.hub.action\_step.zip\), which is automatically installed.
-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub JSON Parser step \(com.glide.hub.action\_step.jsonparser\), which is automatically installed.

Multi-instance is supported for importing data from multiple Microsoft Intune instances in Service Graph Connector for Microsoft Intune version 2.1.1 and later. This feature involves dynamically creating data sources and scheduled imports, which requires the granting of additional permissions. The guided setup includes additional steps for this feature.

Role required: SGC-Admin \(sn\_cmdb\_int\_util.sgc\_admin\) or admin

**Note:** The admin user role is required to run background scripts and to provide access to global tables to the SGC-Admin user. For information about the user roles for Service Graph Connectors, see [Service Graph Connector user roles](../configuration-management-database-cmdb/cmdb-sgc-intro.md#service-graph-connector-user-roles).

    1.  For the Configure scheduled jobs task in the Set up scheduled import jobs section, select **Configure**.

    2.  Select the name of the scheduled import you want to run.

    3.  On the Scheduled Data Import form, verify the field values for the scheduled job and select the **Active** check box.

        For more information, see [Schedule a data import](../../integrate-applications/system-import-sets/t_ScheduleADataImport.md#table_r53_5hm_xp).

    **Note:**

    -   The SG-Intune Device Reports data source serves as an alternative to the SG-Intune Computer and SG-Intune Devices data sources, importing the same information while optimizing the data retrieval process by minimizing API calls and reducing import time.
    -   The SG-Intune Software Reports data source serves as an alternative to the SG-Intune Software data source.
    -   Both the SG-Intune Device Reports and SG-Intune Software Reports data sources require the paid ServiceNow IntegrationHub Professional Pack Installer \(com.glide.hub.integrations.professional\) plugin.
    -   To enable the creation of attachments, the **glide.attachment.extensions** system property must be set to either null or `zip, json`.

        For more information, see the [Service Graph Connector For Microsoft Intune – Advanced \[KB1641546\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB1641546) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

        4.  Select **Update**.
        5.  To activate the scheduled job for the SG-Intune Software Reports data source, repeat steps [11.a.ii](configure-intune-integration.md#select-job) to [11.a.iv](configure-intune-integration.md#exe-job) by selecting the **SG-Intune Trigger Software Reports** scheduled job.
        6.  Return to the guided setup page and set the Configure scheduled jobs for advanced data sources task to complete by selecting **Mark as Complete**.
        **Important:**

        -   Deactivate the SG-Intune Computer and SG-Intune Devices scheduled imports after setting up the SG-Intune Trigger Device Reports scheduled job for the SG-Intune Device Reports data source.
        -   Deactivate the SG-Intune Software scheduled import after setting up the SG-Intune Trigger Software Reports scheduled job.
        -   Activate the ServiceNow IntegrationHub Professional Pack Installer \(com.glide.hub.integrations.professional\) plugin on your instance.
        For more information, see the [Service Graph Connector For Microsoft Intune – Advanced \[KB1641546\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB1641546) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

    2.  Configure the scheduled import for the SG-Intune Device Reports and SG-Intune Software Reports data sources.

        1.  In the Advanced \[Beta\] section, for the Configure the scheduled import for advanced data sources task, select **Configure**.
        2.  In the Scheduled Data Imports list, select the **SG-Intune Device Reports** scheduled import.
        3.  On the Scheduled Data Import form, verify the field values for the scheduled data import and select the **Active** check box.

            For more information, see [Schedule a data import](../../integrate-applications/system-import-sets/t_ScheduleADataImport.md#table_r53_5hm_xp).

        4.  Select **Update**.
        5.  Return to the guided setup page and set the Configure the scheduled import for advanced data sources task to complete by selecting **Mark as Complete**.
        **Important:** Verify that the SG-Intune Device Reports scheduled import is configured to run 3 hours after the SG-Intune Trigger Device Reports and SG-Intune Trigger Software Reports scheduled jobs.

        Example: If the SG-Intune Trigger Device Reports job is set for 9 a.m. and SG-Intune Trigger Software Reports for 10 a.m. daily, schedule the SG-Intune Device Reports scheduled import for 1 p.m. daily.

    3.  When using multiple instances, update the permissions on the Scheduled Script Execution \[sys\_autoscript\] table so that you can add scheduled jobs for the new connections.
