# Configure Service Graph Connector for SolarWinds

Set up authentication credentials and scheduled jobs to import SolarWinds data into your CMDB.

## Before you begin

**Important:** Unless there are configuration issues, use the SGC Central view in the Service Graph Workspace or CMDB Workspace to configure the connection for the connector, as the guided setup method is planned for deprecation.

To use this Service Graph Connector, you need a subscription to a Subscription Unit that is based in the IT Operations Management \(ITOM\) Visibility application or in the ITOM Discovery application. As defined in the section titled "Managed IT Resource Types" in [ServiceNow Subscription Unit Overview](https://www.servicenow.com/products/entitlements-packages.html) for your subscription, for managed IT resources that are created or modified in the CMDB by this Service Graph Connector, but that aren’t yet managed by [ITOM Visibility or ITOM Discovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/itom-license-module.md), these resources will increase Subscription Unit consumption from that application. Review your current Subscription Unit consumption within ITOM Visibility or ITOM Discovery to ensure available capacity.

Before you start the configuration, navigate to **System Definition** &gt; **Business Rules**, and deactivate the **ValidateServiceAccountID** business rule.

Air gap connections are available from version 2.5.0 of the Service Graph Connector for SolarWinds. You can set up either regular data sources or air gap data sources. Before you set up air gap data sources, you must configure the air gap solution for the Service Graph Connector for SolarWinds in your high-secure server and low-secure server. See [Configuring air gap connections for Service Graph Connector for SolarWinds](airgap-solarwinds.md).

Dependencies and requirements:

-   The [Integration Commons for CMDB](../cmdb-integration-commons/integration-commons-for-cmdb.md) store app, which is automatically installed.
