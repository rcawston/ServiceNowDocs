# Configure Service Graph Connector for Jamf using the guided setup

Set up authentication credentials and scheduled jobs to import Jamf data into your Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\).

## Before you begin

**Important:** Unless there are configuration issues, use the SGC Central view in the Service Graph Workspace or CMDB Workspace to configure the connection for the connector, as the guided setup method is planned for deprecation.

To use this Service Graph Connector, you need a subscription to a Subscription Unit that is based in the IT Operations Management \(ITOM\) Visibility application or in the ITOM Discovery application. As defined in the section titled "Managed IT Resource Types" in [ServiceNow Subscription Unit Overview](https://www.servicenow.com/products/entitlements-packages.html) for your subscription, for managed IT resources that are created or modified in the CMDB by this Service Graph Connector, but that aren’t yet managed by [ITOM Visibility or ITOM Discovery](../../it-operations-management/itom-license-module.md), these resources will increase Subscription Unit consumption from that application. Review your current Subscription Unit consumption within ITOM Visibility or ITOM Discovery to ensure available capacity.

Dependencies and requirements:

-   The [Integration Commons for CMDB](../cmdb-integration-commons/integration-commons-for-cmdb.md) store app, which is automatically installed.
-   The CMDB CI class models store app, which is automatically installed. See [CMDB CI Class Models app](../cmdb-ci-class-models/cmdb-ci-class-models.md).
-   ITOM Licensing plugin \(com.snc.itom.license\). An unlicensed plugin that contains computation logic for SU consumption as necessary. For more information, see [Request Discovery](../../it-operations-management/discovery/t_ActivateTheDiscoveryPlugin.md).
-   Jamf Classic API version 10.x.

When using client credentials for authentication, obtain the OAuth credentials from your Jamf administrator. Make a note of the following details:

-   Application \(client\) ID
-   Client Secret

If using Client Credentials authentication in Jamf Pro, you need to utilize the API Roles and Clients functionality. For more details, refer to the [API Roles and Clients](https://learn.jamf.com/en-US/bundle/jamf-pro-documentation-current/page/API_Roles_and_Clients.html) section in the Jamf documentation. When creating a new API client in the Jamf environment, the **Access token lifetime** field on the form for creating a client enables setting how long the token remains valid. The default is `60` seconds, but due to ServiceNow AI Platform limitations, the value must be set to more than `60` seconds. Setting the token lifetime to `3600` seconds \(1 hour\) helps prevent potential issues.

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Graph Connectors** &gt; **Jamf** &gt; **Setup**.

2.  On the Getting Started page, select **Get started**.

3.  Set configuration properties.

    1.  On the Service Graph Connector for Jamf page, in the Set configuration properties section, select **Configure JSON data size limit**.

    2.  For the Configure JSON data size limit task, select **Configure**.

    3.  Select the **Global** application scope from the application picker.

    4.  Set the `com.glide.transform.json.max-partial-length` system property value.

        -   To create a system property, select **New** and enter `com.glide.transform.json.max-partial-length` as the name and `65536` as the value of the property.
        -   If the **com.glide.transform.json.max-partial-length** property already exists, verify that its value is set to `65536`.
    5.  Set the Configure JSON data size limit task to complete by selecting **Mark as Complete**.

4.  Configure the authentication credentials and HTTP connection for sending requests to the Jamf API.

    1.  Enter Basic or Bearer token authentication details.

        **Important:** Skip this step if using Client credentials for authentication, and instead go to step [4.c](configure-jamf-integration.md#client-credentials).

        1.  For the Configure Jamf authentication: Basic or Bearer token authentication task, select **Configure**.
        2.  On the form, fill in the fields.

</table>    4.  Test the connection.

        1.  For the Test connection task, select **Configure**.
        2.  Review the properties in the Service Graph Connection Properties related list.

            **Note:** The properties in the Service Graph Connection Properties related list of the connection record are modifiable. Be sure to complete the guided setup, review the property descriptions, and follow the instructions carefully before making any changes to them.

            -   For Basic authentication, set the **auth\_type** property value to `basic` \(applicable only for Jamf versions lower than 10.35. Note that Jamf no longer supports Basic authentication, and it will be disabled for all instances starting with Jamf version 11.5\).
            -   For Bearer token authentication, set the **auth\_type** property value to `bearer` \(available in Jamf version 10.35 or higher\).
            -   For Client credentials \(OAuth 2.0\) authentication, set the **auth\_type** property value to `oauth` \(available in Jamf version 10.49 or higher\).
            -   If no authentication type is selected, the connector defaults to Bearer token authentication.
        3.  Test the connection by selecting the **Test Load 20 Records** related link.

            Testing the connection might take a few moments. The page is refreshed to show the test results.

            **Note:** The connection is successful if the **HTTP Status** is **200**. If there is anything displayed in the **Error Code** and **Error Message** fields, then the connection failed and further troubleshooting is required. Do not select **Load All Records** during this setup.

        4.  Set the Test the connection task to complete by selecting **Mark as Complete**.
5.  Add multiple instances.

    **Note:** If you don't need to add multiple instances, you can skip this step.

    1.  In the Add Multiple Instances section of the Service Graph Connector for Jamf page, select **Get Started**.

        2.  Select **sn\_jamf\_integrate.auth\_type** from the **Name** column.
        3.  Set the **sn\_jamf\_integrate.auth\_type** property to one of the following values:
            -   `basic`: Basic authentication that uses a user name and password.
            -   `bearer`: Bearer token authentication that uses a user name and password to retrieve a bearer token.
            -   `oauth`: Client credentials authentication that uses a client ID and client secret to authenticate via OAuth 2.0.
        4.  Navigate back to the guided setup.
        5.  Set the Select authentication type for new connection task to complete by selecting **Mark as Complete**.

        1.  For the Select JAMF Pro version and API task, select **Configure**.
        2.  In the **Use JAMF Pro API** column, for the connection you created, modify the value from **false** to **true** to use the Jamf Pro API instead of the Classic API.
        3.  Update the **Jamf Pro 10.35 or higher** column value to **true** when using the Jamf Pro 10.35 or higher version.

            **Note:** With the **Jamf Pro 10.35 or higher** column value set to **true**, the Bearer Token authentication is used to authenticate the Jamf API. Else, the basic authentication is used.
