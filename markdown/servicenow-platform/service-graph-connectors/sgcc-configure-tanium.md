# Configure Service Graph Connector for Tanium using SGC Central

Set up scheduled import jobs to pull in Tanium data into your Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\).

## Before you begin

Install Service Graph Connector for Tanium version 1.7.0 or later from the ServiceNow Store. For ServiceNow Store installation steps, see [Install a ServiceNow Store application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/application-manager/installing-applications-in-application-manager.md).

Role required: admin

## About this task

The playbook experience for onboarding connectors is activated with SGC Central in the CMDB Workspace. To configure the SGC Central application, see [Configuring SGC Central](../sgcc-configuring.md) and for more information on how to interact with a playbook, see [Interact with Playbook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/playbook-ui.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **CMDB Workspace**.

2.  In the CMDB Workspace, select **SGC Central**.

3.  On the Overview page, select **Create connection**.

    **Tip:** Alternatively, you can select **Create connection** on the All connections page.

4.  On the Create connection window, select the Tanium connector type, and then select **Create connection**.

5.  Complete the initial prerequisites when setting up a connection for the first time using a connector.

    **Note:** This step is required only during the first-time setup. See [Perform initial setup tasks when creating a connection in SGC Central](../sgcc-first-time-setup.md).

6.  Complete the prerequisites for setting up the Tanium environment.

    1.  Create a custom view on your Tanium instance.

        1.  In the **Prerequisites** stage of the playbook, select the **Create custom view** activity.
        2.  Create a custom view on your Tanium instance to be used in the **Select view** activity later by referring to the [Tanium Asset User Guide for Cloud](https://help.tanium.com/bundle/ug_asset_cloud/page/asset/exportasset.html#servicenow_app).

            **Note:** Copy the unmodifiable **ServiceNow \(reserved\)** view from the Tanium instance to create the custom view.

        3.  After creating a view, select the **I have created a custom view for this connection according to the instructions** check box.
        4.  After completing the **Select view** activity, select **Continue**.
7.  Determine the type of authentication for the Tanium connection.

    1.  In the **Setup** stage of the playbook, select the **Select alias template** activity.

        If needed, expand the **Setup** stage to select an activity.

    2.  Select an alias template for the connection.

        -   **Basic authentication**: Select when using Basic authentication that grants access to the Tanium data.
        -   **Token-based authentication**: Select when using an authentication token for the Tanium API to grants access to the Tanium data.
    3.  Select **Continue**.

8.  Enter connection details and test the API connection for importing Tanium data.

    1.  In the **Setup** stage of the playbook, select the **Configure and test connection** activity.

    2.  On the form, fill in the fields.

</table>    3.  Select **Update and test connection**.

    4.  Once the connection test is complete, select **Continue**.

9.  Select the view created on your Tanium instance.

    1.  In the **Setup** stage of the playbook, select the **Select view** activity.

    2.  In the **View** field, select the custom view you created on the Tanium instance in the [Prerequisites activity](sgcc-configure-tanium.md#prereq-activity).

    3.  Select **Continue**.

10. Configure the import schedule to import data at regular intervals.

    1.  In the **Setup** stage of the playbook, select the **Configure import schedule** activity.

    2.  Expand the Parent scheduled data import within the Import schedules list to select the **_Connection name_ - SG-Tanium Usage** import schedule.

    3.  In the Configure import schedule dialog box, select the **Active** check box, and then fill in the run schedule and time details.

        For more information, see [Schedule a data import](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/system-import-sets/t_ScheduleADataImport.md#table_r53_5hm_xp).

    4.  Select **Save**.

        Alternatively, select **Execute Now** to execute the import schedule immediately.

    5.  Repeat steps [10.b](sgcc-configure-tanium.md#parent) to [10.d](sgcc-configure-tanium.md#save) for the **_Connection name_ - SG-Tanium Hardware and Software** parent import schedule.

    6.  Select **Continue**.

11. In the **Setup** stage of the playbook, select the **Confirm connection creation** activity to verify whether the connection was created.


## What to do next

Select **View all connections** to review the connection details. The configured connection appears in the Installed connections list.
