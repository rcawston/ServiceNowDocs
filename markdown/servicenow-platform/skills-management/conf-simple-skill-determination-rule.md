# Create Skill Determination rules to assign skills to work items

Create Skill Determination rules to identify skills required by agents to work on work items and automatically associate them to those work items.

## Before you begin

Role required: skill\_admin or admin

## About this task

You can automatically add a skill to a case based on the product associated with the case if you enable the Product to Skill mapping table \(Skill Required for Model Maintenance \[cmn\_m2m\_skill\_model\]\).

A skill determination rule is created for every new skill required for a work item.

-   If a skill is no longer required for a work item, deactivate or remove the rule applied for the work item.
-   If two rules have the same skill associated with one work item and one rule evaluates the skill as mandatory and the other rule evaluates it as optional, then the rule that evaluates the skill as mandatory is always used.

The table describes the types of Skill Determination rules you could create.
