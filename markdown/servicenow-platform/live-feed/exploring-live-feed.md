# Exploring Live Feed Core UI

Live Feed content forms a searchable knowledge source for sharing information within an organization.

## Live Feed overview

**Important:**

Core UI is required to use Live Feed. Live Feed is not supported in Next Experience. If you turn on Next Experience, Live Feed is automatically disabled and will no longer work. See [Next Experience UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/next-experience-landing-page.md) for more information.

While Live Feed has been discontinued, we are always exploring new ways to enhance our services. Stay tuned for future updates and improvements.

Live Feed content forms a searchable knowledge source for sharing information within an organization. Main features include the following:

-   Users can post, reply to, and rate messages, including links and images.
-   Administrators can set up automatic messages that are generated when specific records are updated throughout the system.
-   Users can subscribe to receive email notifications when new messages are posted.
-   Users who take advantage of the accessibility options in the platform can tab through a Live Feed to navigate.

Live Feed includes different types of feeds, including company feeds, group feeds, individual feeds, and record feeds.

**Note:** Live Feed v2 is active for all new instances by default. If you are upgrading from an earlier version of ServiceNow®, you need to activate Live Feed v2 to use these features.

Live feed can be domain separated at the data level only. For more information on Live Feed and domain separation, see [Domain separation in Live Feed](r_DomainSeparationInLiveFeed.md).
