# Live Feed security and table access

By default, administrators and users with the live\_feed\_admin role can configure live feed security and view all Live Feed tables.

You can also modify the following Live Feed tables:

-   Live Table Notification \[live\_table\_notification\]: Set up automatic messages that are generated when specific records are updated throughout the system.
-   Live Feed Message \[live\_message\]: Modify only if necessary, such as to delete an inappropriate message or restore a message that a user accidentally deleted. This table is typically managed by system functionality.

Extending or modifying data in any Live Feed chat table is not recommended.

-   **[Limit Live Feed access by role](t_LimitLiveFeedAccessByRole.md)**  
All active users in the instance have access to Live Feed by default.
-   **[Manage Live Feed message content](t_ManageLiveFeedMessageContent.md)**  
Users can remove their own messages from feeds. If necessary, administrators can remove inappropriate messages that are posted by any user.
-   **[Live Feed team security](r_LiveFeedTeamSecurity.md)**  
You can restrict who can create teams by modifying an access control rule.
-   **[Restrict hashtag renaming](r_RestrictHashtagRenaming.md)**  
You can restrict who can rename hashtags.
