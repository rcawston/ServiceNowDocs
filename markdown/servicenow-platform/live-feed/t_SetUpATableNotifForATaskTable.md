-   *changedFields*: an ArrayList of fields changed on submit. Use changedFields.contains\('fieldname'\) to check for change.
-   *answer*: set answer to false to cancel the notification.
-   *profileSource*: set to a valid GlideRecord object to define the profile that is posting the message.
-   *profileID*: set to a live\_profile sys\_id to define the profile that is posting the message; by default it is the current record. Overrides profileSource if both are specified.
 Any custom variable created in the script is also exposed to the message in the form of *$\{myVariableName\}*.
