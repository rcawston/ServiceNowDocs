# Scripting for operation handlers

You can use the APIs in the ServiceNow Voice framework to create a seamless voice call experience for your callers and agents.

The CTIOperationRequest API provides methods to set and get data on the current CTIOperationRequest object. For information on this API, see [CTIOperationRequest - Scoped, Global](../api-reference/server-api-reference/CTIOperationRequestAPI.md).

The CTIOperationResponse API provides methods to set and get data on the current CTIOperationResponse object. For information on this API, see [CTIOperationResponse - Scoped, Global](../api-reference/server-api-reference/CTIOperationResponseAPI.md).

The CTI API provides REST resources that enable Computer Telephony Integration \(CTI\) providers to interact with the Voice framework. For information about this API, see [CTI API](../api-reference/rest-apis/cti-api.md).

-   **[Provider configuration in Voice](provider-configuration-ccc.md)**  
For both inbound and outbound calls, a provider configuration contains settings about the involved components and message transformers for a specific third-party phone system provider. Any request from that phone system provider is handled within ServiceNow based on these settings.
-   **[Extension points in Voice](extension-point-ccc.md)**  
Using extension points, you can call the custom scripts to extend the functionality of ServiceNow Voice. While integrating a third-party phone system with ServiceNow Voice, you can invoke extension points using the CTI API to handle events in ServiceNow Voice.
