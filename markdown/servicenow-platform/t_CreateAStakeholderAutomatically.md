# Create stakeholders automatically

You can configure the system to create stakeholders automatically from all category users and assessable records associated with a category using the **Create stakeholders** check box on the Metric Category form.

## Before you begin

Role required: assessment\_admin or admin

## About this task

If you associate a user to the category, the system makes the resulting category user a stakeholder for all the assessable records associated to the category. Similarly, if you associate a new assessable record to the category, the system makes all category users stakeholders for that record if they are not already stakeholders.

**Note:** Use the **Create stakeholders** check box with caution. You can end up with more stakeholders than you want and a large amount of unnecessary assessment data. Automatic stakeholder creation is best suited to assessment implementations in which category users are knowledgeable about all or most of the assessable records associated to each category.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Assessments** &gt; **Metric Definition** &gt; **Categories**.

2.  Select a category.

3.  Associate category users and assessable records to the category.

4.  Select the **Create stakeholders** check box.

5.  Click **Update**.

    All the category users are associated to all the assessable records as stakeholders.

6.  In the **Assessable Records** related list, click **Edit**.

7.  Using the slushbucket, associate an assessable record to the category.

8.  Click **Save**.

    The system makes all category users stakeholders for the new assessable record.

9.  Delete stakeholders as needed.
