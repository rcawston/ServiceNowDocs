# Sharing surveys

You can export a survey and then import it to a different ServiceNow instance.

**Note:** Update sets are available in the Helsinki release and should be used to move data from one instance to another. For information about update sets, see [System update sets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/system-update-sets/system-update-sets.md).

The system exports a single XML file that contains a survey definition \[asmt\_metric\_type\] and the associated records, including the following.

-   Assessment Metric Template \[asmt\_template\]
-   Assessment Template Definition \[asmt\_template\_definition\]
-   Metric definitions \[asmt\_metric\_definition\] \(survey question answer options\)
-   Scheduled Jobs associated with the Survey \[sys\_trigger\]
-   Survey categories \[asmt\_metric\_category\]
-   Survey questions \[asmt\_metric\]
-   Survey users \[asmt\_m2m\_category\_user\]
-   Trigger Condition \[asmt\_condition\]

-   **[Export a survey](t_ExportASurvey.md)**

-   **[Import a survey](t_ImportASurvey.md)**
