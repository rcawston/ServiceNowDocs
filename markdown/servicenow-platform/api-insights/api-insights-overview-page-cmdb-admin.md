# Administering data ingestion and model alignment with API Insights

The Overview tab in the API Insights workspace provides a centralized view of data ingestion activities and integration health.

## Access the API Insights Overview tab

To access the Overview tab, navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **API Insights**. The Overview tab opens by default.

## Required roles

CMDB administrators can access the Overview tab within the API Insights workspace to monitor incoming API data, evaluate alignment with the data model, and take action on misaligned or incomplete data to verify consistent and accurate CMDB records. They can view and resolve errors in connections when importing API data into CMDB using Service Graph Connectors and adjust data based on clustering recommendations.

**Note:** As a user with the sn\_cmdb\_admin role, you need additional roles such as ml\_report\_user and cmdb\_inst\_admin to access some of the features and data.

## Features

Access the various cards on the Overview tab to gain insights on the API data available in your organization.

**Note:** Select a segment or count on a chart to open the KPI Details page and analyze how a specific metric trends over time. To learn more about the KPI Details feature, see [KPI Details](../../now-intelligence/kpi-details.md).
