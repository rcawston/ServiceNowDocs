# Managing application service relationships for APIs

You can associate APIs with relevant configuration items \(CIs\) to ensure accurate mappings between APIs and the configuration items they support.

Application service relationships link APIs to business context and the CIs they depend on, providing clarity on dependencies and improving performance visibility. They enable you to monitor, track changes, and resolve issues more efficiently.

For APIs, application service relationships map how they interact with other CIs, enabling you to manage dependencies, ensure business continuity, and respond quickly to incidents. By understanding these relationships, you gain better control over API performance and the availability of connected CIs.

By using application service relationships, you can:

-   Identify which APIs are tied to specific application services and their related CIs.
-   Understand the dependencies between APIs and the CIs they support.
-   Manage and monitor API performance and its impact on critical business services and CIs.

For more information, see [Service instances \(Application services\)](../configuration-management-database-cmdb/application-services.md).

The available actions for handling application service relationships for APIs include:

-   [View application service relationships](api-insights-manage-serv-reln.md#).
-   [Create application service relationships](api-insights-manage-serv-reln.md#).
-   [Remove application service relationships](api-insights-manage-serv-reln.md#).

**Note:** When managing multiple API relationships for application services, you can automate the mapping. For more information, see [Automate tag-based relationship mapping](../servicenow-platform/Chunk770148849.md#).
