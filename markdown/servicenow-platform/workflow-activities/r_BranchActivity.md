# Branch workflow activity

The **Branch** activity splits the workflow into multiple transition paths from a single activity.

To add a transition path, drag the **Branch** activity onto the canvas. When the Branch activity properties form displays, click **Submit** to add the activity to the canvas. Once the activity is on the canvas, right click in the activity body, then click **Add Condition**.

All transitions from this activity execute concurrently. This activity provides a single **Always** condition. You can draw any number of transitions from this condition. Using this activity is equivalent to drawing multiple transitions from a single condition of another activity.

Branching can affect the behavior of rollback activities. See [Rollback To activity](r_RollbackTo.md#) for more information.
