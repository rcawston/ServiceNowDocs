# Configure a user action for the article view page

Configure a user action for the Knowledge Management article view page in the Knowledge Management Service Portal.

## Before you begin

Role required: sp\_admin or admin

## About this task

The article view page uses the Knowledge Article Content widget to provide user actions. Use the widget instance options to customize these actions.

Ensure that the application scope on the ServiceNow AI Platform is set to Knowledge Management Service Portal.

User actions available for the article view page appear in a menu after clicking the overflow icon \(![Overflow icon](../image/KnowledgeServicePortalOverflowIcon.png)\) in the article header. These actions enable users to flag an article, edit an article, or create an incident for an article.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the Knowledge Management Service Portal article view page.

2.  Control + right-click the article header.

3.  Click **Instance Options**.

4.  Configure the desired settings for the Knowledge Article Content widget.
