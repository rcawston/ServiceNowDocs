# Configure the Knowledge Management Service Portal

The Knowledge Management Service Portal enables users to perform the same operations that are available with the Knowledge Management V3 plugin. From the portal, users can view knowledge bases and articles, search for information, sort and filter search results, and provide feedback.

-   For new customers on the Madrid and later releases, the Knowledge Management Service Portal plugin \(com.snc.knowledge\_serviceportal\) is active by default.
-   For existing customers on release versions prior to Madrid, activate the plugin, if required.
-   Configure the [Knowledge Management Service Portal properties](knowledge-service-portal-properties.md), including the property that directs users to the Knowledge Management homepage in the Knowledge Management Service Portal.

-   Navigate to **Service Portal** &gt; **Portals** and click **Knowledge Portal** \(Knowledge Management Service Portal is named as Knowledge Portal\). See [Service Portal](../../platform-user-interface/service-portal/c_ServicePortal.md) for more information about creating a custom interface.
-   System administrators can configure portal pages and configure widgets for searching, sorting, and filtering knowledge base information. To configure widget instance options and configure search, sort, and filter features, see [Knowledge Management Service Portal widgets](km-service-portal-widget-instances.md)
-   To add knowledge bases to the Knowledge Service Portal, complete the following steps.
    1.  Navigate to **Service Portal** &gt; **Portals**, and click **Service Portal**.
    2.  Click the **Knowledge Bases** related list.
    3.  Click **Edit** to map one or more knowledge bases to the portal.

        **Note:** If no knowledge bases are added, all knowledge bases are available in the portal.

        If knowledge bases are mapped, only those knowledge bases are available in the portal. All search results and all widgets display results from the mapped knowledge bases only.

-   **Note:**

Starting with the Washington DC release, the Knowledge Management v3 homepage \(com.snc.knowledge3\) is being prepared for deprecation in the future Y release. It is replaced by the Knowledge Management Service Portal \(com.snc.knowledge\_serviceportal\), which is active by default for customers on Madrid and later releases. For more information about the new experience, see [Knowledge Management Service Portal homepage features](knowledge-service-portal-pages.md).
