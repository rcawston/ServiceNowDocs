# Manage ownership groups

Create ownership groups and associate them to knowledge articles. Knowledge group managers or knowledge administrators can edit ownership groups.

## Before you begin

The Knowledge Management Advanced plugin \(com.snc.knowledge\_advanced\) must be activated.

Role required: Users with the knowledge\_domain\_expert or knowledge\_admin roles can create ownership groups.

Users with the knowledge\_group\_manager or knowledge\_admin roles can edit ownership groups.

## About this task

Create an ownership group by adding members and a manager. Knowledge administrators approve ownership groups.

When knowledge articles are created, ownership groups can be associated to them. Ownership groups manage article approvals and feedback and can edit and retire knowledge articles that they are associated with.

Knowledge group managers can edit ownership groups managed by them by adding or removing members without the need for approval. They cannot change the manager assigned in their groups. Only knowledge administrators can reassign managers.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Knowledge** &gt; **Ownership Groups** &gt; **Manage Group**.

2.  To create an ownership group, from the Request Type list, select **Create Ownership Group**.
