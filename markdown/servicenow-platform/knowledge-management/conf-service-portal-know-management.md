# Integrating Knowledge Management features with the Service Portal

To create a consistent user experience for Knowledge Management, integrate Knowledge Management Service Portal in your end-user facing Service Portal.

The Knowledge Management Service Portal includes the following features:

-   Multiple knowledge bases
-   A Knowledge Management article view page with feedback options
-   A Knowledge Management search results page with options to filter and sort search results
-   A number of widgets to enable searches, display search results, display knowledge articles, and so on

By default, all knowledge articles in the Service Portal are redirected to the Knowledge Management article view page using the **Knowledge Article View** page route map. If upgrading from a previous release, a system administrator can activate the **Knowledge Article View** page route map to take advantage of the features of the Knowledge Management article view page. For more information, see [Activate the Knowledge Article View page on upgrade](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/service-portal/redirect-knowledge.md).

**Note:** The Knowledge Management Service Portal supports only Zing search and not AI search.

System administrators perform the following tasks to integrate the Knowledge Management Service Portal features with the Service Portal:

-   [Integrate the Knowledge Management homepage with the Service Portal homepage](conf-service-portal-know-management.md#).
-   [Integrate the Knowledge Management search results page with the Service Portal search results page](conf-service-portal-know-management.md#).
-   [Add the Knowledge Management Service Portal widgets to quickly access knowledge articles from the Service Portal homepage](conf-service-portal-know-management.md#) \(Optional\).

**Note:** These configurations apply to the base system pages within the Service Portal only.
