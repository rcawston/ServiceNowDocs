# Knowledge workflows

The publishing and retirement processes for a knowledge article are controlled by workflows defined for the knowledge base that the article belongs to.

You can assign different workflows to each Knowledge Base.

You can use one of the default workflows, or create your own workflows to define custom publishing and retirement processes for different types of knowledge.

For the workflows that require approval, you can configure which users can approve or reject by editing the getApprovers\(\) function in the KBWorkflow script include.

Existing users of Knowledge Management upgrading to Zurich will have access to both workflows and flows in the Knowledge Base form. However, they will be able to use either workflows or flows for a knowledge base, with Workflow being the default option.

Cross selection between flow and workflow for publish and retire is not possible.

You cannot delete the approval records for knowledge flows. You can only approve or reject the records.

 A notification is also sent to authors or revisers of articles to inform them that their article has been approved or rejected.

</table>**Note:**

-   Only administrators and knowledge administrators can view the retired knowledge articles. To reuse a retired article, administrators and knowledge administrators can republish the article. For more information, see [Republish a retired article](republish-retired-article.md).
-   An article and its translations have a parent-child relationship. Retiring a parent article does not automatically retire all its translated child articles.

## Email notifications for approval workflows

You can send email notifications for approval workflows.

-   Notify approvers about knowledge articles submitted for their approvals.
-   Notify authors about the approval status of their knowledge articles.

To send email notifications for approval workflows, enable the **Send notification to approvers and authors in article approval workflow** property \(**glide.knowman.enable\_approval\_notification**\). Beginning with New York, the property is enabled by default. Existing customers on release versions prior to New York can enable this property to send email notifications. Disable any custom notifications for article approvals before enabling this property. If the **glide.knowman.enable\_approval\_notification** property is not available, an administrator can create the property and set its value to `true`. For more information, see [Knowledge Management properties](r_KnowledgeProperties.md#).
