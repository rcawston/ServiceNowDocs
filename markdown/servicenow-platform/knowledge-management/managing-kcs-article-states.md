# Managing KCS article states

Manage the readiness of KCS articles and comply with regulated information using KCS article states.

For information about the KCS article states, see [KCS v6 Practices Guide](https://library.serviceinnovation.org/KCS/KCS_v6/KCS_v6_Practices_Guide).

For information about all the KCS roles, see [Knowledge Management roles](r_KnowledgeRoles.md#).

## Activation information

Activate the Knowledge Management KCS Capabilities plugin \(com.snc.knowledge\_kcs\_capabilities\) to enable the use of KCS roles \(kcs\_contributor, kcs\_publisher, and kcs\_candidate\) and metadata fields for the KCS article state \(governance and confidence\). For more information, see [Activate Knowledge Management KCS Capabilities](activate-kcs-capabilties-plugin.md).

**Note:** If you are not an admin and has either kcs\_contributor or kcs\_candidate roles, you cannot retire an article.

## Article confidence

The confidence state of an article indicates where the article is in its life cycle. Only users with the knowledge\_coach, knowledge\_admin, kcs\_contributor or kcs\_publisher role can modify the value of the **Confidence** field.

For articles existing before the Knowledge Management KCS Capabilities plugin \(com.snc.knowledge\_kcs\_capabilities\) was activated, the **Confidence** field is automatically set to **None**.

If an article is created after the Knowledge Management KCS Capabilities plugin \(com.snc.knowledge\_kcs\_capabilities\) is activated, the **Confidence** field is automatically set based on the workflow state of the article.

</table>## Article governance

The governance state of an article indicates which users can manage articles specific to a regulatory requirement, either experience based or compliance based. Users with contribute access to a knowledge article can modify the value of the **Governance** field.
