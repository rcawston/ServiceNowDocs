# View Log fields and description

The knowledge View log stores the history of knowledge articles views and their usage.

The View log shows who has viewed which knowledge articles and who has attached a knowledge article to a task and when. It identifies final search terms when the type-ahead search suggestions feature is enabled. The View log displays data from the Knowledge Use \[kb\_use\] table.

As an administrator and knowledge manager, you can access the view log by navigating to **All** &gt; **Knowledge** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **View Log**.

The following table describes some of the fields in the View log.

|View log field|Description|
