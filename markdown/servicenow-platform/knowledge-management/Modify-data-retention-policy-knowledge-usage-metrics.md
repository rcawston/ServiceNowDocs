# Modify the data retention policy for knowledge usage metrics

Remove unwanted and older data from the knowledge usage metrics \[kb\_usage\_metrics\] table through the data retention policy.

## Before you begin

Role required: maint and admin

## About this task

Activating the data retention policy for the kb\_usage\_metrics table deletes records that you no longer need.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Maintenance** &gt; **Table Cleanup**.

2.  In the **Tablename** column, search for `kb_usage_metrics` and click the **kb\_usage\_metrics** link.

3.  On the Auto Flush form, activate the kb\_usage\_metrics table cleanup job by selecting the **Active** check box.

4.  Adjust the duration the system waits before deleting the records by modifying the value in the **Age in seconds** field.

    By default, the **Age in seconds** field value is set to 2,592,000 seconds \(equivalent to 30 days\). For more information, see [Autoflush form](../../application-development/automated-test-framework-atf/atf-auto-flush.md).

5.  Click **Update**.
