</td></tr><tr id="valid-to-desc"><td>

Valid to

</td><td>

The date this knowledge article expires. Articles don’t appear in search results after the **Valid to** date or if the **Valid to** date is empty. The default value of the **Valid to** field is derived from the **Article Validity** field configured for the knowledge base \(see [Create a knowledge base](create-a-knowledgebase.md)\). The **Valid to** date starts from the date that the article was created until the number of days specified in the **Article Validity** field. If the **Article Validity** field is empty, the default date in the **Valid to** field for the knowledge article is set to January 1, 2100.

 An article author or editor can select whether to keep or change the default **Valid to** date. For more information, see [Validity of a knowledge article](article-validity.md).

 On the first day of each month, the application sends an email notification to a list of authorized recipients to remind them about articles that are expire in the next month. The recipient can then extend the **Valid to** date to continue using the article. For more information, see [Managing email notifications in Knowledge Management](email-notifications-km.md).

 **Note:** If the system date format or user preferences is set to use `yy` year format, you might face issues when the **Valid to** date is set to the default date. Contact your administrator or modify the user preferences to use a date format with the `yyyy` year format.

6.  Research for content related to knowledge article you're authoring using Agent assist.

    1.  In the contextual side panel, select the agent assist icon \(![Agent Assist icon.](../image/agent-assist.png)\).

        The search results in Agent assist display default content based on the text-based search.

    2.  Click the select a search resource icon \(![Select a search resource icon](../image/filter-settings.png)\), and then select a search resource.

        For example, to view knowledge articles, select **Knowledge Articles**.

    3.  In the search results, you can click a resource item, such as a knowledge article, to view its content in Agent assist.

        **Tip:** For better readability, you can resize the contextual side panel for Agent assist. For a full view of the selected resource item content, select **Full View**. The resource item content opens in another tab within the Agent Workspace.

7.  Check whether your content matches the content in an existing article.

    1.  Enter your search text in the text box available in Agent assist or retain the default text, which is the short description of the knowledge article.

    2.  Select the lookup icon \(![Lookup icon.](../image/lookup-icon.png)\).

    3.  Select a search resource by clicking the Select a search resource icon \(![Select a search resource icon.](../image/filter-settings.png)\).

        -   To find knowledge articles that have high text similarity with the entered search text, choose **Similar Articles \(ML\)**.

            **Note:** This option is available only when the Predictive Intelligence feature is enabled and your administrator has trained the similarity solution for Knowledge Management. For more information, see [Train the similarity solution for Knowledge Management to find related articles](train-similarity-solution-km.md).

        -   To find knowledge articles that match the entered search text, choose **Knowledge Articles**.

        For more information, see [Edit a knowledge article in Agent Workspace](edit-article-workspace.md).

    -   Publish the article by clicking **Publish**.

        A knowledge article is published depending on the workflow setting of its knowledge base:

        -   **Knowledge - Instant Publish**: The knowledge article is immediately published unless it is scheduled to be published at a later date.
        -   **Knowledge - Approval Publish**: The knowledge article is published on approval completion unless it is scheduled to be published at a later date.

            **Note:** With an ownership group associated with a knowledge article, ownership group members can approve self-authored articles for publication. An administrator can override this behavior by disabling the **glide.knowman.ownership\_group.enable\_self\_approval** property. For more information, see [Ownership groups](enable-ownership-group.md).

        For more information, see [Schedule a knowledge article for publishing in Agent Workspace](schedule-article-publishing-agent.md).

        When published, your knowledge article appears in the My Articles - Published and All Articles lists. If the article versioning feature is enabled, the version number of the knowledge article is updated. For more information, see [Knowledge article version numbers](knowledge-article-version-numbers.md).
