# Knowledge Flow

The publishing and retirement processes for a knowledge article are controlled by flows defined for the Knowledge Base that the article belongs to.

You can assign different Flow processes to each Knowledge Base.

You can use one of the default flows, or create your own to define custom publishing and retirement processes for different types of knowledge.

For flows that require approval, you can configure which users can approve or reject by editing the getApprovers\(\) function in the KBWorkflow script include.
