# Managing email notifications in Knowledge Management

Reminders enable relevant users to review knowledge articles and complete tasks associated with them.

By default, the Knowledge Management application includes the following types of email notifications:

-   [Email notifications for knowledge subscriptions](email-notifications-km.md#email-notifications-for-knowledge-subscriptions).
-   [Email notifications for knowledge article approval publishing workflow](email-notifications-km.md#email-notifications-for-knowledge-article-approval-publishing-workflow).
-   [Email notifications for translation tasks](email-notifications-km.md#email-notifications-for-translation-tasks).
-   [Email notifications for expiring knowledge articles](email-notifications-km.md#email-notifications-for-knowledge-subscriptions).
-   [Email notifications for article quality index \(AQI\) reviews](email-notifications-km.md#email-notifications-for-article-quality-index-aqi-reviews).

You can decide if you must receive any knowledge notifications by setting notification preferences. For more information, see [Set knowledge notification preferences](set-subscription-notifications.md).

</table>## Email notifications for expiring knowledge articles

The email notifications for expiring knowledge articles are available when your administrator activates the Knowledge Management Core plugin \(com.glideapp.knowledge\) and sets the value of the **glide.knowman.enable\_article\_expiry\_notification** property to `true`. By default, the property value is set to false.

Knowledge articles have an expiration date set using the **Valid to** field when creating the article. Articles do not appear in search results after the Valid to date.

On the first day of each month, the application sends an email notification to a list of authorized recipients to remind them about articles that are scheduled to expire in the next month. The user can then determine whether to extend the **Valid to** date to continue providing access to the article.

**Note:** To extend the **Valid to** date of a knowledge article, see [Edit a knowledge article](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/xanadu-servicenow-platform/page/product/knowledge-management/task/edit-knowledge-article.html)

The content of the email notification is determined by the number of articles expiring in the coming month.

-   Up to 10 – The email notification includes a list of article links displayed in a tabular format and arranged in ascending order by their Valid to date. Clicking a link opens the article in ServiceNow AI Platform.
-   More than 10 – The email notification includes a **View the list of expiring articles** link, which when accessed opens a list in ServiceNow AI Platform of all articles expiring in the next month.

The following table describes the recipient list of notifications for expiring knowledge articles and the associated conditions when a notification is sent.
