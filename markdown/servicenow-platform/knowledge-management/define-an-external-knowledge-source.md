# Define an external knowledge source

Before you import content, create and configure the connection between the a Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning \(WebDAV\) - compliant external knowledge source and the ServiceNow knowledge base into which you want to import content. Define import parameters for the external knowledge source.

## Before you begin

Define [Basic authentication credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/connections-and-credentials/r_BasicAuthCredentialsForm.md) and [Getting started with connections](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/connections-and-credentials/connection-information.md) to the external source.

**Caution:**

This feature expects that the external source endpoint is a publicly accessible endpoint. Mid-server configuration is not supported.

Role required: admin

## About this task

Only basic authentication is supported for the external content integration feature.

## Procedure

1.  Define the connection from the external source and the target knowledge base.

        |Name|Enter unique name for the external source.|
        |Target Knowledge Base|Select the knowledge base in which you want to create articles for the external content.|
        |Connection Alias|Select the connection alias to connect to the external source.|

    4.  Right-click the form header and click **Save**.

2.  Set import parameters for the external content.
