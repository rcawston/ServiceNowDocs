# Enable actionable knowledge feedback

The actionable knowledge feedback feature is available when the Knowledge Management Service Portal \(com.snc.knowledge\_serviceportal\) plugin is activated and the actionable knowledge feedback properties are enabled.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

The actionable feedback feature is available in the Knowledge Management Service Portal and Agent Workspace. To use the actionable feedback feature in other service portals, you can activate the Knowledge Article View page route map. For new customers, the Knowledge Article View page route map is activated by default.

**Note:** The actionable knowledge feedback is not supported in Knowledge Management v3.

A feedback task is created for an article when the article is flagged. For generating feedback tasks when an article is marked as not helpful or rated below a set value, you must set the following associated properties.

**Note:** When you select **No** on the article form, an actionable feedback pop-up window appears. On the Actionable feedback form, choose one of the reasons to provide feedback. If you choose **Other** as a reason consider providing feedback details.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Knowledge** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Properties**.

2.  In the **Actionable Feedback Properties** section, configure the following properties:

<table id="table_eyc_mnl_kdb"><thead><tr><th>

</td><td>

Enter a value from 1 to 5 to specify the rating threshold for generating a feedback task. For example, if you set this value to 3, a feedback task is generated when a user selects three or less stars to rate an article.

 **Note:** If you enter '0', a negative article feedback does not generate a feedback task.
