# User criteria diagnostics for Knowledge Management

Manage user access to a knowledge base or an article using user criteria diagnostics. Understand what access users have to a knowledge base or an article and determine which user criteria define those permissions.

User access to a knowledge base or an article can be restricted based on:

-   Domain separation
-   Access control list \(ACL\) rules
-   [Knowledge workflows](r_KnowledgeWorkflows.md#)
-   User criteria set for a [knowledge base](t_SelectUserCriteria.md) or an [article](t_SelectUCArticle.md)

This feature considers domain separation and user criteria to determine the user access to knowledge bases and articles.

## Activation information

The user criteria diagnostics feature is activated with the Knowledge Management v3 plugin \(com.snc.knowledge3\). For more information, see [Activate a plugin](../../platform-administration/t_ActivateAPlugin.md).

**Note:**

Starting with the Washington DC release, the Knowledge Management v3 homepage \(com.snc.knowledge3\) is being prepared for deprecation in the future Y release. It is replaced by the Knowledge Management Service Portal \(com.snc.knowledge\_serviceportal\), which is active by default for customers on Madrid and later releases. For more information about the new experience, see [Knowledge Management Service Portal homepage features](knowledge-service-portal-pages.md).
