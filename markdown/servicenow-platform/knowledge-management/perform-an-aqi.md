Perform the Article Quality Index \(AQI\) review to evaluate the quality of the article.

## Before you begin

The knowledge base must have an assigned AQI checklist.

Role required: knowledge\_domain\_expert, knowledge\_coach, knowledge\_admin, or admin

## About this task

Configure the **glide.knowman.aqi.article\_workflow\_states** property to set the article workflow states where you could perform AQI reviews. You can perform several AQI reviews for an article. If you perform several AQI reviews for the same version of the article, the latest AQI score appears in the **Latest AQI** field in the article.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Knowledge** &gt; **Articles** and click **Published**.

2.  Click an article link.

    **Note:** To read the article and perform the AQI review simultaneously, open the article in two separate tabs or window in your browser. You can then read the article from one tab or window and perform the AQI from another tab or window.

3.  Perform the AQI review.

4.  In the **Article Checklist Answers** related list, read the questions and evaluate which ones are true.

    Double-click the **Answer** cell for each question that is true, select **true**, and select the green check mark.

    **Note:** The associated **Weighted Score** is applied to the AQI score when the answer is set to **true.**
