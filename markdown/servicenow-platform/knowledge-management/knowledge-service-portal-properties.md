# Knowledge Management Service Portal properties

Knowledge Management Service Portal properties determine how information is displayed on the Knowledge portal. You must have the admin role to set configuration properties.

The following system properties are set to direct users to the Knowledge Management Service Portal homepage, and to specify the URL suffix for the homepage.

</table>The Knowledge Management Service Portal supports the [Knowledge Management V3 properties](r_KnowledgeProperties.md#). Configuring widget instance options on the portal pages can override these properties.

**Note:**

Starting with the Washington DC release, the Knowledge Management v3 homepage \(com.snc.knowledge3\) is being prepared for deprecation in the future Y release. It is replaced by the Knowledge Management Service Portal \(com.snc.knowledge\_serviceportal\), which is active by default for customers on Madrid and later releases. For more information about the new experience, see [Knowledge Management Service Portal homepage features](knowledge-service-portal-pages.md).
