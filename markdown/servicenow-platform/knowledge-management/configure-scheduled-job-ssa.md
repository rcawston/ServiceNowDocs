# Configure scheduled jobs for Self-Service Analytics

Schedule when to run the deflection configuration to generate the activities that match an activity pattern within an activity window.

## Before you begin

[Set up the deflection configuration for Self-Service Analytics](configure-deflection-ssa.md).

Role required: admin

## About this task

You configure the duration of processing the deflection configuration for a user entity. This configuration is optional for consumers and customer contacts. The scheduled job captures data for Self-Service Analytics and stores the generated data in the Deflection Metric \[ssa\_deflection\_metric\] table.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Definition** &gt; **Scheduled Jobs**.

2.  Configure the scheduled script processed for a user entity in a scheduled job.

    -   For consumers, select **Deflection Analytics for Consumers**.
    -   For customer contacts, select **Deflection Analytics for Contacts**.
    -   For user entities other than consumers and customer contacts, click **New** and select **Automatically run a script of your choosing** to create another scheduled job or modify an existing schedule job.
3.  On the Scheduled Script Execution form, verify the default field values for consumers and customer contacts or fill in the values for a custom configuration.
