# Enable and configure AI Search for Knowledge Management Service Portal

Enable and define the AI Search experience in Knowledge Management Service Portal.

## Before you begin

Role required: sp\_admin or admin

## About this task

All new and existing customers must manually enable AI Search in the Knowledge portal. If you leave AI Search inactive, the portal uses Zing search by default.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Service Portal** &gt; **Portals** and open the **Knowledge Portal** record.

2.  On the form, select the **Enable AI Search** check box.

3.  In the **Search Application** field, select the Knowledge Portal Search Configuration to use for the portal.

    A search application configuration defines search experience settings such as the search engine, search results limit, and suggestions limit.

4.  In the **Search Results Configuration** field, determine how search results are displayed by selecting the Knowledge Portal Search.

5.  Select **Update**.

    **Important:**

    -   The **View count** and **Rating** facets that are available in Zing search aren't available for AI Search.
    -   If you select a Knowledge Base from the Knowledge Portal, you will be directed to the AI Search results page. Because you are not entering a search term, the placeholder “\*\*\*” will be displayed instead of a search term. You can enter a search term on the search results page or select additional filters as needed to refine your results within the selected knowledge base.

## Result

AI Search is enabled throughout the Knowledge portal. Customers can use AI Search from the search bar on the portal.
