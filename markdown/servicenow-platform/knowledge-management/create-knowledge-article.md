# Create a knowledge article

Knowledge contributors can create and edit knowledge articles within a knowledge base to share information across your organization.

## Before you begin

To view an article template, you must activate the article templates feature and enable the desired templates.

Role required: knowledge, knowledge\_manager, knowledge\_admin, knowledge\_coach, knowledge\_domain\_expert, knowledge\_group\_member, admin. You must have contribute access to at least one active knowledge base.

## About this task

Users with at least one role can create and edit knowledge articles. These users are known as knowledge contributors. Users without any role can read articles and submit feedback, but can’t create or edit articles.

Some knowledge bases may allow only certain users to contribute. For example, a member of the IT department can create knowledge articles in the IT knowledge base, such as desktop support information or articles describing company IT processes.

## Procedure

1.  There are three ways of creating knowledge articles.

    -   Navigate to **Self-Service** &gt; **Knowledge** and select the Create an Article icon.
    -   Navigate to **Knowledge** &gt; **Articles** &gt; **Create New**.
    -   From the Knowledge Management homepage, select the more icon \(![More icon](../image/KnowledgeServicePortalOverflowIcon.png)\) and then select **Create Article**.
2.  On the Create new article page, select a knowledge base.

    The list of article templates to select in the next step is filtered according to the article templates available for the selected knowledge base.

    **Note:**

    On the Create new article page, you can select to **Switch to older version of this page** or **Switch to updated version of this page \(recommended\)**.

3.  Select an article template.

4.  Select **Next**.

    The Knowledge form is displayed based on the article template selected.

5.  On the Knowledge form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_fdt_qgf_1r"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Number

</td><td>

Number of the article. This field is automatically set to a number. For more information, see [Duplicate knowledge article numbers](knowledge-article-duplicate-numbers.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Knowledge Base

</td><td>

The knowledge base selected for this article.**Note:** An article can only be associated with one knowledge base.

You can change the knowledge base, but only if the selected article template is available in the knowledge base.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Category

</td><td>

The category for this article. Select a **Knowledge Base** before you can select a category. Articles without a category appear on the knowledge homepage in the \(empty\) category.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Ownership Group

</td><td>

The ownership group for this knowledge article. An ownership group is a group of members and a manager who are responsible for approvals, ensuring article quality, and feedback tasks. Ownership groups can publish, edit, and retire knowledge articles that they’re associated with.**Note:** If no ownership group is assigned, the article automatically goes to the knowledge administrator and knowledge manager for approval.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Language

</td><td>

Language in which you’re creating the article. The list is populated based on the languages enabled for the selected knowledge base.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Schedule publish date

</td><td>

Date in future when the article is published automatically. If approvals are enabled, the approval process must be completed before this date.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Valid to

</td><td>

The date this knowledge article expires. Articles don’t appear in search results after the **Valid to** date or if the **Valid to** date is empty. The default value of the **Valid to** field is derived from the **Article Validity** field configured for the knowledge base \(see [Create a knowledge base](create-a-knowledgebase.md)\). The **Valid to** date starts from the date that the article was created until the number of days specified in the **Article Validity** field. If the **Article Validity** field is empty, the default date in the **Valid to** field for the knowledge article is set to January 1, 2100.

 An article author or editor can select whether to keep or change the default **Valid to** date. For more information, see [Validity of a knowledge article](article-validity.md).

 On the first day of each month, the application sends an email notification to a list of authorized recipients to remind them about articles that are expire in the next month. The recipient can then extend the **Valid to** date to continue using the article. For more information, see [Managing email notifications in Knowledge Management](email-notifications-km.md).

 **Note:** If the system date format or user preferences is set to use `yy` year format, you might face issues when the **Valid to** date is set to the default date. Contact your administrator or modify the user preferences to use a date format with the `yyyy` year format. For more information, see [Global date and time field format](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/time-configuration/r_FormatDateAndTimeFields.md) and [Personalize the system date format](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/time-configuration/t_PersonalizeTheSystemDateFormat.md) topics.

12. Either add to or modify the article details or publish the article.

    -   Add to or modify the article details.

        For more information, see [Edit a knowledge article](edit-knowledge-article.md).

    -   Publish the article by selecting **Publish**.

        A knowledge article is published depending on the workflow setting of its knowledge base:

        -   **Knowledge - Instant Publish**: The knowledge article is immediately published unless it’s scheduled to be published at a later date.
        -   **Knowledge - Approval Publish**: The knowledge article is published on approval completion unless it’s scheduled to be published at a later date.

            **Note:** With an ownership group associated with a knowledge article, ownership group members can approve self-authored articles for publication. An administrator can override this behavior by disabling the **glide.knowman.ownership\_group.enable\_self\_approval** property. For more information, see [Ownership groups](enable-ownership-group.md).

        For more information, see [Schedule a knowledge article for publishing](schedule-article-publishing.md).

        If an article is visible to a guest user, a message appears that reads `This article may be visible to unauthenticated users after it is published. Do you still want to proceed?`

        When published, the knowledge article appears in the Published and All lists. To view the Published list, navigate to **Knowledge** &gt; **Articles** &gt; **Published**. To view the All list, navigate to **Knowledge** &gt; **Articles** &gt; **All**.

        If the article versioning feature is enabled, the version number of the knowledge article increments to the next whole number \(for example, from 2.02 to 3.0\). For more information, see [Knowledge article version numbers](knowledge-article-version-numbers.md).


## What to do next

After saving the article record, you can add tags to organize the article.

After you create and publish a knowledge article, you can perform the following actions related to the article:

-   Request translations for the knowledge article. For more information, see [Request missing translations for available languages](request-translations-missing-languages.md).
-   Retire the knowledge article. Select **Retire** to enable the retirement workflow. For more information, see [Retire a knowledge article](c_RetiredKnowledgeArticles.md).
-   Translate the knowledge article directly from the knowledge article. For more information, see [Translate a knowledge article from a translation task](translate-knowledge-article.md).
-   Delete the published knowledge article. Select **Delete**. If the **Delete** button isn't displayed, select the more actions icon \(![More actions icon](../image/more.png)\), and then select **Delete**.
