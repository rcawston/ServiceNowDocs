# Sample configuration for integrating external knowledge content

You can integrate content from multiple external sources so your users can acquire and search knowledge from a single location. Use this sample configuration to create a connection to your external account, configure external knowledge sources, and import content to enable search results for unified content.

## Requirements for integrating external content

Make sure the Knowledge Management -- External Content Integration plugin \(com.snc.knowledge.external\_integration\) is enabled and your external source is WebDAV- compliant.

**Parent Topic:**[Integration with external knowledge sources](knowledge-external-content-integration.md)

## Integrate external knowledge sources into the Knowledge Management application

Create authentication credentials and a connection alias to connect your external knowledge source to the ServiceNow Knowledge Management application. Define import parameters for your external source to import integrated content.
