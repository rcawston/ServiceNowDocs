# Additional plugins for Knowledge Management

After Knowledge Management is activated, you can activate additional plugins that provide access to various additional Knowledge Management features.

You must have the admin role to activate these additional plugins. For details, see [Activate a plugin](../../platform-administration/t_ActivateAPlugin.md).

**Note:**

Starting with the Washington DC release, the Knowledge Management v3 homepage \(com.snc.knowledge3\) is being prepared for deprecation in the future Y release. It is replaced by the Knowledge Management Service Portal \(com.snc.knowledge\_serviceportal\), which is active by default for customers on Madrid and later releases. For more information about the new experience, see [Knowledge Management Service Portal homepage features](knowledge-service-portal-pages.md).
