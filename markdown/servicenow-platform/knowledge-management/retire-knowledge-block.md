# Retire a knowledge block

You can retire a published knowledge block so that it's no longer available for users to view or search.

## Before you begin

Role required: user must have contributor access to the knowledge base.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Knowledge** &gt; **Knowledge Blocks** &gt; **Published**.

2.  Open the applicable record.

3.  Select **Retire** to retire the knowledge block.

    **Note:**

    -   Starting from the Australia release, you can retire the knowledge block attached to an article by setting the \(**glide.knowman.allow\_retire\_block**\) system property to true.
    -   Any additional steps required to retire the knowledge block, such as approvals, depend on the workflow for the knowledge base. See [Knowledge workflows](r_KnowledgeWorkflows.md#) for more information.
    -   A knowledge block can only be deleted if it's not being used in any knowledge article, including any retired article or previous version of an article.

## Result

The retired knowledge block is no longer visible in the article.
