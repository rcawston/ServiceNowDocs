# Add a custom Localization Framework setting to enable bulk translations

Add a custom Localization Framework setting to translate multiple knowledge articles manually.

## Before you begin

-   [Activate the Knowledge Management Advanced plugin](activate-knowledge-advanced-plugin.md).
-   [Activate Localization Framework](../../platform-administration/localization-framework/activate-lf-plugin.md).
-   [Activate a language](../../platform-administration/system-localization/t_ActivateALanguage.md).
-   Bulk Translation is available with the base Australia release. If you are upgrading from a previous release, you must configure the following settings:
    -   Enable the Localization Framework by setting the **glide.knowman.translation.enable\_lf\_article\_translation** system property to true.
    -   Set the **glide.knowman.translation.enable\_translation\_task** system property to false.
    -   Set the **glide.knowman.translation.enable\_localization\_framework** system property to true.

Role required: admin

2.  In the Setting list, select **New**.

3.  Enter a name for the setting.

4.  Select **Knowledge** from the **Artifact** list.

6.  Select the **Workflow Preferences** tab.
