## CSM Knowledge Management dashboard indicators

The CSM Knowledge Management dashboard provides three views, into content usage, content governance, and content quality.

The Knowledge Management dashboard presents the following key performance indicators:

-   **% of Knowledge Articles Published**

    A daily calculation using the formula `[[Number of knowledge articles published]] / [[Number of knowledge articles active]]`

-   **Monthly Average Article Rating**

    A monthly calculation of the sum of all article ratings for the month divided by the number of knowledge articles rated for the month.

-   **Average select Rank**

    A monthly calculation using the formula `[[Sum of knowledge search ranks]] / Number of knowledge searches with rank]]`

-   **Select Through Rate**

    A monthly calculation using the formula `Number of knowledge searches with rank]] / [[Number of knowledge searches]]`

    The number of authenticated users who viewed at least one knowledge article in the preceding month. The goal is for the number to maximize.

-   **Number of Knowledge Searches with Rank- Monthly**

    The number of knowledge searches in a month where the Highest select Rank has a value higher than zero. The goal is for the number to maximize.
