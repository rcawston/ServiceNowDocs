 An article author or editor can select whether to keep or change the default **Valid to** date.

 On the first day of each month, the application sends an email notification to a list of authorized recipients to remind them about articles that are about to expire in the next month. The recipient can then extend the **Valid to** date to continue using the article. For more information, see [Managing email notifications in Knowledge Management](email-notifications-km.md).

 **Note:** If the system date format or user preferences are set to use the `yy` year format, you might face issues when the **Valid to** date is set to the default date. Contact your system administrator or modify the user preferences to use a date format with the `yyyy` year format. For more information, see [Global date and time field format](../../platform-administration/time-configuration/r_FormatDateAndTimeFields.md) and [Personalize the system date format](../../platform-administration/time-configuration/t_PersonalizeTheSystemDateFormat.md) topics.
