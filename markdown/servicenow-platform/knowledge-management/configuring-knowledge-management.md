# Configuring Knowledge Management

Plan and configure your Knowledge Management implementation.

## Configuration overview

Visit the following page on the ServiceNow Community for information on setting up Knowledge Management: [Knowledge Management Getting Started](https://www.servicenow.com/community/knowledge-management-articles/knowledge-management-getting-started/ta-p/2533067).

You can also use Knowledge Management capabilities within a website built on Adobe Experience Manager \(AEM\). For more information, see [Integration with Adobe Experience Manager](../../customer-service-management/aem-integration.md).
