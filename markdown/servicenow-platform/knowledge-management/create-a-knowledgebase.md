# Create a knowledge base

Create a knowledge base to provide a self-service platform for users to store, share, and manage content. Configure knowledge bases into product or service categories and manage user access based on permissions. Customize workflows for publishing and retiring articles in the knowledge base.

## Before you begin

Understand the [requirements](set-up-knowledge-admin-user.md) for setting up a knowledge base.

Role required: knowledge\_admin or admin

2.  In the Knowledge Bases list, click **New**.

3.  On the Knowledge base form, fill in the following fields as appropriate:

Article Validity

</td><td>

Number of default days articles will be valid for after their created date. **Note:** The **Article Validity** field is configured to set the **Valid to** date for an article. The **Valid to** date is the date this knowledge article expires. When you create an article within a knowledge base, the date value in the **Valid to** field of the article is calculated as follows: Created \(sys\_created\_on\) + Article Validity \(in days\). An article author or editor can select whether to keep or change the **Valid to** date  \(see [Create a knowledge article](create-knowledge-article.md)\). If the **Article Validity** field is blank, the date in the **Valid to** field date is set to  January 1, 2100.
