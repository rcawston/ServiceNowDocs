# Configure solution definitions to find gaps in a knowledge base

The Knowledge Demand Insights feature finds knowledge gaps by comparing knowledge bases with existing tasks. To enable comparing knowledge bases with a task type, you must first configure similarity and clustering solution definitions.

## Before you begin

This task describes the process for configuring a solution definition.

Instead of doing the configuration through this procedure, consider using a guided setup. Navigate to **Knowledge** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Guided Setup**, click **Get Started**, and then scroll to the Knowledge Demand Insights section.

Role required: admin

## About this task

Configure one similarity type and one clustering type solution definitions for each task type: incidents, customer service cases, or other tasks. A similarity solution definition collects and compares your existing records to new similar records. A clustering solution definition groups similar records into clusters so you can address them collectively or identify patterns.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Knowledge Demand Insights** &gt; **Solution Definitions**.

2.  In the Solution Definitions \(ML view\) list, search for and select the similarity solution definition for the task type.

    -   For customer service cases, select **Demand Insights: Similar Cases and Knowledge \(ml\_sn\_global\_similar\_cases\_and\_kbs\)**.
    -   For incidents, select **Demand Insights: Similar Incidents and Knowledge \(ml\_sn\_global\_similar\_incidents\_and\_kbs\)**.
    -   For HR cases, select **Demand Insights: Similar HR Cases and Knowledge \(ml\_x\_sn\_hr\_core\_global\_demand\_insights\_similar\_hr\_cases\_and\_knowledge\)**.
    -   For tasks other than customer service cases, incidents, and HR cases, click **New** to create another similarity solution definition.
3.  On the Similarity Definition form, verify the default field values for customer service cases or incidents, or fill in the values for a custom configuration.

    **Note:** If the application scope isn't set to Knowledge Management - Machine Learning, you cannot edit the form and a warning message appears. To make the form editable, click the word **here** at the end of the message.

Processing Language

</td><td id="processing">

Dominant language of the dataset you're training on the solution definition. By default, English processing is applied to all datasets. For example, if you select Italian, the system processes the data in both English and Italian.**Note:** The term processing indicates some of the language-specific steps used as part of training a solution. These steps might include tokenizing words, removing stop words, and stemming.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Stopwords

</td><td id="stopwords">

Common terms in the processing language that are excluded from the search, for example, prepositions.When you select your processing language, the system automatically adds a Stopwords list that uses the same language. For example, if your processing language is Italian, the **Default Italian Stopwords** list appears. The **Default English Stopwords** list also appears in your selection as well.

</table>4.  Submit and train the solution definition.

    -   For a new solution definition record, click **Submit &amp; Train**.
    -   For an existing solution definition record, click **Update &amp; Retrain**.
5.  Include more useful related articles by reviewing the similarity examples based on the similarity score and updating the similarity score threshold value.

    For more information, see [Review solution similarity examples](../../intelligent-experiences/predictive-intelligence/review-similarity-examples.md) and [Update your similarity score threshold](../../intelligent-experiences/predictive-intelligence/update-similarity-threshold.md).

6.  In the Solution Definitions \(ML view\) list, search for and select the clustering solution definition for the task type.

    -   For customer service cases, select **Demand Insights: Case Clusters Need Knowledge \(ml\_sn\_global\_cases\_need\_knowledge\_cluster\)**.
    -   For incidents, select **Demand Insights: Incident Clusters Need Knowledge \(ml\_sn\_global\_incidents\_need\_knowledge\_cluster\)**.
    -   For HR cases, select **Demand Insights: HR case clusters need knowledge \(ml\_x\_sn\_hr\_core\_global\_demand\_insights\_hr\_case\_clusters\_need\_knowledge\)**.
    -   For tasks other than customer service cases and incidents, click **New** to create another clustering solution definition.
7.  On the Clustering Definition form, verify the default field values for customer service cases or incidents, or fill in the values for a custom configuration.

    **Note:** If the application scope isn't set to Knowledge Management - Machine Learning, you cannot edit the form and a warning message appears. To make the form editable, click the word **here** at the end of the message.
