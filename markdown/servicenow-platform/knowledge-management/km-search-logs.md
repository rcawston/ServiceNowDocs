# Search Log fields and description

The knowledge search log stores the history of all knowledge searches performed by the users.

The Search log stores information from all the available sources where users can access knowledge articles. It displays data from the Knowledge Searches \[ts\_query\_kb\] table.

**Note:** The Knowledge Search log captures data only from Zing searches. It does not work with AI searches.

As an administrator and knowledge manager, you can access the search log by navigating to **All** &gt; **Knowledge** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Search Log**.

The following table describes some of the fields in the Search log.
