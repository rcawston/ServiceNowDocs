# Enable external or public users to view knowledge articles from the Knowledge Management Service Portal

Enable knowledge articles on the Knowledge Management Service Portal to be visible to external or public users.

## Before you begin

The Knowledge Management Service Portal plugin \(com.snc.knowledge\_serviceportal\) must be enabled.

Role required: admin

## About this task

If you're using Knowledge Management within the Customer Service Management \(CSM\) application, you can automatically make knowledge articles public by activating and running the Make KM Service Portal Pages Public fix script after you install the Customer Service Management plugin \(com.sn\_customerservice\).

If you're using Knowledge Management as a standalone application, perform the steps in this procedure.

## Procedure

2.  In the Pages list, search for and open **kb\_home**.

    **Note:** If the application scope isn't set to Knowledge Management - Service Portal, you cannot edit the form and a warning message appears. To make the form editable, select the word **here** at the end of the message.

3.  Enable public or external users to view knowledge articles from the Knowledge Management Service Portal.
