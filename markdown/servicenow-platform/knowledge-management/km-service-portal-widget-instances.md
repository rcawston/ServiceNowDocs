# Knowledge Management Service Portal widgets

The Knowledge Management Service Portal uses a number of widgets to enable searches, display search results, and display articles, related articles, and related items.

In the Knowledge Management Service Portal, the Knowledge Management homepage, search results page, and article view page honor the Knowledge Management V3 system properties. If configured, widget instance options can override the system properties.

**Note:**

Starting with the Washington DC release, the Knowledge Management v3 homepage \(com.snc.knowledge3\) is being prepared for deprecation in the future Y release. It is replaced by the Knowledge Management Service Portal \(com.snc.knowledge\_serviceportal\), which is active by default for customers on Madrid and later releases. For more information about the new experience, see [Knowledge Management Service Portal homepage features](knowledge-service-portal-pages.md).

Users with the knowledge\_admin or admin role can configure the widget instance options used on the Knowledge Management Service Portal pages. Use the control + right-click menu to access the widget instance options and configure a widget instance. For more information, see [Configure widget instance options](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/service-portal/c_ConfigureWidgetInstances.md).

**Note:** Before configuring widget instance options, switch to the Knowledge Management - Service Portal scope.
