# Workflow fields with deleted records

Workflow fields may indicate when a record required by the workflow is deleted.

After a referenced record is deleted, the reference in the primary record is no longer valid. If the stage renderer detects a reference that is no longer valid, the stage field displays a message about the deleted record.

Administrators can restore deleted records. For more information, see [Use the Deleted Records module to restore a deleted record](../../platform-administration/table-administration-and-data-management/t_RestoreADeletedRecordAndRef.md).
