# Create a workflow for a new service catalog item

When you create a new service catalog item, you can create a new corresponding workflow at the same time.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Catalog** &gt; **Catalog Definitions** &gt; **Maintain Items**.

2.  At the top of the form, next to **Catalog Items**, click **New** ![](../image/NewCatalogItemButton.png).

    The Catalog Item form opens.

3.  Add a **Name**.

4.  Select the **Process Engine** tab.

5.  Next to the **Workflow** field, click the lookup icon .

6.  Next to Workflow at the top, click **New**.

    ![Create a workflow from a Service Catalog item.](../../workflow/image/CreateWorkflowFromServiceCatalog.png) The Workflow version dialog opens in the New Workflow View. The **Table** field is set to **Requested Item \(sc\_req\_item\)** and is read-only.

7.  Add a **Name**.

8.  \[Optional\]Add a **Description**.

9.  \[Optional\] Change the stage information as necessary.

11. Finish creating the workflow by adding activities, validating, and publishing so the workflow is available to other users.

13. Click **Update**.

    If you close the Workflow Editor, you can see the Catalog Item record. Note that the workflow is added to the Workflow field. The Show Workflow and Information icons appear next to the **Workflow** field. Hover over the information icon to view a read-only summary of the workflow.
