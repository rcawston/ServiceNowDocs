## Troubleshooting

Use the following procedure to troubleshoot this validator:

1.  Open and check out a workflow.
2.  Open the list of stages for the workflow by selecting the menu icon and selecting **Edit Stages**.
3.  Check the names and values.

    Ensure that the names and values are unique and are not empty.

4.  If the same stage name or value apprears more than once, remove one of the rows. It is then very important to go through the workflow and reassign stages in the activities that used the removed stage.

Tip: Make a list of which activities assign which stages.
