    -   **Completed**: Displays quiz instances that are complete. By default, these instances are sorted in descending order by the **Taken on** field.
    -   **Cancelled**: Displays quiz instances that are canceled. By default, these instances are sorted in ascending order by the **Number** field.
    -   **All**: Displays quiz instances in all states. By default, these instances are sorted in ascending order by the **Number** field.
