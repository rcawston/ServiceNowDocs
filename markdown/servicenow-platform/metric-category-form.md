Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

Name of the metric category. The name appears on assessment questionnaires.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Type

</td><td>

\[Required\] Metric type this category is used for. Metrics in this category can be used to evaluate assessable records for the type you select. This field becomes read-only after you save the record.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Create stakeholders

</td><td>

Check box that enables \(selected\) or disables \(cleared\) automatic [stakeholder](r_CategoryUsersAndStakeholders.md) creation for this category. When the check box is selected, the system makes all associated category users stakeholders for each assessable record associated to this category. This saves the time required to manually create stakeholders. For more information, see Create Stakeholders Automatically. Existing stakeholders are not impacted if you clear the check box.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Table

</td><td>

\[Read-Only\] Table that contains the records to evaluate with metrics in this category. The system automatically populates this field with the same table as the metric type selected. The table does not appear in the field until you save the form.

 This field is visible depending on whether a **Type** is selected.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Weight

</td><td>

\[Required\] Numerical value that represents the importance of this category relative to other categories. A greater value indicates greater importance. For more information, see [weight categories and metrics](c_AssessmentMetrics.md). The default value is 10.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Scoring type

</td><td>

Scoring method for an attestation category. This field appears only when the [metric type](c_MetricTypesAndAssessableRecords.md) is an attestation with a **Scoring type** of **Percent**. Use this field to configure different scoring types for specific attestation categories. Possible selections are: -   **Percent**: Attestation score as a weighted percentage of correct answers for scored questions.
-   **All or nothing**: All answers for attestation type questions must be correct or the score is zero for the entire category.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Total metrics

</td><td>

\[Read-Only\] Number of metrics associated to this category.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Filter

</td><td>

Filter conditions that assessable records must meet to be evaluated using metrics in this category.

 The filter operates on fields on the selected table.

 If you specify a filter condition, the system automatically associates matching assessable records to the category when you save the record. If you change the filter conditions, the system removes and creates assessable record associations as needed. The system also deletes stakeholders for assessable records it disassociates. The system does not remove assessable record associations created by users, even if the assessable records do not match the filter conditions.

 This field is visible only when a **Type** is selected.

</td></tr><tr><td>
