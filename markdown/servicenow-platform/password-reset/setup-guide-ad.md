## Password Reset Windows Application

The Password Reset Windows Application enables a user, who forgets the password or is locked out of a Windows computer, to reset the password directly from the Windows login screen.

### How the Password Reset Windows Application works

Download the Password Windows Reset application from the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) and run an EXE or MSI file to install or distribute the application to user computers. The application installs a link on the Windows login screen. The user clicks the link \(**Forgot Password?** as depicted in the examples on various Windows versions\) and is then guided through the process of resetting the password.

![Windows login screen](../image/password-reset-login-win7.png "Windows login screen")

By default, when a user requests a reset, the instance sends the user a URL with a user-specific token. After the user opens the URL, the instance prompts the user to enter and confirm the new password. The instance does not send a temporary password.

### Restrictions on the Password Reset Windows Application

-   The Password Reset Windows Application does not support custom verifications.
-   The Password Reset Windows Application uses the base-system CAPTCHA service even if the Password Reset application is configured to use Google reCAPTCHA with the web interface. See the section titled "Settings on the Details tab" in [Configure your Password Reset process](t_CreateAPasswordResetProcess.md). .
-   The Password strength indicator is not supported. See [Configure the connection to a credential store for the Password Reset processes](t_CreateACredentialStore.md).
-   For some verification types, you can use only one verification. Custom verifications are not supported. See [Password Reset verifications](c_PWRVerifications.md) for details.
-   Custom UI macros configured on the **Process** &gt; **Advanced** page are not supported \(for example, entry, success, or failure macros\). The system displays only the default success and failure messages.
-   The Password Reset Windows Application supports newline characters in the **Password rule hint** text. Other formatting is not supported \(bold, underline, hyperlink, and so on\). See [Configure the connection to a credential store for the Password Reset processes](t_CreateACredentialStore.md).
