# Configure your Password Reset process to auto-enroll users

To simplify management, many organizations auto-enroll users in the Password Reset program. Every base-system verification type enables you to specify automatic enrollment for your process.

## Before you begin

Role required: password\_reset\_admin

## About this task

To enable automatic enrollment, you configure settings for the verification type that your Password Reset process is based on.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Password Reset** &gt; **Extensions** &gt; **Verification Types**.

2.  Click the verification type for the verification that your Password Reset process uses.

    The verification type for each base-system verification is identified in [Password Reset verifications](c_PWRVerifications.md).

3.  On the **Verification Types** page, specify the following settings:

<table id="table_p5w_mgz_h1b"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Enrollment check

</td><td>

Script that determines whether a user is enrolled for verification. **Note:** For automatic enrollment to work, the **Enrollment check** script must return true. This may require additional setup by the admin to ensure that the preconditions are met. For example, for the **SMS Code** verification type, records must be populated in particular tables.

 If no script is specified when **Automatic Enrollment** is selected, a default script is provided.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Automatic enrollment

</td><td>

Select the check box to auto-enroll users. **Note:** If **Automatic enrollment** is not selected, then you must provide an enrollment UI macro and enrollment processor script as described in [Create a custom Password Reset verification type](create-verification-type.md).

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>4.  Repeat the procedure for all verifications that your Password Reset process uses.
