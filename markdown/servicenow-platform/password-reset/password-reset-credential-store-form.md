# Password Reset Credential Store form

Description of the fields on the Password Reset Credential Store form.

<table id="table_e3x_kff_g1b"><tbody><tr><td>

Type

</td><td>

Type of credential store that you are connecting to. A ServiceNow credential store type is a template that provides the required set of capabilities for a particular kind of credential store. Credential stores inherit the functionality of the credential store type.**Note:** For an AD credential store, skip this procedure and see [Integrate Password Reset with your Active Directory service](t_ConPassResetActiveDir.md). The Password Reset Windows Application supports only AD credential stores.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Auto generate password

</td><td>

Script include that generates a temporary password for use during the reset process.If you select the **Enforce history policy** check box, then you must specify a value for **Auto-generate password** that is compliant with the password policy.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Enforce history policy

</td><td>

Appears only if you select a credential store **Type** of **AD Credential Store** or **Local ServiceNow Instance**. For information on configuring the setting for an AD credential store, see [Configure the connection to an AD credential store](config-ad-credential-store.md). Select the **Enforce history policy** check box to ensure that users do not reuse passwords. For example, you might configure the history policy to not allow the user to reuse any of the previous 10 passwords. Follow this procedure:

 1.  Select the **Enforce history policy** check box.
2.  In the Password Reset Credential Store Parameters related list, create a **password\_history\_limit** parameter.
3.  Set the value of the parameter to the number of previous passwords that cannot be used \(maximum **10**\). The default value of 0 \(zero\) enables use of any previous password.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Child Alias

</td><td>

Child aliases are associated with the base alias. After creating a connection and credential alias, you can create a child alias to configure multiple connections for a password reset credential store. When a password reset request is made, the flow checks whether there are child alias connections at the process level. If the child alias is configured at the credential store level, the flow picks the aliases connections and proceeds with the request.
