# Configure the required strength for passwords

The password that a user defines must meet certain requirements — for example, it must contain at least 12 characters, it must include a numeral, and so on. You can configure the requirements as needed for your organization.

## Before you begin

Role required: password\_reset\_admin

## About this task

The base system includes example credential stores with various password requirements. You can modify password requirements and provide users with hints for creating a password. The default requirements are:

-   At least eight characters
-   At least one uppercase and one lower case letter
-   At least one numeral

**Note:** In addition to configuring password strength requirements, you can configure several other settings for the credential store, as described in [Configure the connection to a credential store for the Password Reset processes](t_CreateACredentialStore.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Password Reset** &gt; **Credential Stores**.

2.  Select the credential store in the list and then configure the following settings:

<table><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Password rule hint

</td><td>

Specify the text that appears on the password reset page to help the user to create a password that meets all requirements. The **Password rule** script enforces the requirements.**Note:** The Password Reset Windows Application supports newline characters in the hint. Other formatting is not supported \(bold, underline, hyperlink, and so on\).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Password rule

</td><td>

Specify the client script that validates the new password that the user enters. The script is invoked when the user enters a new password and clicks **Password Reset**. You can use the script to enforce password strength/complexity requirements.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Enable Password Strength

</td><td>

Select the check box to:-   Display the text box for the **Strength rule** script so you can update the script.
-   Display the graphical **Password Strength** bar to the user while the user changes or resets the password.
 **Note:** The Password Reset Windows Application does not support Password Strength.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Strength rule

</td><td>

This text box appears only if you select **Enable Password Strength**.Specify the client script that calculates the strength/complexity of the password that the user enters. The script is invoked when the user begins to enter a new password during the reset process.

Default settings:-   Selected for local ServiceNow credential stores
-   Not selected for other credential stores
 **Note:**

-   To guide the user during the reset process, the system displays a graphical bar labeled **Password Strength** under the **New password** field.

</table>3.  Click **Submit**.

    You should test the connection to a credential store after you configure a new credential store or when users experience problems that might involve the connection.

4.  Navigate to **Password Reset** &gt; **Credential Stores** and then open the credential store.

5.  In the header bar, click **Save and Test Connection**.

    A progress page displays the result of the test.
