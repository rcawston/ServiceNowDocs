# Use an EXE file from the command line

As an alternative to command-line installation, you can use a wizard.

## Before you begin

Role required: security\_admin elevated privilege

Privilege required: Windows local administrator

## Procedure

1.  Ensure that the user with the ServiceNow security\_admin role configures the security properties.

    For more information about the security properties, see [Configure security settings for the Password Reset Windows Application](win-security-properties-password-reset.md)

2.  Copy the following command into a text editor as one line with no breaks.

    ```
    PasswordResetWinAppInstall.exe /VERYSILENT /PasswordResetLinkURL https://<YourServerName>/$pwd_reset.do?sysparm_url=default /PasswordResetLinkName "Forgot password?"
    ```

3.  Add arguments and replace the default parameter values with the correct values for your organization.

    |Argument|Example|Description|
    |--------|-------|-----------|
    |`/Log`|`/Log=c:\temp\PwdResetInstallLog.log`|Optional. To generate a log file, you must first create the directory that the file is written to. In this example, you would create the `c:\temp`directory before running the installation.|
    |`/NORESTART`|`/NORESTART`|Optional. Include `/NORESTART` to prompt the user to restart the computer after installation.|
