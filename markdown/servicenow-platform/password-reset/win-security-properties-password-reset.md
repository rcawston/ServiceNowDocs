# Configure security settings for the Password Reset Windows Application

Configuring security settings for the Password Reset Windows Application.

## Security settings

-   The **glide.security.use\_csrf\_token** property setting allows the Password Reset Windows Application to retrieve a token for a secure communication with the datacenter instance.
-   The **CheckCertificateRevocationList** registry key default setting of **true** causes the Password Reset Windows Application to validate the server certificate before every communication. See [Customize the Password Reset Windows Application](win-customize-password-reset.md) for details.

## Configure the glide.security.use\_csrf\_token property

To configure the **glide.security.use\_csrf\_token** property, a security\_admin elevated privilege is required.

Set the **glide.security.use\_csrf\_token** property to true \(Yes\). See the topic titled "High Security Settings" in [https://servicenow.com/docs](https://servicenow.com/docs).

The Windows local administrator performs the remainder of the installation procedure.
