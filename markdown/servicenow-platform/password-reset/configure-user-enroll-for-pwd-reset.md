# Enable users to enroll for Password Reset

To enable users to enroll for the Password Reset program, you specify a UI macro that takes the user through the enrollment process and a script that processes the enrollment data that the user entered. The base system includes a functioning macro and script.

## Before you begin

Role required: password\_reset\_admin

## About this task

To enable users to enroll, you configure settings for the verification type that your Password Reset process is based on.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Password Reset** &gt; **Extensions** &gt; **Verification Types**.

2.  Click the verification type for the verification that your Password Reset process uses.

    The verification type for each base-system verification is identified in [Password Reset verifications](c_PWRVerifications.md).

3.  On the **Verification Types** page, specify the following settings:

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Automatic enrollment|Clear the check box to disable automatic enrollment.|
    |Enrollment UI|Enrollment UI macro that takes the user through the enrollment process.|
    |Enrollment processor|Enrollment processor script that processes enrollment data.|

4.  Repeat the procedure for all verifications that your Password Reset process uses.


## Enabling user enrollment

This example verification type uses the pwd\_enroll\_sms\_ui enrollment UI macro and the PwdEnrollSMSProcessor enrollment processor script.

A verification type must also define a verification UI macro and a corresponding verification processor script. The example uses the pwd\_verify\_sms\_uiverification UI macro and the PwdVerifySMSProcessor verification processor script.
