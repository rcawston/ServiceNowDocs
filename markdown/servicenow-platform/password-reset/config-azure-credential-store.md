2.  Enter a unique **Name** and **Description** and then complete the form.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Hostname

</td><td>

Specify the domain name of the Entra ID application in this column.

 **Note:**

To guide the user during the reset process, the system displays a graphical bar labeled **Password Strength** under the **New password** field.

</td></tr><tr><td>

</td><td>

Check this option to select either a default password policy or one you created yourself previously.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>3.  Click **Submit**.

    Password Reset Credential store record to access your Microsoft Entra ID server is configured.

    **Note:**

    -   The **Enable Password Policy** option was added in the Quebec release. Checking the option displays your password policy choices right from your instance. To learn more, see [Enable password policies on your instance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/authentication/enable-password-policies.md).
    -   Since the Microsoft Entra ID doesn't support the history policy, the **Enforce history policy** option is hidden.
