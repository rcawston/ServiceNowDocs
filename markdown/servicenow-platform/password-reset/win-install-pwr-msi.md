# Use an MSI file from the command line

Use the MSI file to install the Password Reset Windows Application on multiple computers over a network. As an alternative to MSI installation, you can also install from the command line.

## Before you begin

Role required: Windows local administrator

    For more information about security properties, see [Configure security settings for the Password Reset Windows Application](win-security-properties-password-reset.md).

2.  Copy the following command into a text editor as one line with no breaks.

    ```
    msiexec.exe /i PasswordResetWinAppInstall.msi /quiet WRAPPED_ARGUMENTS="/SUPPRESSMSGBOXES /VERYSILENT /NORESTART /PasswordResetLinkURL https://<YourServerName>/$pwd_reset.do?sysparm_url=default /PasswordResetLinkName ""Forgot password?"""
    ```

3.  Add arguments and replace the default parameter values with the correct values for your organization.
