# Limitations of the Password Reset Windows Application

The Password Reset Windows Application has a few limitations.

-   The Password Reset Windows Application doesn't support custom verifications.
-   The Password Reset Windows Application uses the base-system CAPTCHA service even if the Password Reset application is configured to use Google reCAPTCHA with the web interface.
-   The Password strength indicator is not supported.
-   For some verification types, you can use only one verification. Custom verifications are not supported. For more information, see [Password Reset verifications](c_PWRVerifications.md).
-   Custom UI macros configured on the **Process** &gt; **Advanced** page are not supported \(for example, entry, success, or failure macros\). The system displays only the default success and failure messages.
-   The Password Reset Windows Application supports newline characters in the **Password rule hint** text. Other formatting is not supported \(bold, underline, and hyperlink\). For more information, see [Configure the connection to a credential store for the Password Reset processes](t_CreateACredentialStore.md).
