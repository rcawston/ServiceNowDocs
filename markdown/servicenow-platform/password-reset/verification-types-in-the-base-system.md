Email Code

</td><td>

When a user requests password reset, the system sends a verification code to the email address in the user profile or to an email address that the user authorized during enrollment. To verify identity, the user then submits the code on the Password Reset **Verify** page. **Note:** The Password Reset Windows Application allows you to define and use multiple verifications of the Email Code type.

Google Authenticator

</td><td>

While requesting password reset, the user reads a code from the Google Authenticator app on a device that the user has paired.
