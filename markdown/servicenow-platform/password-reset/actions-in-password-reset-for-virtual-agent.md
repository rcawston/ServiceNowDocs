## Enrollment in Password Reset for Virtual Agent

You can let end users enroll for Password Reset verifications using the Virtual Agent. The Virtual Agent includes an enrollment topic and its topic blocks for each verification, such as SMS, email, security question, Soft PIN, or a third-party authenticator app. Users can select any of the topic blocks to enroll for verification.

You can modify the enrollment topic, but you must duplicate the default enrollment topic and then modify the duplicated topic.

Here's the enrollment flow in Virtual Agent:

1.  Users select the enrollment topic in Virtual Agent.
2.  Users select any one of these verification types:
    -   **Security questions**
        -   If users aren't enrolled, Virtual Agent displays the questions, and users need to select questions and give answers to them.
        -   If users are already enrolled, Virtual Agent shows options to the users to:
            -   Change answers to the existing questions
            -   Re-enroll
    -   **Soft PIN**
        -   If the user isn't enrolled, Virtual Agent displays rules that are followed by a Soft PIN question. Users enter a valid Soft PIN and complete the enrollment.
        -   If users are already enrolled, they get a message asking whether to update existing Soft PIN enrollment.

            If users select **Yes**, Virtual Agent displays rules that are followed by a Soft PIN question.

            Users must enter a valid Soft PIN to complete the enrollment.

            **Note:** When users change the existing Soft PIN, they must use a new Soft PIN that must differ from the previously existing Soft PIN.

    -   **Third-party authenticator app**

        -   If users aren't enrolled, they get a QR code and an alphanumeric code. Users can scan the QR code or enter the alphanumeric code in the authenticator app.
        -   If users are already enrolled, they get two options:

            -   Generate a new QR code and an alphanumeric code
            -   Disable multi-factor authentication
            If users select an option to generate a new QR, the new enrollment flow starts. If users select the other option, the multi-factor authentication gets disabled. If the multi-factor authentication is disabled, to re-enroll, users must enable it again.

        Password Reset supports the following third-party authenticator apps:

        -   Google Authenticator
        -   Microsoft Authenticator
        -   Cisco Duo
    -   **Email and SMS**
        -   If users aren’t enrolled, they can add new mobile devices for SMS verification or can add an email address for email verification.
        -   If users are already enrolled, they can view the list of enrolled mobile devices for SMS verification, or they can view an email address. For SMS, the users can verify, remove, or authorize mobile devices. For email, the users can verify or authorize the email address.
