 This table is used for the reporting purpose.

 The Sync Password Reset Enrollment Snapshot Data Monthly scheduled job runs once a month to generate or sync snapshot data in this table. The data, such as sys\_user creation or deletion, verification to process creation or deletion, and so on, is synchronized.

 Password Reset DB listener is used to create or update the data in this table which is managed by the **pwd\_reset.enable.dbListener** property with default value as true.

 If you’re an admin and want to manually sync the data in this table related to an active process, select **Sync Enrollment Snapshot Data** on that Password Reset process.

 You can turn off the data synchronization in this table through the DB listener or the monthly scheduled job by setting the **pwd\_reset.enable.enrollment\_snapshot** property to false.

 **Note:** Initially, an inactive record is created by the DB listener for a user-verification pair. When the users enrol themselves on the Password Reset Enrolment page, the record becomes active in this table.

## UI scripts installed with Password Reset

You can create a UI script and reference the script from a UI macro or UI page by using a &lt;g:include\_script&gt; Jelly tag. The following example shows how the $pwd\_enroll\_questions\_ui UI macro can reference the $pwd\_enroll\_questions\_ui script. In the example, \[UI Script Name\]+".jsdbx" is the name of the script:

```
<g:include_script src="$pwd_enroll_questions_ui.jsdbx" />
```

By referencing an external script, you can maintain separation between client JavaScript code and Jelly code, which simplifies maintenance. You can use the following installed scripts with Password Reset UI macros:

|Name|Description|

|$pwd\_csrf\_common\_ui\_script|Common UI script for handling a Cross-site Request Forgery \(CSRF\).|
