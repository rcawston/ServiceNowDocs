# Credentials Store for Password Reset for Active Directory

A credential store type is a set of workflows that specify how to connect to a credential store. You can connect to **Password Reset** **Credential Stores** to view the list of example credential stores that are based on the base-system types.

## Overview

Navigate to **Password Reset** &gt; **Credential Stores** to view the list of example credential stores that are based on the base-system types. You can also use subflows and integration hub [IntegrationHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/integrationhub.md).

-   **[Integrate Password Reset with your Active Directory service](t_ConPassResetActiveDir.md)**  
The Password Reset application can change passwords on an Active Directory credential store. The application changes passwords by referencing an Active Directory user role with the appropriate password change privileges.
-   **[Configure the connection to an AD credential store](config-ad-credential-store.md)**  
You can create a Password Reset credential store record to configure access to your Active Directory server while a user is changing or resetting a password. In addition to host connection information, you can specify the password hints that users should see, restrictions on password reuse, the allowed number of failed reset attempts, and other settings.
