# Integrate Password Reset with your Active Directory service

The Password Reset application can change passwords on an Active Directory credential store. The application changes passwords by referencing an Active Directory user role with the appropriate password change privileges.

## Before you begin

Active Directory must have a user role with the following privileges:

Descendent User objects:

-   Reset password
-   Read/Write pwdlastset
-   Read/Write UserAccountcontrol
-   Write Account Restrictions
-   Read/Write lockouttime
-   Read MemberOf

Descendent Group objects:

-   Read Members
-   Read MemberOf

Role required: password\_reset\_admin

## Procedure

1.  [Install a MID Server](../mid-server/mid-server-installation.md) on a Windows computer that can connect to Active Directory.

2.  [Configure the MID Server](../mid-server/c_MIDServerConfiguration.md).

3.  If using the Workflow and Orchestration add-ons, in the ServiceNow instance, navigate to **Orchestration** &gt; **Credentials**.

4.  Click **New**, complete the form with the following values for the AD credential, and then click **Submit**.

    |Field|Description|
