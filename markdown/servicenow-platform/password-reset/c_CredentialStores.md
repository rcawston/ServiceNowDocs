# Credential stores for Password Reset

Credential stores hold user information such as user names and passwords that can be used as login credentials. Examples include the User table \[sys\_user\] or an Active Directory server.

Users with the password\_reset\_admin or password\_reset\_credential\_manager role can create and modify connections to credential stores.

## Credential store types installed with the base system

A credential store type is a set of workflows that specify how to connect to a credential store. Navigate to **Password Reset** &gt; **Credential Store Types** to view the list of example credential stores that are based on the base-system types. The base system includes the following credential store types:

|Name|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Local ServiceNow Instance|Represents the current \(local\) ServiceNow instance.|

</table>## Connection subflows for credential store types

A credential store type workflow requires a subflow that defines how to connect to the store, and can include an optional subflow that defines how to test the connection. Use the **Pwd reset – AD** and **Pwd Reset - Local** subflows as models for your custom connection workflows.

## Creating a custom credential store type

You can use a credential store type as a model to create a custom type. See [Create a credential store type for Password Reset](t_CreateACredentialStoreType.md).

-   **[Configure the connection to a credential store for the Password Reset processes](t_CreateACredentialStore.md)**  
You create a Password Reset credential store record to configure access to your credential store server while a user is changing or resetting a password. In addition to host connection information, you can specify the password hints that users should see, restrictions on password reuse, the allowed number of failed reset attempts, and other settings.
-   **[Credentials Store for Password Reset for Active Directory](credentials-store-AD.md)**

-   **[Test the connection to a credential store](test-cxn-to-credential-store.md)**  
You should test the connection to a credential store after you configure a new credential store or when users experience problems that might involve the connection.
-   **[Delete a connection to a credential store for Password Reset](t_DeleteACredentialStore.md)**
