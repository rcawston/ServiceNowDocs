# Use a wizard

As an alternative to wizard installation, you can run commands directly at the command line.

## Before you begin

Role required: Windows local administrator

## Procedure

1.  Ensure that the user with the ServiceNow security\_admin role configures the security properties.

    For more information about the security properties, see [Configure security settings for the Password Reset Windows Application](win-security-properties-password-reset.md).

2.  Right-click the `PasswordResetWinAppInstall.exe` installation file that you downloaded and select **Run as administrator**.

3.  On the **Configure Password Reset Web page and credential provider** page, configure the following settings and then click **Next**:

<table id="table_iwg_3pz_wbb"><thead><tr><th>

URL of the Password Reset page

</td><td>

URL of the page on your ServiceNow instance that users access when resetting a password. Be sure to substitute your ServiceNow server name and the URL suffix for the desired Password Reset process.

</td><td>

`https://<YourServerName>/$pwd_reset.do?sysparm_url=default`

    |Select Destination Location|Accept the default installation location.|
    |Select Start Menu Folder|Accept the default "ServiceNow".|
