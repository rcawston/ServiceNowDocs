# Integrating ServiceNow Voice for HR

The ServiceNow Voice for HR Agent Workspace provides seamless interactive voice response \(IVR\) and calling experiences for your employees and agents by integrating a cloud contact center provider with the robust capabilities of the Agent Workspace for HR Case Management.

The ServiceNow Voice for HR provides the following capabilities:

-   An inbound contact flow to define the employee experience in an IVR.
-   An outbound contact flow to connect with employee contacts from the phone number field displayed in any of the ServiceNow application interfaces.
-   Operation handlers to configure automated interactions for employee service cases.

## Employee experience with ServiceNow Voice for HR

The following example provides an overview of how an employee uses ServiceNow Voice for HR to resolve their HR requests and issues.

An employee calls the general HR phone number with a request. The employee provides information via the interactive voice response \(IVR\). Using the provided information, ServiceNow Voice for HR tries to identify the caller.

If the caller is identified as an existing employee in HR Agent Workspace, Voice reads a personal greeting to the employee and offers automated interactions to enable the employee to independently address their request. If the employee cannot resolve their request using the IVR, the system routes the call to a live agent.

If the caller is not identified, the call is routed to a live agent.

## Agent experience with ServiceNow Voice for HR

Once installed, ServiceNow Voice appears as a pop-up in the HR Agent Workspace where agents can do the following:

-   Indicate availability to receive calls on the agent softphone

-   Preview caller information before accepting an inbound call.

-   View the call transcript, hear the recording, and review the call analysis in the interaction related list.

-   Make outbound calls to connect with a employee and automatically capture interaction details to simplify data entry
