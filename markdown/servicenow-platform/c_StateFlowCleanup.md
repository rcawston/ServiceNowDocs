# State flow cleanup

The business rules, client scripts, and UI actions that the system creates automatically to perform custom transitions exist only while the state flow records that use them are present.

When all the state flows on a table are deleted, the system attempts to delete any unnecessary programming elements that were created on that table, using these criteria:

<table id="table_qvn_t2l_cp"><thead><tr><th>

Element

</th><th>

Deleted When

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

 Dictionary override

The state flow that created it is deleted.
