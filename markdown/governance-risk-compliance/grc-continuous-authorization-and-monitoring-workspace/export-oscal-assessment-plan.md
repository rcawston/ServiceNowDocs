# Export an OSCAL Assessment Plan

Export engagement data as OSCAL Assessment Plan files to share testing plans with auditors or import into external systems.

## Before you begin

-   Authorization package is in the Assess step or later
-   At least one engagement with associated entities exists in the package

Role required: sn\_irm\_cont\_auth.info\_system\_sec\_officer or sn\_irm\_cont\_auth.admin.

## About this task

Exporting an OSCAL Assessment Plan from CAM generates a zip file containing all necessary OSCAL model files. The export includes the Assessment Plan file for each engagement, along with supporting files such as Catalog, Profile, SSP, Overlay, and POAM. Overlay, and POAM are optional. You can use exported files to share testing plans with external auditors or import into other OSCAL-compliant systems.

The export process generates files asynchronously. After generation completes, download buttons appear on the screen.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **CAM Workspace** and then select the **lists icon**.

2.  From the **Authorization packages** in the RMF list, select an authorization package record in Assess step or later.

3.  Navigate to the Controls tab.

4.  On the Controls tab, from the Generate OSCAL dropdown list, select **Generate OSCAL AP**.

    The system starts generating OSCAL files asynchronously. This process takes a few minutes depending on package complexity. The **Download OSCAL AP** button appears when the process is complete.

5.  Select More icon and then select **Download OSCAL AP**.

    A zip file downloads containing all generated OSCAL files: Catalog, Profile, SSP, and one AP file per engagement in the package.

    The downloaded zip file contains OSCAL-compliant JSON files. You can validate these files using the OSCAL CLI validator and import them into other systems or share them with external auditors for assessment planning.
