    2.  To save your changes, select **Save**.

        The General settings are saved.

3.  Set up the assessment questions in the **Questions** tab.

    Questions gather the information needed to calculate RTO and RPO values automatically.

    ![Data change frequency.](../image/bia-asmt-ws-questions-tab-2.png)![Data value.](../image/bia-asmt-ws-questions-tab.png)

    The following steps show examples for Data change frequency and Data value questions.

    1.  Select **Add section** in the **Questions** tab.

    2.  Name the section.

        According to your requirements, you can add a section name such as Data change frequency.

    3.  Add a question and its description.

        The table shows sample questions text for Section 1: Data change frequency.

        |Sample question|Sample answer|

    4.  Select the **Publish** button and verify that the template status changes to Published.

        **Note:** The Create automation option only appears after publishing the template.

4.  Create automation rules in the **Automations** tab.

    Automations define the rules that automatically calculate RTO and RPO based on the question responses.

    ![Conditions.](../image/bia-asmt-ws-automations-tab-2-set-condi.png)

    The following steps show examples with conditions and actions.

    1.  Select **Create automation** in the **Automations** tab.

    2.  Select or create an automation.

        According to your requirements, you can add an automation such as Recovery point objective as shown in the example.

        ![Automations.](../image/bia-asmt-ws-automations-tab.png)

        The table shows sample conditions and actions for Action set 1 and "High" data change frequency. Each automation consists of action sets with If-Then logic.

        ![High frequency.](../image/bia-asmt-ws-automations-tab-2-set-condi-high.png)![Actions for high frequency.](../image/bia-asmt-ws-automations-tab-2-set-actions-high-imme.png)

</table>        Conditions use Response based filtering to check question answers. Multiple conditions can be combined with and/or operators. The "Else" clause provides a fallback action if none of the conditions match. Each action set can have multiple conditions and actions.

    3.  To enable automation, select **Activate** after configuring all action sets and verify that the automation status shows as “Active.”

        **Note:** Automations only run when they’re activated. Deactivated automations don’t set RTO and RPO values.

5.  Verify the Action type subflows in the Workflow Studio.

    Action types are implemented as Flow Designer subflows. Each subflow:

    -   Receives inputs from the automation:
        -   Recovery timeframe - The value to set \(for example, “Immediately”, “24 hours”, “1 week”\)
        -   Impact analysis - The scope-based impact analysis record being assessed
    -   Updates the corresponding field on the impact analysis record:
        -   Recovery point objective field
        -   Recovery time objective field
        -   MTPD field
    You can create custom action types by performing the following steps:

    1.  Creating a Flow Designer subflow.
    2.  Defining required input parameters.
    3.  Adding logic to update impact analysis fields.
    4.  Registering the subflow as an action type.
    5.  Selecting the custom action type in the automation configuration.
    A use case example: A single questionnaire can update RTO, RPO, and MTPD simultaneously, or you can create separate assessments for each metric depending on your organization’s requirements.

    1.  Search for the Set recovery point objective action type subflow in the Workflow Studio.

        ![Subflow.](../image/bia-subflow-set-rpo.png)

    2.  Verify that the Recovery timeframe and Impact analysis are selected as the subflow inputs.

        ![Inputs.](../image/bia-subflow-set-rpo-update.png)

    3.  Review the update action that sets the field value.

        ![Action inputs.](../image/bia-subflow-set-rpo-update-2.png)

6.  Link the assessment templates to the BIA templates.

    1.  Access **BIA templates** in the Business Continuity Workspace.

    2.  Open your BIA template.

        The example shows the BIA RTO/RPO template.

    3.  Configure the template.

        The example shows a BIA template and its parameters.

        ![Example.](../image/bia-templates-example.png)

        -   Name: BIA RTO/RPO
        -   Primary element assessed: Datacenters
        -   Assessment type: Smart assessment
        -   Impact assessment templates: Select “Recovery time objective assessment template”, select “Recovery point objective assessment template."
        ![Templates.](../image/bia-templates-imp-asmt-templates.png)

    4.  Select **Update**.

        Verify that automations are activated in the selected assessment templates. Inactive automations do not calculate RTO/RPO values.

7.  To create a BIA, select **New** in the Business Continuity Workspace.

    For more information, see [Create a business impact analysis](create-bia-in-uib-ws.md).

8.  Complete the BIA configuration and save the BIA.

    -   **Assessment generation**

        When you create a BIA using the configured template, assessment records are automatically created:

        1.  Assessments appear in Assessment Workspace &gt; Lists &gt; Business Impact Analysis &gt; In draft.
        2.  Each assessment contains the questions defined in the template.
    -   **Completion of assessments**

        You can complete assessments by performing the following tasks:

        1.  Open the assessment.
        2.  Answer all required questions \(for example, data change frequency, data value\)
        3.  Submit the assessment.
    -   **Automatic RTO and RPO calculation after submission**

        After submission, the system calculates the RTO and RPO:

        1.  Automation rules evaluate the question responses.
        2.  Matching conditions trigger the corresponding actions.
        3.  RTO and RPO fields are automatically populated on the impact analysis record.
        4.  Values appear in the Business Impact Analysis record.
