# Summarize a privacy case using the GRC case summarization skill

Use the GRC case summarization skill to generate an AI summary of a privacy case. The summary provides a consolidated view of the case life cycle, including breach-related assessment activity.

## Before you begin

Install the Now Assist for Privacy Management application. For more information, see [Install Now Assist for Privacy Management](privacy-install-now-assist.md).

Role required:

-   sn\_privacy\_case.privacy\_case\_analyst: Grants access to privacy case records.
-   sn\_prm\_gen\_ai.user: Grants access to the Now Assist for Privacy Management skills.

    **Note:** Users with the sn\_prm\_gen\_ai.user role automatically have the sn\_grc\_sharegenai.grc\_case\_ai\_user role, which is the minimum role required to use the GRC case summarization skill.


## About this task

**Important:** This skill is turned on by default if you have Now Assist for Privacy Management installed. The skill is automatically available to appropriate role users for the application. For more information, see [Now Assist skills, agents, and agentic workflows on by default](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-skills/now-assist-skills-on-by-default.md).

Privacy cases can involve multiple coordinators, complex activity logs, and breach assessments. The GRC case summarization skill generates a concise AI summary of key case details, so assignees and approvers can quickly understand the context and support efficient decision-making.

The skill collects data from predefined fields and related lists across the privacy case record. This data is assembled into a prompt and sent to the configured large language model \(LLM\) service provider, which then returns a structured summary. You can edit and save the AI‑generated summary to the case record for future reference. All members of the **Assignment group** on a case record can view any summary that has been saved to that record.

**Important:** Be sure to check AI-generated summaries for accuracy.

If the **Summarize** option isn’t visible, an admin has to activate the skill from the Now Assist Admin console. For more information, refer to [Activate the GRC case summarization skill](../grc-common-functions/activate-grc-case-summarization-skill.md).
