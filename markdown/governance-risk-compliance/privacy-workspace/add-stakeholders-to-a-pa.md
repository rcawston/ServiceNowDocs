# Add key stakeholders and send privacy assessments

Add key stakeholders to a processing activity to identify the key members who are responsible for processing the personal data within the processing activity. You can then send the respective privacy assessments to the stakeholders based on their responsibilities. For example, an entity owner is a key stakeholder for a processing activity.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_privacy.analyst

## About this task

A processing activity can have multiple key stakeholders. While you can add or delete as many key stakeholders as you want, by default, the entity owner is one of the key stakeholders. All the stakeholders can respond to privacy assessments and some stakeholders can also edit the processing activity based on their privileges. Only users with the sn\_privacy.assessment\_responder and sn\_privacy.business\_user can be added as stakeholders. You can add key stakeholders only when the processing activity is either in the **Discover** or **Review** states.
