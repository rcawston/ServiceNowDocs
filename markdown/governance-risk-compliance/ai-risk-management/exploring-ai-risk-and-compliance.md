# Exploring AI Risk and Compliance

Learn how you can use the AI Risk and Compliance application to manage your artificial intelligence \(AI\) capabilities ethically, mitigate AI risks, and ensure compliance.

## AI Risk and Compliance overview

The AI risk and compliance team is responsible for identifying and assessing risks associated with AI. This includes evaluating legal, regulatory, and ethical considerations to ensure that the AI capabilities are implemented responsibly. Their role is to establish guidelines and frameworks that enable the organization to adopt AI solutions while maintaining compliance with industry standards and ethical principles. The AI Risk and Compliance application enables the risk and compliance team of an organization to manage their AI capabilities and assets.

## AI Risk and Compliance users

The users listed in the following table represent generic roles. Each of these roles may be identified by different titles and names in various organizations. For specific roles within the AI Risk and Compliance application, refer to [Roles installed with AI Risk and Compliance](roles-installed-with-ai-risk-and-compliance.md).

</table>## AI Risk and Compliance workflow

The following section describes the steps involved when an AI asset is created in the AI Control Tower application and the risks for the assets are assessed in the AI Risk and Compliance application until the asset is deployed and moves to being monitored.

When a new AI system is introduced or enhanced, it undergoes a risk assessment and an AI impact assessment. These assessments yield scores that denote the risk levels for the AI systems. After the approval is obtained from the relevant stakeholders, the development or build phase begins. During development, controls are attested, issues are tracked and managed, and policy exceptions are raised as needed from a risk and compliance perspective. Following development, the AI system is reviewed to ensure:

-   Completion of conformity assessment
-   Review and resolution of open issues and policy exceptions
-   Reassessment of risks

Based on these evaluations, the AI system is either approved or rejected for deployment.

The workflow for an AI asset creation and deployment is the following:

1.  Business users use the Employee Center or the AI Control Tower workspace and submit a new AI use case.
2.  A new inventory record is automatically created in the workspace.
3.  The AI Center of Excellence \(COE\) team reviews the submitted use case.
4.  Relevant assets are added to the inventory to help determine if the use case should proceed to the next stage.
5.  In the AI Risk and Compliance workspace, either an AI impact assessment or an AI conformity assessment is initiated.
6.  The assigned business user completes the assessment in the workspace.
7.  Based on the assessment results, potential risks and necessary controls are identified and mapped.
8.  After the assessment is approved, the AI use case is built by the appropriate teams.
9.  The completed solution undergoes a formal review process.
10. Ongoing monitoring is performed to ensure compliance and performance.
11. After successful review, the solution is deployed to production.

## AI Risk and Compliance benefits

The AI Risk and Compliance application addresses the following challenges faced by any organization that uses AI:

-   Lack of AI strategy: No commonly agreed-upon AI strategy or alignment with corporate goals.
-   No centralized management: No single platform for all stakeholders and for the Chief AI officer to collaborate and manage AI use.
-   No responsible AI guidelines: Absence of guidelines for ethical and responsible AI use.
-   No risk assessment process: No process to evaluate risks for in-house and third-party AI.
-   Scalability and monitoring issues: Challenges in scaling AI deployment, tracking performance, and continuously monitoring for emerging risks like privacy.
