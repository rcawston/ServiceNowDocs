# Assessment templates and risk assessment methodologies

The AI Risk and Compliance application uses assessment templates and risk assessment methodologies \(RAMs\) to evaluate AI assets for risk, regulatory compliance, and ethical alignment.

## Assessment and risk assessment methodologies overview

Assessment templates define the questionnaires and evaluation criteria used during AI assessments. RAMs define the scoring frameworks and classification criteria used during risk assessments.

## Smart assessment engine

SAE is the underlying assessment platform that AI Risk and Compliance \(AIRC\) uses to create, manage, and complete all AI assessments. SAE provides the infrastructure for assessment templates, question design, section-based organization, scoring, and collaborative assessment workflows.

AIRC uses the SAE components installed with the AI Risk and Compliance Content application to support assessment creation, scoring, and automation.

## Assessment workspace

AIRC managers \[sn\_grc\_ai\_gov.ai\_risk\_and\_compliance\_manager\] manage assessment templates through the Assessment Workspace. Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Assessment Workspace** to view, edit, and publish assessment templates. The workspace displays the template name, published state, and associated metadata for each template.

Use the Assessment Workspace to perform the following actions:

-   View all available assessment templates and their published state.
-   Open a template to review or edit its sections, questions, and scoring logic.
-   Publish draft templates to make them available for use in assessments.
-   Create assessment templates to support custom assessment requirements.

**Note:** You must publish a template before you can initiate assessments that use it. For more information, see [Publish the assessment templates](publish-the-assessment-templates.md). For more information on creating and editing assessments using Smart Assessment Engine, see [Create an assessment template](../smart-assessment-engine/sae-asmnt-template-create.md) and [Post-assessment automations](../smart-assessment-engine/impact-automation.md).

## Assessment template structure

Each assessment template defines the following components:

-   **Sections**

    Logical groupings that organize related questions within the assessment. Sections provide structure and navigation during assessment completion.

-   **Questions**

    Individual evaluation criteria that assessors respond to during the assessment. Questions can include multiple choice, free text, rating scales, and other response types.

-   **Scoring logic**

    Rules that calculate scores based on assessment responses. Scoring logic determines how individual responses contribute to overall assessment results.

-   **Risk and control mappings**

    Associations between specific responses and predefined risk statements or control objectives. These mappings drive automatic generation of governance records through Post Assessment Actions.


## Post assessment actions

Post Assessment Actions for Smart Assessments \(sn\_smart\_imp\_auto\) provides the automation framework that generates governance records based on assessment responses. When a user completes an assessment, the system evaluates the responses against configured automation rules and creates applicable risks, controls, and other records.

While predefined risk statements and control objectives are delivered through the content library, the conditions that trigger their application are configurable and must be reviewed and validated by each organization.

This framework is critical to the assessment workflow. Without Post Assessment Actions, assessment responses don’t automatically generate the risk statements and control objectives that drive downstream governance activities.

The sn-reusable-impact-framework \(sn\_impact\_fwk\) application, which is installed with Post Assessment Actions for Smart Assessments, provides the reusable framework components that Post Assessment Actions uses in AI Risk and Compliance.

**Note:** Content provided with the product is intended to support ease of use only. Your organization is responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable laws, regulations, directives, and standards, and for validating that any content used is accurate and up to date. Organizations may replace or adapt the provided content to align with their regulatory, governance, and operational requirements.

## How post assessment actions work in AI risk and compliance

When an AI Asset Owner \[sn\_ai\_asset\_mgmt.ai\_asset\_owner\] responds to questions in a Fundamental Rights Impact Assessment \(FRIA\), Post Assessment Actions can evaluate the responses against configured automation rules. If the rule criteria are satisfied, the following sequence occurs:

1.  The system evaluates the assessment responses against the automation rules configured for the assessment template.
2.  Based on the responses, the system identifies applicable risk statements and control objectives from the content library.
3.  The system associates the identified risk statements and control objectives with the assessment record.
4.  After the AI Risk and Compliance analyst \[sn\_grc\_ai\_gov.ai\_risk\_and\_compliance\_analyst\] marks the assessment as closed complete, the system generates risk and control records and maps them to the AI asset.

Before governance records are finalized, an AI Risk and Compliance analyst reviews the prescribed list of generated risks and control objectives. This review step helps ensure that automatically generated records are accurate, relevant, and appropriate for the specific AI system.

**Note:** Custom assessment templates require separate configuration of automation rules.

## Business configuration

Business configuration enables organizations to tailor assessment automation and risk evaluation behavior to their governance, regulatory, and operational requirements. These configurations are typically performed by AI Risk and Compliance administrators.

-   **Post-assessment actions configuration**

    The AI Risk and Compliance admin \[sn\_grc\_ai\_gov.ai\_risk\_and\_compliance\_admin\] configures post-assessment automation rules that determine how assessment responses trigger the association and classification of governance elements for an AI system. These rules govern how control objectives, risk statements, and system characteristics are automatically applied after an assessment is completed and marked as Closed complete.

    Post-assessment actions support the following action types, which translate assessment responses into governance classifications and associations for AI systems:

    These action types enable organizations to consistently associate governance requirements with AI systems based on how assessment questions are answered, helping ensure traceability between assessment outcomes and risk and compliance artifacts.

    Assessment templates provided as part of the base system include predefined control objectives and risk statements in the content library. However, the mapping logic determines which governance elements are associated with an AI system is defined through post-assessment action configuration.

    **Note:** Content provided with the product is intended to support ease of use only. Your organization is responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable laws, regulations, directives, and standards, and for validating that any content used is accurate and up to date. Organizations may replace or adapt the provided content to align with their regulatory, governance, and operational requirements.

    Configuration is performed in the Assessment Workspace by editing the assessment template and defining automation rules that evaluate assessment responses. Each rule specifies which control objectives or risk statements should be associated when a particular response condition is met.

    After configuration, complete a test assessment and verify that the expected control objectives and risk statements are generated and mapped to the AI system once the assessment is marked as Closed complete.

    For more information on post-assessment automations and configurations, see [Post-assessment automations](../smart-assessment-engine/impact-automation.md) and [Configure post-assessment actions](../smart-assessment-engine/configure-post-assessment-actions.md).

-   **Post-assessment action configuration example**

    The following example illustrates how a post-assessment action can be configured on an assessment template and applied after an assessment is completed.

    In the Assessment Workspace, an AI Risk and Compliance admin reviews a published AI impact assessment template and configures a post-assessment action that evaluates responses to a privacy-related question.

    Condition: The automation rule evaluates the response to the assessment question "Does your AI system use personal data"?

    Response: Yes.

    Action: When the response is Yes, the post-assessment action automatically maps predefined governance elements to the associated AI system.

    Mapped control objectives:

    -   Ensure Data Quality
    -   Collect and Analyze Data
    -   Analyze Field Data
    Mapped risk statements:

    -   Operational Continuity and Downtime
    -   Unintended Consequences
    -   Reputational Damage
    -   Regulatory Non-compliance
    -   Privacy Violations
    -   Overfitting and Underfitting
    -   Model Poisoning
    -   Model Performance Degradation \(Model Drift\)
    -   Lack of Transparency and Accountability
    -   Lack of Transparency and Explainability
    -   Inadequate Data Protection
    -   Failure to Address Ethical Standards
    -   Data Security
    -   Data Bias
    -   Data Integrity
    -   Algorithmic Bias and Discrimination
    -   Data Breaches and Theft
    -   Adversarial Attacks
    -   Unauthorized Access to AI Models
    ![Risk statement mapping automation rule example](../image/automation-rule-ex.png "Automation rule view for an impact assessment")

    When the assessment is submitted and marked as Closed complete, these mappings are evaluated and the corresponding risk and control records are automatically associated with the AI system.

    **Note:** Content provided with the product is intended to support ease of use only. Your organization is responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable laws, regulations, directives, and standards, and for validating that any content used is accurate and up to date. Organizations may replace or adapt the provided content to align with their regulatory, governance, and operational requirements.

-   **Risk assessment methodology configuration**

    Administrators can configure which risk assessment methodologies \(RAMs\) are applied during intake, assessment, and risk evaluation workflows.

    Configuration options include specifying default RAMs for AI systems, models, and datasets, as well as enabling automated or advanced risk calculation behavior.

    To configure the default RAM for AI system risk classification at intake, set the `sn_grc_ai_gov.ai_system_risk_classification_ram` property.

    To configure automated risk classification during intake, specify the `sn_grc_ai_gov.ai_system_automated_risk_classification_asmt_ram` property.

    To define the default RAM used for risk assessments across AI systems, set the `sn_grc_ai_gov.aisystem_primary_ram` property.

    For more information, see [Set up AI Risk and Compliance properties](configure-airc-properties.md).

    **Important:** To enable risk score roll-up across AI assets, install the Advanced Risk application and set the Migrate to Advanced Risk Assessments property to Yes. This is a one-way configuration change that permanently transitions risk calculation and roll-up behavior to the Advanced Risk framework. See [Set up Advanced Risk assessments properties](advanced-risk-assessments-properties-airc.md).

## Risk assessment methodologies

Risk assessment methodologies \(RAMs\) define the scoring frameworks, classification criteria, and contributing factors used to evaluate risks associated with AI assets.

RAMs are used during intake, asset-level risk assessments, and bulk risk assessment projects. The content pack provides default RAMs, and administrators can create custom RAMs to meet organizational requirements.

**Important:** Automated and advanced risk scoring behavior depends on RAM configuration. To enable risk score roll-up across AI assets, install the Advanced Risk application and migrate to Advanced Risk Assessments. This is a one-way configuration change.

## Automated risk classification powered by use &amp; purpose submission, smart assessment, and risk assessment

Automated Risk Classification connects intake screening, assessments, and risk evaluation into a single governance flow. Information captured during the intake request, specifically responses provided by the Product Owner in the Use and Purpose section, is reused across subsequent assessments and contributes directly to how AI systems are classified as High, Medium, or Low risk.

Assessment templates, RAMs, and Post Assessment Actions work together to help ensure that qualitative context, regulatory impact, and quantitative risk scoring are consistently applied throughout the AI governance life cycle.

A typical assessment sequence for an AI system demonstrates how these components are interconnected:

1.  During intake, the Automated risk classification for AI system RAM evaluates responses captured in the Use and Purpose section of the AI use case request and assigns an initial regulatory risk classification.
2.  During the Assess phase, the risk assessment captures information about the system’s potential impact on privacy, fairness, and other fundamental rights. Responses from the Use and Purpose section are carried forward to provide continuity and reduce duplicate data entry.
3.  Post Assessment Actions evaluate the risk assessment responses and automatically associate applicable risk statements and control objectives with the assessment record based on configured automation rules.
4.  An AI Risk and Compliance analyst reviews the prescribed list of generated risks and control objectives to validate accuracy, relevance, and applicability before governance records are finalized.
5.  After the assessment is marked as closed complete, the system generates risk and control records and maps them to the AI asset. The Risk assessment for AI inventory RAM then evaluates each identified risk using quantitative scoring to calculate inherent and residual risk scores.
6.  For AI systems subject to the EU AI Act, additional assessments such as the EU AI Act Conformity Assessment and the Fundamental Rights Impact Assessment \(FRIA\) provide specialized regulatory evaluation.

Throughout this progression, assessment outcomes and risk scores inform governance decisions about whether an AI system can advance to the next life-cycle phase. For an overview of how these activities align with life-cycle stages, see [AI governance life cycle](ai-gov-lifecycle.md).

**Note:** Automated risk classification provides early risk context only. It doesn’t approve deployment, initiate life-cycle workflows, or replace downstream impact or risk assessments.
