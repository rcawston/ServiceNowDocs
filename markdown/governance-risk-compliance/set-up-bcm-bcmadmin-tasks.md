# General administration setup for BCM

If you are the BCM administrator, you can set up the Business Continuity Management application by performing certain administrative tasks.

## General Administration module

The administrative tasks that are associated with the BCM application are listed in the **General Administration** module in the application UI as shown in the example.![General Administration module.](../image/gen-admin-module.png)

The Business Continuity Management administrator with the sn\_bcm.admin role is responsible to perform the administrative tasks that are associated with the Business Continuity Management application.

Business Continuity Management administrators perform these administrative tasks:

-   Configure the impact categories and documentation sections. For more information, see [Configure impact category for BIA](configure-impact-category-uib-ws.md) and [Configure documentation section](configure-doc-section-for-bcp.md).
-   Configure the element definitions, element variables, loss scenarios, and impact ratings. For more information, see [Configure element definition](configure-element-definition-bia-uib-ws.md), [Configure element variables for element definitions](configure-element-variable-uib-ws.md), [Configure loss scenarios in the plan](configure-plan-loss-scenario-uib-ws.md), and [Configure impact ratings](configure-impact-rating-uib-ws.md).
-   Configure the recovery tiers and recovery timeframes. For more information, see [Configure recovery tiers for BIA](configure-recovery-tier-bia-uib-ws.md) and [Set up recovery timeframes](configure-recovery-timeframe-bia-uib-ws.md).
-   View the My tasks page configurations module, approval configurations, and properties. For more information, see [My tasks page configurations](my-tasks-page-config-module.md), [Approval configuration](bcm-approval-configuration.md), and [BCM properties](bcm-properties-module.md).
-   For more information on the grid configurations and categories, see [Configure grid for BIA assessment](configure-grid-configuration-uib-ws.md) and [Configure grid categories](configure-grid-category.md).

## BIA Configuration module

The BCM administrator configures the BIA templates in the BIA Configuration module. Configuring the BIA templates is a pre-requisite for performing the business impact analysis.

The **BIA templates** menu option in the BIA Configuration module is shown in the example.![BIA Configuration module.](../image/bia-config-module.png)

For more information on configuring a BIA template, see [Configure BIA templates with legacy assessment](configure-bia-template-uib-ws.md).

## Plan Templates module

The Business Continuity Management administrator uses the **Plan Templates** module to configure a business continuity plan template. The **Plan Templates** module is shown in the example.![Plan Templates module.](../image/plan-templates-module.png)

For more information on configuring a business continuity plan template, see [Configuring plan template](bcp-admin-plan-templates.md).

-   **[Dependency Configuration records](dependency-config-modules.md)**  
The BCM administrators configure the Dependency Configuration records.
-   **[Configure impact category for BIA](configure-impact-category-uib-ws.md)**  
Configure an impact category for your business, when you are performing the business impact analysis. Use the **Impact Categories** module in the Business Continuity Management application navigator to define the name, criteria that the impact category contributes to, applicable timeframes, maximum RTO value, and so on.
-   **[Configuring the documentation section](bcp-admin-documentation-sections.md)**  
You can configure the documentation section of a business continuity plan in a structured format. You can describe high level details of the plan such as its purpose, scope, coverage areas, goals, and success criteria.
-   **[Configure element definition](configure-element-definition-bia-uib-ws.md)**  
Configure element definitions to identify the configuration item that has to be assessed in a business impact analysis and recovered in a business continuity plan. Use the **Element Definitions** module in the Business Continuity Management application navigator to configure an element definition.
-   **[Configure element variables for element definitions](configure-element-variable-uib-ws.md)**  
Configure an element variable for a specific dependency of an element. To do this, use the **Element variables** module in the Business Continuity Management application navigator.
-   **[Configure loss scenarios in the plan](configure-plan-loss-scenario-uib-ws.md)**  
Configure a plan for an identified loss scenario by using the loss scenario template in the Business Continuity Management application. Use the documented plan that has the needs and requirements listed for a potential disaster.
-   **[Configure impact ratings](configure-impact-rating-uib-ws.md)**  
Configure an impact rating to assess an impact category as low, moderate, high, or critical. Use the **Impact Ratings** module in the Business Continuity Management application navigator to help you measure the intensity of the loss when a business downtime occurs.
-   **[Configure recovery tiers for BIA](configure-recovery-tier-bia-uib-ws.md)**  
Configure a recovery tier with a set of business applications that follow a similar range of recovery time objective \(RTO\) values. Use the **Recovery Tiers** module in the Business Continuity Management application navigator to configure a recovery tier.
-   **[Set up recovery timeframes](configure-recovery-timeframe-bia-uib-ws.md)**  
Set up a recovery timeframe for a recovery tier. The recovery timeframe starts from when a disruptive event happens to the time when your business can resume usual operations. You can use the **Recovery Timeframes** module in the Business Continuity Management application to set up the timeline for the recovery timeframe.
-   **[Configure grid categories](configure-grid-category.md)**  
Configure a grid category such as Dependency Assessment for the grid configuration. Use the **Grid Categories** module in the Business Continuity Management application navigator to configure the grid categories.
-   **[Configure grid for BIA assessment](configure-grid-configuration-uib-ws.md)**  
Configure the grid to render the BIA dependency assessment grid with configured columns. Use the **Grid Configurations** module in the Business Continuity Management application navigator to configure the grid.
-   **[My tasks page configurations](my-tasks-page-config-module.md)**  
If you are the Business Continuity Management application user, you can use **My tasks page configurations** in the **General Administration** module to view your assigned tasks.
-   **[Approval configuration](bcm-approval-configuration.md)**  
Approver configurator provides you with capabilities to define multiple levels of approvals based on business rule definitions.
-   **[BCM properties](bcm-properties-module.md)**  
You can configure the BCM properties in the **Properties** module.
-   **[Properties installed with BCM](properties-bcm.md)**  
Properties are added with the activation of Business Continuity Management.
