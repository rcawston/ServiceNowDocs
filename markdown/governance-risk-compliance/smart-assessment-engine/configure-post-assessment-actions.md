# Configure post-assessment actions

The post-assessment actions feature in Smart Assessment Engine enables you to automate actions based on assessment responses. The template designers can predefine actions using a rule engine, such as updating fields, creating follow-up assessments, or generating other records.

## Before you begin

-   A subflow must be available and mapped to the assessment template category for which you want to configure post-assessment actions. For more information about how to create and build subflows, refer to [Create a subflow in Workflow Studio](../../build-workflows/workflow-studio/create-subflow.md) and [Building subflows](../../build-workflows/workflow-studio/subflows.md).
-   To make actions available in post-assessment workflows, link the subflow to the appropriate template category. For more information, refer to [Link subflow to template category](link-subflow-to-action-set.md).
-   The Reusable Impact Framework plugin \(sn\_impact\_fwk\) and Post Assessment Actions for Smart Assessments plugin \(sn\_smart\_imp\_auto\) must be installed.

Role required: sn\_smart\_asmt.assessment\_admin or sn\_smart\_asmt.template\_manager and sn\_smart\_imp\_auto.automation\_creator

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Assessment Workspace** to access the Assessment Workspace landing page.

2.  Create an assessment template or open an existing assessment template for which you want to configure post-assessment actions.

4.  Select **Create Automation**.

5.  Provide a unique name and a description for the automation.

6.  Add either a conditional action set or a standalone action set.

10. Select an option for the **Action type** list.

    Based on the selected action type, new fields appear requiring additional details.

    **Note:** Responses from dropdown, check box, radio, and attachment question types cannot be passed as action parameters because they are not supported.

11. Select **Activate**.

12. Acknowledge the **I understand the automation will no longer be editable** informational check box and then select **Activate**.

    The automation is now activated, and a confirmation message is displayed. When the assessor submits the assessment, the automation you set up is executed.
