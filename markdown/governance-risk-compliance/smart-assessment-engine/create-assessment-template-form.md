Purpose

</td><td>

Purpose that the new assessment template should be a member of. For example, Risk, Performance, Security, and so on.

Template purposes enforce data segregation for templates. A purpose controls which users can view a template. Each assessment template is associated with a purpose. To view a template within a specific purpose, you must have a category role associated with that purpose.

For more information, see [Create an assessment template category](sae-asmnt-template-category-create.md)

</td></tr><tr><td>

Assessment target

</td><td>

Table records that are selected to be assessed, otherwise known as the assessment scope. Multiple tables can be added as the assessment target, which makes the scope a combination of records from each table.**Note:** Assessment targets \(context items\) are configured after the template is created, not during initial creation. Adding assessment targets requires the sn\_smart\_asmt.assessment\_admin role and can only be done while the template is in draft state.
