Persons who are notified of the assessment and typically respond to the assessment or assign it to another user. One assessment instance is assigned to each assessor.

 Assessors have the Assessment actor \[sn\_smart\_asmt.actor\] role. See [Roles installed in Smart Assessment Engine](sae-roles-defined.md).

Template category

Category that the assessment template should be a member of. For example, Risk, Performance, Security, Personal data, and so on.

Template purposes enforce data segregation for templates. A purpose controls which users can view a template. Each assessment template is associated with a purpose. To view a template within a specific purpose, you must have a category role associated with that purpose.

For more information, see [Create an assessment template category](sae-asmnt-template-category-create.md).**Note:** You can create an assessment only from a published assessment template.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Assessment target

</td><td>

Table records that are selected to be assessed, otherwise known as the assessment scope. Multiple tables can be added as the assessment target, which makes the scope a combination of records from each table.
