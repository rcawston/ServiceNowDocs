# Classic assessment configuration

The TPR manager and TPR admin roles involve a broad variety of responsibilities. After the TPRM base system is set up, you configure additional settings that enable and enhance everyday risk-assessment tasks.

## Assessment setup overview

By performing the tasks in the Assessment setup checklist for TPRM, you’re setting up and configuring the TPRM application to address your unique requirements for scoring and assessing risk for third parties, engagements, and other entities using the classic assessment engine.

**Note:**

For any custom messages you create, it is your responsibility to generate the corresponding `sys_ui_message` records. This step is crucial if you want the custom messages to be extracted and translated.

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Set up risk rating scales for scoring assessments and questionnaires.

</td><td>

You can configure the risk rating scale that is selected by default for all questionnaires.

For more information, see [Set up risk rating scales for scoring](tprm-risk-rating-scales-config.md).Role required: admin or sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_risk\_manager

</td></tr><tr><td>

Set up third-party risk domains or areas.

</td><td>

You can configure the scoring method and weight that is selected by default for all third parties associated with a specific risk area.

For more information, see [Define a third-party risk domain](tprm-risk-domain-define.md).Role required: sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_risk\_manager

</td></tr><tr><td>

Set up third-party risk area criteria, which are the group of risk domains or areas that apply to a type of third party.

</td><td>

You can adjust the weight and scoring method of each risk area within a criteria definition.

 For more information, see [Define third-party risk area criteria](tprm-risk-domain-criteria-df.md).Role required: sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_risk\_manager

</td></tr><tr><td>

Set up third party and engagement component criteria.

</td><td>

Components are entities that can be assessed for risk. Component criteria are groups of components that are related to a particular type of third party or engagement.

 You can’t add new components or modify existing ones. You can, however, define the criteria \(in terms of scoring method and weight\) to be used to assess the components. You can update the **Default scoring method** to specify how multiple scores for each risk area are calculated. You can use the **Default weight** to adjust the weight of third-party provider scores in the third party's overall risk rating.

 The following component classifications are available.

-   Third-party components
    -   Third-party risk assessments \(External risk assessments\)
    -   Subsidiaries
    -   Engagements
    -   Risk intelligence rating
-   Engagement components
    -   Engagement risk assessments
    -   Product
    -   Principal
    -   Facility
    -   Other

 For more information on setting up component criteria, see [Define component criteria](tprm-component-criteria-define.md).

 For more information on how engagement components impact third-party elements, see [Monitoring third-party elements](tprm-monitor-tp-elements.md).

 Role required: sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_risk\_manager

</td></tr><tr><td>

Set up third-party and engagement risk scoring rules.

</td><td>

Define the criteria, based on risk scores, that determine which third parties or engagements require assessments. Third-party risk scoring rules apply to subsidiaries, engagements, and third-party risk areas. Engagement risk scoring rules only apply to engagements.

For more information, see [Define third-party risk scoring rules](tprm-tp-risk-scoring-rules-define.md) and [Define engagement risk scoring rules](tprm-engagement-scoring-rules-df.md).Role required: sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_risk\_manager

</td></tr><tr><td>

Create questionnaire or document request templates.

</td><td>

You can reuse questionnaire templates and document-request templates to streamline the creation of new questionnaires and document requests.

The following template classifications are available.-   Questionnaire template
-   Document request template
-   Tiering questionnaire template
-   Fourth-party template
-   IRQ template
-   Collection template

For more information, see [Create a questionnaire or document request template](create-questionnaire-template.md) and [Create a questionnaire or document request template using the Designer](create-question-template.md).Role required: admin or sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_risk\_admin

</td></tr><tr><td>

Import questionnaires using an excel spreadsheet.

</td><td>

This task is optional.After preparing your excel spreadsheet, you can import your data and then create questionnaires automatically from templates.

For more information, see [Import a questionnaire from a spreadsheet](import-questions-from-excel.md).Role required: sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_risk\_manager

</td></tr><tr><td>

Set up a metric category \(question bank\), which is a group of questions related to a type of an assessment.

</td><td>

Add questions to a question bank so that you can reuse sets of questions in a questionnaire template. You can add new questions and questions from existing questionnaires.

For more information, see [Set up and maintain a question bank](tprm-question-bank-create.md).Role required: admin or sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_risk\_admin

</td></tr><tr><td>

Create questions to meet your assessment requirements.

</td><td>

You can create custom questions, add existing questions, or add and customize the sample questions that are included with the base system.

For more information, see [Define a question](tprm-questions-create.md).Role required: admin or sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_risk\_manager

</td></tr><tr><td>

Set up option to use normalized values for scoring.

</td><td>

You can use the **Maximum normalization input** setting to use normalized values to calculate assessment scores for Choice or Multiple Selection questions with the scored check box not selected. Normalization of values can help ensure consistent comparisons across different entities.

For more information on how this setting impacts scoring, see [Normalize the scores for metrics](set-max-norm-input.md).**Note:** This option is available under the question type tab of an assessment metric \(question\) record. For more information on setting up questions, see [Define a question](tprm-questions-create.md).

Role required: admin or sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_risk\_manager
