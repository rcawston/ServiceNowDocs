# Add entities manually

Add entities manually from the Operational Resilience Workspace as an optional step once pillars, entity types, and entity filters are active. Entities are individual records matching your filter criteria. Automatic generation is recommended for most scenarios; manual addition is available for exceptions.

1.  Navigate to the **Workspaces** &gt; **Operational Resilience Workspace** &gt; **List view** and select a business service or business process for which you want to generate entities.

2.  To add a business service or business process, select **New**.

    The example shows how to add a business service from the Operational Resilience Workspace.
