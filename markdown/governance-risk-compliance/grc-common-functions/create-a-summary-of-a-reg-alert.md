# Generate a regulatory alert summary

Generate a summary of a new regulatory alert for a quick analysis of the alert using the regulatory alert summarization skill. Summarized alerts help compliance officers, regulatory managers, and legal teams quickly understand the impact of new regulations.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_grc\_reg\_change.user and sn\_grc\_comp\_genai.reg\_change\_ai\_user

For more information on related roles and regulatory alerts, see [Types of alerts, user roles, and states of regulatory alerts](../regulatory-change-management-service-portal/user_roles_and_actions.md).

## About this task

Install the Now Assist for IRM application to generate regulatory alert summaries. For more information, see [Now Assist for Integrated Risk Management \(IRM\)](now-assist-for-irm.md).

**Important:** This Now Assist skill is turned on by default. The skill will be automatically available to appropriate role users for the application. For more information, see [Now Assist skills, agents, and agentic workflows on by default](../../intelligent-experiences/now-assist-skills/now-assist-skills-on-by-default.md).

The summary for a regulatory alert is generated based on the prompts set during the configuration of the summarization skill. For example, if you select important dates, regulatory authority, summary of changes, penalties, and fines as key details to capture, the summary includes that information. After the summary is generated, you can directly use the summary and save it in the activity stream of the regulatory alert.

Starting with version 19.0.x, users who have the Now Assist for IRM application installed can use the regulatory alert summarization, recommend alert impacted citations, and regulatory alert impacted control objectives skills.

**Important:** Be sure to check AI-generated summaries for accuracy. If no information is available, the generated summary displays “**No specific information available for penalty or fines and so on"**.

By default, all skills exist in the global domain. When you use Now Assist in a domain-separated environment, users are only able to access data in their domain. For example, if a user uses the summarization skill, Now Assist only uses material that exists in the user's domain when generating that summary. Additionally, there is no co-mingling of data for domain-separated instances when using generative AI skills. The data resides only on the instance, and the shared services used for generative AI do not persist any requests \(prompts\) and responses. For more information, see [Domain separation in the Now Assist Admin console](../../intelligent-experiences/domain-separation-in-the-now-assist-admin-console.md). \(Note that global domain is not the same as global scope. For more information, see [Exploring Next Experience pickers](../../platform-user-interface/next-experience-pickers.md).\)

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to one of the following locations:

    -   **Workspaces** &gt; **Compliance Workspace**, select the list icon ![](../../grc-cam-workspace/image/ws-list-icon.png) and then navigate to **Regulatory alerts**.
    -   **Workspaces** &gt; **Compliance Workspace** select the Regulatory Change Management dashboard icon ![](../../grc-rcm/image/reg-change-icon.png) and then in the Activity overview, Tracking, or Trends section, select any segment or value in an Alerts related widget to open the list of regulatory alerts with that state.
