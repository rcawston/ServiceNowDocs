# Generate regulatory action plan agentic workflow

The generate regulatory action plan workflow uses generative AI to create actionable compliance steps for regulatory alerts. It supports organizations in organizing risk mitigation activities and maintaining alignment with regulatory requirements.

## Generate regulatory action plan agentic workflow overview

If you have the RCM user \[sn\_grc\_reg\_change.user\] role and the sn\_grc\_comp\_genai.reg\_change\_ai\_agent\_user role, you can generate regulatory action plans using the generate regulatory action plan agentic workflow in the Now Assist panel.

This workflow analyzes impacted areas and similar historical alerts to create change tasks and action tasks that help implement regulatory change.

After the workflow is started, the regulatory change task planning agent identifies the optimal steps for working on a regulatory alert by referencing the past similar regulatory alert details and impacted areas of the current regulatory alert, so that the output includes a clear, categorized set of tasks grouped by type, complete with key dates and source references for traceability.

Key Inputs:

-   Impacted areas identified by recommendation skills
-   Regulatory alert details \(Title, Description, Effective date, Compliance date\)
-   Historical alerts for pattern matching

Processing Jobs:

Regulatory change task planning agent: Validates impacted areas, analyzes historical alerts for similar compliance actions, and generates structured action plans grouped by task type \(control updates, policy revisions, citation amendments\).

Key Outputs:

-   Action plan displayed in the **Regulatory tasks** tab
-   Tasks categorized by impacted area type with ownership and timelines
-   Option to accept or dismiss the proposed plan

You can get started by selecting **Generate action plan** from the Ask Now Assist action menu on a regulatory alert page or by selecting **Generate Regulatory Action Plan** from the Now Assist panel.

Integrated within the Now Assist panel, this workflow provides a seamless experience for users, helping to reduce manual effort and improve accuracy while supporting multiple regulatory domains and task types.

For more information, see [Use agentic AI in Now Assist for Integrated Risk Management \(IRM\)](use-agentic-ai-in-risk-sustainability.md), [Activate the generate regulatory action plan agentic workflow](activate-rcm-agent-actions-workflow.md), and [Generate regulatory action plans](generate_regulatory_action_plans.md).

## Benefits of the workflow

-   Automated action plan creation: Eliminates manual drafting by generating structured regulatory action plans for each alert.
-   Leverages historical data: Analyzes similar past alerts and action plans to recommend accurate, proven tasks.
-   Consolidated and organized tasks: Creates change tasks and action tasks grouped by impacted areas for easier assignment and tracking.
-   Improved consistency and accuracy: Reduces variability in compliance responses through AI-driven recommendations.
-   Faster implementation: Converts compliance strategies into actionable tasks with clear ownership and timelines.
-   Integration with Now Assist panel: Provides a seamless experience for accessing generative AI capabilities within Regulatory Change Management \( RCM\).
-   Supports multiple task types: Enables adding multiple regulatory tasks and source document import tasks to a single alert.

**Note:** Only users with sn\_grc\_reg\_change.user and sn\_grc\_comp\_genai.reg\_change\_ai\_agent\_user roles can access this workflow.
