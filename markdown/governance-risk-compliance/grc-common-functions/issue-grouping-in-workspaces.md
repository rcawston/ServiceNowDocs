# Group issues in the Workspace

Group issues within your workspaces to organize and manage related issues. Grouping similar issues can streamline your workflow and save time.

## Before you begin

Role required: risk\_admin, risk\_manager, or sn\_risk.user

## About this task

Grouping issues under a parent can streamline your workflow and save time. All child issues are managed under a single parent, making it easier to track and address them collectively. You can group different types of issues under a single parent when issues belong to the same project or audit to gain a holistic view of how different issues are managed. Grouping issues under a parent helps in organizing and prioritizing them, reducing the redundancy of solving similar issues, and ensuring that issues are addressed in a coordinated manner.

You can enable the **Advanced issue grouping functionality** property to use the advanced issue grouping features, such as management methods for issue grouping and making standalone issues into parents. For more information, see [Governance, Risk, and Compliance properties](grc-properties.md).

**Important:** When you group issues with confidentiality enabled, you can add confidential child issues only under a confidential parent issue.
