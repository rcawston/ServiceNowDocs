# Configure Now Assist for Integrated Risk Management \(IRM\)

If you have the admin role, you can configure Now Assist for IRM so that your agents can use the generative AI skills in the IRM workspace.

## Now Assist for IRM Configuration overview

**Important:** After installing Now Assist for IRM, all Now Assist for IRM skills and agentic workflows are activated by default.

Use the Now Assist Admin console to configure Now Assist for IRM. This console contains everything that you need to install plugins and configure the generative AI skills. For additional information, see [Overview tab in Now Assist Admin](../../intelligent-experiences/configuring-now-assist.md).

For earlier versions, go to [Application Manager](../../platform-administration/application-manager/application-manager.md) to upgrade it to a later version.

For information about configuring generative AI skills and prompts, see [Configuring Now Assist Admin features](../../intelligent-experiences/configuring-na-landing.md).

**Note:** Depending on your license, you will have access to certain application features, generative AI skills, agentic workflows, and AI agents. For more information, see [ServiceNow product tiers](../../intelligent-experiences/ai-native-sku-overview.md).
