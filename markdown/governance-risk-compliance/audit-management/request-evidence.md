# Request evidence for audit

Request evidence at any stage during an audit. The details about the items for which evidence is requested are also provided to the person responsible for providing the evidence.

## Before you begin

Role required: The role required for Audit Management is sn\_audit.user.

Following are the roles required for Lite Audit:

-   sn\_grc\_advanced.evidence\_reader
-   sn\_grc\_advanced.evidence\_requester
-   sn\_grc\_advanced.evidence\_responder
-   sn\_grc\_advanced.evidence\_admin

## About this task

An evidence can be requested in the following three ways:

-   By creating an evidence record from the **My Evidence** module.
-   From the Entity, Control, Audit Task, Control Test Issue, and Other Issues related lists in an engagement record. To request evidence from these sources, navigate to **Audit** &gt; **Engagements** &gt; **My Engagements**. Open the engagement record, and select the related list from which you want to request evidence. From the **Action on selected rows** list, select **Request Evidence**. Here, you can either create a new evidence request or add more requests to an existing evidence request. The Evidence request is created but not evidence request tasks.

    Select **Create a new evidence request task** in the **Request evidence** page to create request task.![](../image/evidence-request.png)

-   From the following tables: Entity, Control, Control Objective, Control Test, Engagement, Issue. However, when the users request evidence from these tables, the evidence request is created not the actual evidence request task. The users must go to the evidence request record that is generated and then add evidence request tasks.

In this procedure, the method to request evidence from the **My Evidence** module is described.

## Procedure
