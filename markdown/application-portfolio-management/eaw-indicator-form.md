Data source

</td><td>

Defines the location from which the indicator receives data.

 -   **Performance Analytics**: Collects scores from indicators created in Performance Analytics. See [Performance Analytics indicators](../now-intelligence/performance-analytics/c_Indicators.md).
-   **Custom Script**: Allows you to write a script that collects data from another application. Beneath the **Data Source** field, a sample script appears. Customize the script as needed.
-   **Query Condition**: Allows you to select a table to run filters on to obtain data.
-   **Assessments**: Allows you to evaluate, score, and rank records by assessing records in a table. See [Create metric types and generate assessable records](../servicenow-platform/t_CreatMetricTypesAndGenAssessRecs.md).
-   **Indicators**: Allows you to add dependent child indicators. Through the child indicators, data is gathered to the parent indicator.

For example, if the parent indicator is number of issues, the dependent indicators can be number of incident counts, number of problems, and changes. These dependent indicators are child indicators and the number of incidents, problems, and changes recorded are consolidated up to the parent indicator as the number of issues.

The **Indicator** field appears when **Performance Analytics** is selected from the **Data source** list.Indicators are statistics that are used to measure current conditions and forecast trends.

 **Note:** If the collection frequency of the application indicator is not greater than the frequency at which the data of the Performance Analytic indicator are generated, then the system displays an error message: `Frequency of the indicator must always be greater than or equal to the frequency of the datasource configuration indicator`.

</td></tr><tr><td>

</td></tr><tr><td>

Normalization script

</td><td>

A script to evaluate and score business applications and capabilities using standardized metrics. It involves using indicators that provide a normalized score for the condition they are evaluating. These indicators can be based on assessments, query conditions, custom scripts, or performance analytics.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Consolidation

</td><td>

Computational method for aggregating the values, a function such as sum, average, maximum, or minimum.Default is Average. For example, Average is the sum of the monthly values divided by the total number of months in a quarter.

 If you select Maximum or Minimum, then it’s the maximum value or the minimum value of a month in the quarter, respectively.

 If you select Sum, then it’s an aggregate of all monthly values in the quarter.
