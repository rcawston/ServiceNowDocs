## Before you begin

4.  Add a shape to an existing or new diagram.

    You can observe that the unsynced icon \(![unsynced shape](../../image/eaw-image/modeling/icon-unsynced.png)\) is displayed in the shape. It means, the shape hasn’t yet synced with the ServiceNow database.

5.  Open the side panel with details for the selected shape by selecting the Open the side panel icon \(![Open side panel](../../image/eaw-image/modeling/icon-open-side-panel.png)\).

    -   To create a CI, select the **Create New** button and enter the details.
7.  Send the shape or diagram for approval.
