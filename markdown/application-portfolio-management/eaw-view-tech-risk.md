# View TPM risk details

View all the Technology Portfolio Management \(TPM\) risk data for software products that are facing high and moderate technology risks.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_apm.apm\_user

## About this task

You can use the TPM risk scores to manage and mitigate the risks associated with your software products and hardware models.

The TPM risk details of software products and hardware models are calculated based on their lifecycle dates that are the end of support, end of extended support, and end of life dates. The sum of the related software and hardware risk score is the risk score of an application service. And the sum of the related application service risk score is considered as the risk score of a business application.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Enterprise Architecture Workspace**.

2.  Open the Technology Portfolio page by selecting the Technology Portfolio icon ![Technology portfolio icon](../../image/eaw-image/technology-portfolio-icon.png).

3.  Select **TPM risk**.

    To update the TPM risk scores, you must run the **Populate Technology Lifecycles Risks** job. For more details, see [Schedule a job to generate TPM technology risk](eaw-schedule-job-generate-tpm-risk.md).
