# Amazon Web Services \(AWS\) shapes

The AWS shapes library in EA Workspace helps in modeling cloud architectures. These shapes allow architects to design future-state cloud diagrams aligned with CMDB and CSDM standards.

## AWS shapes in Enterprise Modeling and Visualization

You can add a shape to the canvas by either selecting the shape or by dragging the shape from the **Shapes**

You can also adjust the size of shapes by selecting a shape and then drag any of its edges or corner handles. Pulling outward increases the shape's dimensions, while dragging inward reduces its size.
