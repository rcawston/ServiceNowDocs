# Update TPM data for a business application or application service

Manually update the Technology Portfolio Management \(TPM\) lifecycle data including end of support date, end of extended support date, and end of life date for your software and hardware models for your business applications and application services.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_apm.apm\_user

## About this task

You can refresh the TPM lifecycle data manually for a selected business application or application service. A scheduled job **Populate TPM Discovered Technologies and Lifecycles** is also run on schedule or on-demand to update the lifecycle data for all business applications and application services​​.

**Note:** The data for software products is displayed only when the Software Asset Management \(SAM\) Foundation or Software Asset Management \(SAM\) Professional plugin is installed.

TPM lifecycle record identifiers are automatically generated on creating a TPM record using the Technology Portfolio Management \(sn\_apm\_tpm\) plugin version 1.9.0. However, for TPM lifecycle records generated using previous versions of the TPM plugin don't have any lifecycle record identifiers. The TPM record identifiers of these TPM lifecycle records must be generated using the Populate Number field in TPM Discovered Technologies job. For information, see [Run a scheduled job to populate Technology Portfolio Management lifecycle record identifier](eaw-run-job-to-populate-tpm-lifecycle-identifier.md).
