# Application plugin installation sequence for Enterprise Architecture Workspace

The following table provides the list of plugins for Enterprise Architecture Workspace, a high-level description of each plugin, and the dependencies that are required before installing each plugin.

**Warning:** type="warning"&gt;Before activating a plugin listed in the Plugin name column, verify that you activate all corresponding dependencies listed in the Plugin dependencies column from the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com).

## Enterprise Architecture Workspace application plugin list

When you activate Enterprise Architecture Workspace \(`com.snc.apm_workspace`\), ServiceNow automatically activates several dependent plugins. These are listed as **Automatic** in the Activation column. The remaining plugins must be activated manually in the order shown in the [Enterprise Architecture Workspace plugin activation sequence](eaw-plugin-activation-sequence.md#application-plugin-installation-sequence-for-enterprise-architecture-workspace) section.

**Tip:** The auto-activated plugin list may vary depending on your instance version. To confirm the exact dependencies for your version, check the Plugin Manager before activation.
