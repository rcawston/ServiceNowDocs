# Working with Enterprise Modeling and Visualization

Enterprise Modeling and Visualization provides a structured, visual framework for managing the complex relationships between IT systems, business processes, and organizational goals.

With Enterprise Modeling and Visualization, you can create and maintain architecture diagrams using built‑in shape libraries such as General, Common Service Data Model, Amazon Web Services, Enterprise Architecture Extended, ArchiMate, and Business Process Model and Notation. You can connect shapes with relationship lines and label connectors to represent architectural relationships.

Associate shapes with existing records, such as business applications, capabilities, and application services, and use the side panel to view or update record details directly from the canvas.

You can manage diagram evolution by saving changes as new versions. Versioning enables you to maintain a history of architecture decisions and switch between versions using the version selector. You can also compare different versions of a diagram and generate a summary of the changes.

The workspace supports collaboration and governance by enabling you to share diagrams with stakeholders and submit them for review and approval using the built‑in approval workflow. After approval, you can synchronize the diagram with your repository to update the underlying records.

**Note:**

After upgrading from Q2 2025 or Q3 2025 releases to the Q4 2025 release of Enterprise Architecture Workspace, you might observe that newly created shapes display color, while existing shapes for the same entity don’t.

The Q4 2025 release of Enterprise Architecture Workspace release introduced color styling to the shape library. Consequently, diagrams created in Q3 don’t display color. Following the upgrade, new shapes added to these older diagrams display color, but the previously existing shapes remain uncolored.

To update the shapes in the previously created diagrams, do the following:

-   For upgrades from Q3 to Q4- You must explicitly run the relevant fix script \(script name: Clean edges and synchronize shape names and met", sys\_id: "2a63972eff22621076fdffffffffffbe\). This is because the script was present in the Q3 release and has been modified for Q4.
-   The script runs automatically as part of the upgrade process.

Create a diagram and synchronize it to the ServiceNow database.
-   **[Add labels to connector lines between shapes in a diagram](eaw-modeling-add-labels-to-connector-lines.md)**  
You can enhance diagram clarity in Enterprise Modeling and Visualization by adding a descriptive text on the connector line between shapes. Connector line labels clarify the nature of the relationship between shapes, annotate the data flow direction, and provide contextual information.
-   **[Working with business capability map](eaw-work-with-bc-map.md)**  
Model your business capabilities map using the Enterprise Modeling and Visualization. Update existing capability maps by adding other business capabilities and business applications.
-   **[Working with business hierarchy map](eaw-work-with-ba-map.md)**  
Model your business application hierarchy using the Enterprise Modeling and Visualization. Update an existing business hierarchy map by adding more shapes and relationships.
-   **[Working with business process map](eaw-work-with-bp-map.md)**  
Working with business process diagrams in Enterprise Modeling and Visualization.A business process modeling BPMN \(Business Process Model and Notation\) diagram is a visual representation of a structured sequence of tasks aimed at achieving specific outcomes. It helps you to establish a shared understanding of processes, identify inefficiencies or bottlenecks, optimize and streamline workflows.
-   **[Working with ArchiMate Shapes](eaw-work-with-archimate-shapes.md)**  
ArchiMate® shapes are the industry-standard elements used by enterprise architects to create diagrams that represent relationship across different domains of an enterprise. These shapes are used to model business, application, motivation, physical, strategy, and technology layers.
-   **[Working with Amazon Web Services \(AWS\) shapes](eaw-work-with-aws-shapes.md)**  
AWS is a cloud computing platform, used for cloud migration, application hosting, and digital transformation, making it critical for enterprise architecture planning. AWS shapes are part of the Cloud Architecture modeling capability. They enable architects to visualize AWS cloud components, model hybrid architectures, and support cloud migration planning and future-state architecture design.
-   **[Working with CSDM shapes](eaw-work-with-csdm-shapes.md)**  
Common Service Data Model \(CSDM\) is a standardized framework and CMDB data model provided by ServiceNow. It defines service-related terms, tables, and relationships across the Now Platform to ensure consistency in how services, applications, and infrastructure are represented. In Enterprise Architecture Workspace, CSDM shapes are visual elements that represent entities on diagrams for modeling and analysis.
-   **[Working with custom shapes](eaw-working-custom-shapes.md)**  
Custom shapes represent specific elements that are unique to your organization. Manage custom shapes, create diagram actions for the shapes in the Enterprise Architecture Workspace.
-   **[Convert a shape to a group shape](eaw-modeling-group-ungroup-shape.md)**  
Group shapes enable you to combine multiple related shapes into a single container for better organization and clarity in diagrams. It’s useful for representing logical groupings such as a set of applications under a business capability, related processes under a value stream stage.
-   **[Expand or collapse a group shape](eaw-modeling-expand-collapse-shape.md)**  
The expand and collapse functionality for a group shape helps in simplifying visualization, improves focus, and supports hierarchical modeling.
-   **[Download a modeling diagram as an image](eaw-modeling-download-diagram.md)**
