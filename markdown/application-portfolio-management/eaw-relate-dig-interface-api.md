# Connect a digital interface with the CMDB API in the EA Workspace

Create a relationship between a digital interface and a CMDB API. The relationship helps you find out which digital integration uses which API, which APIs are built out of the design specs of the digital interface, and what environments are deployed. The relationship helps to group the deployed APIs.

## Before you begin

Activate the CMDB CI Class Models \[app-cmdb-content\] store app \(version 1.49.0 or later\). For instructions, see [CMDB CI Class Models app](../servicenow-platform/cmdb-ci-class-models/cmdb-ci-class-models.md).

Role required: sn\_apm.apm\_analyst

## About this task

One digital interface can be connected to one or more APIs. One API can be connected to only one digital interface.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workspaces** &gt; **Enterprise Architecture Workspace**.

2.  In the left navigation, open the Portfolio List view by selecting the Portfolio icon \(![Portfolio icon](../../image/portfolio-icon.png)\).

3.  Select the expand row icon \(![Expand Row icon](../../image/ExpandIcon.png)\) next to **Application Portfolio**.

4.  Select **Digital Interfaces**.

5.  Select an existing digital interface.

6.  Select the **APIs** tab.

7.  Select **New**.

8.  On the Digital Interface to API form, fill in the fields.

    For field descriptions, see [Digital interface to API form](eaw-dig-interface-api-form.md). Information for the fields Environment, Lifecycle Stage, and Lifecycle Stage Status are derived from the API. ![Connect digital interface to API](../../image/eaw-image/eaw-dig-interface-to-api.png)

9.  Select **Save**.
