# Update a business capability map

Modify an existing business capability map by adding new capabilities, business applications, or changing the hierarchy of the existing capabilities.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_apm.apm\_user

**Note:** You must have the Owner or Editor access to the artifact or diagram.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Enterprise Architecture Workspace**.

2.  Open the Modeling page by selecting the Enterprise Modeling and Visualization icon \(![Enterprise Modeling and Visualization icon](../../image/eaw-image/modeling/icon-modeling-logo.png)\).

3.  Open an existing capability map artifact from the **Diagrams** page.

    By default, two levels of hierarchy are displayed. Use the down arrow in a capability box to expand and see the next level capabilities.

4.  Update the map as required.

    -   Move the capabilities from one capability to another capability. Use the **Update hierarchies** button on the Business Portfolio page to refresh the IDs of all the capabilities according to the changes in the committed diagram.
    -   To add a new business capability or a business application to the hierarchy map, select the **Add** drop-down menu and then select **Business Capability** or **Business Application**. Drag on the new capability or business application on to a business capability to add the relationship.
    -   To apply a color to a capability, select the capability box and select the color that you want to apply from the color pallet.
    All the updates are auto-saved.

5.  Select **Commit changes** to synchronize the diagram to the database.

    This option is available only when the diagram is approved. For more information, see [Synchronize a shape to the database](eaw-modeling-sync-shape.md).

6.  Select **Share** to share the diagram with individuals or groups.

    For more information, see [Share a modeling diagram](eaw-modeling-share-diagram.md).

7.  Select the More Actions menu \(![More actions menu.](../../image/icon-three-dot-menu-eaw.png)\) to perform the following actions:

    -   **Save as new version**: Select this option to create a version for the selected diagram. The version number is automatically added in the Version number field, and it isn’t editable. For more information, see [Save as a new version](eaw-modeling-save-as-new.md).
    -   **Duplicate**: Select this option to duplicate the diagram. For more information, see [Duplicate a modeling diagram](eaw-modeling-duplicate.md).
    -   **Submit for approval**: Select this option to submit the diagram for approval. The approval process can be done through a configured workflow. By default, the approval request is submitted to the Enterprise Architect group. For more information, see [Submit a modeling diagram for approval](eaw-modeling-submit-for-approval.md).
