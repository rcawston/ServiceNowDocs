# Run a scheduled job to populate Technology Portfolio Management lifecycle record identifier

Run the Populate Number field in TPM Discovered Technologies job to populate missing Technology Portfolio Management \(TPM\) lifecycle record identifiers.

## Before you begin

Ensure the Technology Portfolio Management \(sn\_apm\_tpm\) plugin version 1.9.0. is installed and activated.

Role required: admin

## About this task

TPM lifecycle record identifiers are automatically generated on creating a TPM record using the Technology Portfolio Management \(sn\_apm\_tpm\) plugin version 1.9.0. However, for TPM lifecycle records generated using previous versions of the TPM plugin don't have any lifecycle record identifiers. The TPM record identifiers of these TPM lifecycle records must be generated using the Populate Number field in TPM Discovered Technologies job.
