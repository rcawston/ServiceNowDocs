# Add related records in the modeling diagram

Fetch and add a related record to the selected shape in a diagram.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_apm.apm\_user and Owner or Editor access to the artifact or diagram

## About this task

You can add both upstream and downstream related entities to a shape in a diagram.

-   Upstream entities appear as the parents of a selected shape. They represent inputs, dependencies, or higher-level components that influence the selected shape. For example, for a business process, an upstream entity can be a business capability.
-   Downstream entities appear as children of the selected shape. They represent the outputs or consequences that are influenced by the selected shape. For example, for a business capability, a downstream entity can be a business application.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Enterprise Architecture Workspace**.

2.  Open the Modeling page by selecting the Enterprise Modeling and Visualization icon \(![Enterprise Modeling and Visualization icon](../../image/eaw-image/modeling/icon-modeling-logo.png)\).

3.  Select an existing diagram from the Diagrams page.

4.  Select a shape in the diagram and then open the context menu and then the More Actions menu \(![More actions menu icon](../../image/eaw-image/eaw-icon-menu.png)\).

5.  Open the **Add related records** pop-up window by selecting the Add related records icon \(![Add related records icon](../../image/eaw-image/modeling/icon-add-related-records.png)\).

6.  Select the entities that you want to add to the diagram.

    -   Select the Expand row icon \(![Expand Row icon](../../image/ExpandIcon.png)\) next to **Upstream** or **Downstream** to view the list of available related entities.
    -   Select the check box next to the relevant entity.
7.  Select **Add**.
