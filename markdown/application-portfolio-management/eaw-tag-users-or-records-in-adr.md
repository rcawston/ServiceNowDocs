# Tag users or records in Architectural Decision Records

You can tag users or records in architectural decision records \(ADR\) in the Enterprise Architecture Workspace.

## Before you begin

**Note:** The ADR feature in Enterprise Architecture Workspace uses the ServiceNow Docs component \(sn\_docs\) to create pages in the Artifacts section. Docs component v6.0.0 is automatically installed with Enterprise Architecture Workspace v3.4.0.

If you’re using an older version of Enterprise Architecture Workspace with Docs component v6.0.0, upgrade the workspace to v3.4.0 to fully use the ADR functionality. For more information, see [KB2017926](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2017926).

Role required: sn\_apm.apm\_user and you should have **Editor** access to the ADR.

## About this task

Tagging users in ADRs ensures that relevant stakeholders are aware of and can contribute to important architectural decisions. Tagging records helps you to organize relevant information systematically and locate records relevant to a particular ADR easily. The records you can tag are:

-   Architectural artifacts or diagrams
-   Business applications
-   Business capabilities
-   Business processes
-   Digital integrations
-   Digital interfaces
-   Information objects
-   TRM products
-   Value stream details
