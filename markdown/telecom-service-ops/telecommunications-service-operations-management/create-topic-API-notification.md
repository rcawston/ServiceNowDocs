# Create a topic

Create a topic and publish the incoming notifications from the external system to the topic. By creating the topics, subscribers can select the topics to which they want to subscribe.

## Before you begin

Make sure that the Telecommunications Alarm Management Open API \(sn\_ind\_tmf642\) application is installed with the ServiceNow AI Platform.

Role required: admin, sn\_api\_notif\_ mgmt.topic\_creator

## About this task

You can create topics either by manually typing the external message details or automatically collecting the available topics from the external system. When you create a topic, it creates a record in the Topic \[sn\_api\_notif\_mgmt\_topic\] table.

## Procedure

1.  **All** &gt; **Telecom API Notification** &gt; **Topics**.

2.  Select **New**.

    If you’ve integrated with an external system, you can select **Get Topics** to get the available topics automatically. This action triggers the Event Alarm Notification API subflow. To learn more about the functions that enable you to query and manipulate records in the topic, see [TopicUtilOOB - Scoped](../../api-reference/server-api-reference/TopicUtilOOBAPIScoped.md).
