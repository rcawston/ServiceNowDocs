# Telecom Juniper MX SSH Router Pattern

The ServiceNow® Telecom Discovery application uses the Telecom Juniper MX SSHRouter discovery pattern to find SNMP and CLI -based Juniper MX Series routers in the network. Discovering some of these resources requires updating the Telecommunications Discovery Patterns \(TSOM Patterns\) from the ServiceNow® store.

Telecom Discovery uses the Telecommunications Discovery Patterns to run Horizontal Discovery. This Telecommunications Discovery Pattern uses a set of SNMP requests to find and classify CLI over SSH to discover network elements.

Telecom Juniper MX SSH Router pattern is part of the Telecommunications Discovery Patterns application \(sn\_tsom\_patterns\), which is part of TSOM Visibility.
