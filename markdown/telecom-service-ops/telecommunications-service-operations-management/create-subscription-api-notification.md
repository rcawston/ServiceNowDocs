# Create a topic subscription

Subscribe to the topic in the ServiceNow AI Platform that you want respond to the incoming notification from the external system. By subscribing to the topic, the subscriber receives the notifications based on the topics that you subscribe to.

## Before you begin

-   Make sure that the Telecommunications Alarm Management Open API \(sn\_ind\_tmf642\) application is installed with the ServiceNow AI Platform.
-   Create topics for the incoming notifications.

Role required: admin, sn\_api\_notif\_mgmt.subscription\_creator

## About this task

You subscribe to the available topics for the incoming notifications from the external system, based on the customer preference. You generate the callback URL to share with the customers. When a request from an external system hits the callback URL, it initiates the creation of an event in the Event Management application.

Additionally, you register the topic subscription to start receiving the incoming notifications. When you create a topic subscription, it creates a record in the Topic Subscription \[sn\_api\_notif\_mgmt\_subscription\] table. To learn more about the methods to query and manipulate records in the Topic Subscription, see [TopicSubscriptionUtilOOB - Scoped](../../api-reference/server-api-reference/TopicSubscriptionUtilAPIScoped.md).

## Procedure

1.  **All** &gt; **Telecom API Notification** &gt; **Subscription**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.
