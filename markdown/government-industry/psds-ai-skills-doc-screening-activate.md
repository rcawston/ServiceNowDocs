## Before you begin

**Important:** Some Now Assist skills, agents, and agentic workflows are turned on by default. The default behavior works as follows:

-   **New customers**

    When you install a Now Assist product, designated skills, agents, or agentic workflows are turned on automatically.

-   **Existing customers who are upgrading \(starting with Australia Patch 4\)**

    There is no change to skills, agents, or agentic workflows that are currently enabled and customized.

    An AI asset is turned on if:

    -   The Now Assist plugin is installed, but the asset was never turned on.
    -   An admin has never adjusted roles for the skill.
    An AI asset is not turned on if:

    -   The asset was previously turned on, and then turned off again.
    -   An admin has adjusted roles for the asset.

-   Confirm that the following applications and plugins are installed:

    -   Now Assist in Document Intelligence \(sn\_docintel\_gen\_ai\)
    -   Document Processor \(sn\_doc\_processor\)
    -   Service Applicant Information \(sn\_svc\_appl\_info\)
    -   Now Assist for Public Sector Digital Services \(PSDS\)
    -   Social Benefits Playbook, Grants Management, **or** License and Permit Playbook
