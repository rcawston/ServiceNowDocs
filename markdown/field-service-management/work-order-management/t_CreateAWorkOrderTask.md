# Create a work order task

Create a work order task from a work order.

## Before you begin

Role required: wm\_qualifier or [qualifier combination role](../r_UserRoleInstallWFieldSrvMgmnt.md)

## About this task

These users can edit schedule times, including task windows and planned durations. The **Estimated end** time is calculated from the expected start time and the work duration and is read-only.

|Role|Edit capabilities|
|----|-----------------|
|wm\_qualifier|Tasks in the **Draft** state.|
|wm\_dispatcher|Tasks in the **Pending Dispatch** state.|
|wm\_admin|Tasks in **Draft** or **Pending Dispatch** state.|
|wm\_task\_initiator|Tasks in the **Draft** state.|

**Note:** You must enable the **Apply Work Order template in draft status** option and **wm\_task\_initiator** role to create tasks for the work order based on the applied template, without qualifying the work order when it is in the draft state. For more information about these configurations, see [Global domain configurations](../t_ConfigureFieldService.md) and [Roles installed with Field Service Management](../r_UserRoleInstallWFieldSrvMgmnt.md).

## Procedure

1.  Open a work order.

2.  Click the Work Order Tasks related list.

3.  Click **New**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Sub state

</td><td>

Provides a more detailed status update within the broader **State** field. -   When an agent reaches the work location, the system automatically updates the sub state to **Onsite Arrival**.
-   When an agent initiates their journey, the sub state is set as **On Route**.
These updates can be triggered by geofencing technology or other location-based tracking methods.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Territory

</td><td>

If the Territory Planning plugin is active and the territory model is enabled, the system automatically populates the best-matched territory based on the task's location. If there are multiple eligible territories, the system will populate the lowest ranked one, taking into account capacity and reservations if the corresponding plugin is installed.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Dispatch Group

</td><td>

-   Group that can select an agent to complete the task. By default, you can only select groups that belong to the location of the task. If no dispatch groups exist for the location, all dispatch groups are listed for assignment of the tasks.
-   The best match dispatch group is automatically populated based on the territory mentioned in the task only if the **Field\_Service\_Territories** territory model is enabled. For more information, see [Enable the Field Service territory model](../workforce-optimization-for-field-service/enable-territory-model.md).

**Note:** If multiple dispatch groups are populated based on the territory, then you have to select the dispatch group manually from the list.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Assignment group

</td><td>

Group that has the individual agent or vendor who will complete the task. By default, this field shows the recommended assignment groups based on the location, asset, and skills for the task. If the field is empty, the system searches for the group covering the territory that includes the location of the task.**Note:** If there are multiple assignment groups that can be serviced for a work order task, then the potential assignment groups are calculated and automatically populated based on the location and assignment groups if there are more than one that can be serviced for a work order task. Applicable only when:

-   The **sn\_fsm.update\_potential\_assignment\_groups** [system property](../r_PropInstallWFieldServMgmnt.md) is set to true.
-   More than one assignment group is found for the location.
-   Territory model is inactive.


</td></tr><tr><td>
