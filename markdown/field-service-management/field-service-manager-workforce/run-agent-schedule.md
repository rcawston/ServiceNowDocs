# Run the Populate Agents Daily Schedule Table

Trigger the Populate Agents Daily Schedule Table to run so dispatchers can see the changes that they made without having to wait for the nightly execution.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

By default the Populate Agents Daily Schedule Table runs once a day at midnight in the time zone the instance is set up in. If a dispatcher changes an agent’s schedule, it won’t reflect in the calendar in Dispatcher Workspace until the Populate Agents Daily Schedule Table runs. Administrators can trigger the table to run at any time.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System definition** &gt; **Scheduled jobs**.

2.  Under Name, search for `Populate agents daily schedule`.

3.  Select `Populate agents daily schedule`.

4.  Select **Execute Now**.

    The Populate agents daily schedule starts running and should be complete within 30 minutes.
