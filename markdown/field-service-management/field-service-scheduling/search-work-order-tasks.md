# Search work order tasks

Minimize scrolling and filter tasks that show in the task panel. Quickly search by keyword, or see all the tasks assigned to a group or territory.

## Before you begin

Role required: wm\_dispatcher

## About this task

You can search work order tasks using the following criteria:

-   Keyword
-   Match calendar dates
-   Work order task state

You can also filter and sort work order tasks based on the fields that are configured by the administrator.

If you add a work order task number to the work notes of another work order task, when you search for the work order task number that was added to the work notes both the tasks show up. This happens because it’s a keyword search that causes both the work order tasks show up. For example if you add WOT123 to the notes of WOT456, then when you search for WOT123, both WOT123 and WOT456 show up.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Field Service** &gt; **Dispatching** &gt; **Dispatcher Workspace**.

2.  Select **Dispatcher Workspace**.

3.  In the task panel, search for a work order task.

-   If the window start and window end dates of a task fall within the dates currently shown on the calendar.
-   If the window end field is empty, then the task appears if the calendar is displaying a date beyond the task's window start date.
-   If the window start field is empty, then the task appears if the calendar shows a date before the task's window end date.
-   If both the window start and window end fields are empty, then the task panel's task appears when Match calendar dates are enabled.
-   If the calendar display window is modified, the task panel is updated to display only tasks that match the new date range.
