# Activate Smart Assessment for Field Service questionnaire

You can activate the Smart Assessment for Field Service Questionnaire plugin \(sn\_fsm\_smart\_asmt\) for Field Service Management if you have the admin role. The application includes demo data and installs related ServiceNow® Store applications and plugins if they are not already installed.

## Before you begin

Smart Assessment for Field Service Questionnaire requires a separate subscription from the rest of the ServiceNow AI Platform.

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/store-release-notes/page/release-notes/store/sn-store-release-notes.html).

To purchase a subscription, contact your ServiceNow account manager. When you purchase a subscription, certain plugins are activated automatically. If a paid plugin isn't activated automatically, you can manually activate it from the All Applications list in your instance.
