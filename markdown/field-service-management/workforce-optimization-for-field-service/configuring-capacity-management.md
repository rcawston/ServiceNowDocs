# Configuring Field Service Capacity and Reservations Management

Configure Field Service Capacity and Reservations Management to manage the distribution and assignment of the work capacity for work order tasks.

## Configuration overview

The steps for configuring Field Service Capacity and Reservations Management are:

1.  [Activate Field Service Capacity and Reservations Management](capacity-management-plugin.md)

    You can activate the Field Service Capacity and Reservations Management plugin \(com.snc.fsm\_capacity\_management\) for Field Service Management if you have the admin role.

2.  [Activate Field Service Capacity console](capacity-console-plugin.md) to have the Capacity Console in the CSM/FSM Configurable workspace for capacity planners.
3.  [Capacity reservation rules](capacity-reservations.md#)

    Create capacity reservation rules to use in the capacity definition.

4.  [Create capacity allocation schedule](allocate-schedule-for-capaity-definition.md#)

    The capacity allocation schedule helps manage and distribute your resource capacity over a set period, ensuring that a certain percentage of your resources are reserved for high-priority or same-day tasks.

5.  [Create a capacity definition](create-capacity-definitions.md)

    Allocate work to different task attributes based on their reserved capacity percentage and defined source of capacity.

6.  [Create a demand channel](create-a-demand-channel.md)

    Demand channels help organize and manage work by efficiently distributing resources. When creating a reservation rule, you can allocate a specific percentage of capacity to a particular demand channel. By tagging work orders or tasks with demand channels, you ensure they’re routed correctly, improving resource allocation and scheduling accuracy.

7.  [Create a capacity assignment](assign-work-based-on-the-defined-capacity-.md)

    Create the assignment of work based on the selected source, such as agent schedules, tasks, or hours.

8.  [Create a capacity assignment override](override-capacity-assignment.md)

    Change the default capacity assignment rules for any change in plan within a capacity definition. You can update the capacity assignments for the existing capacity definition rule at different time intervals and for different capacity buckets rather than creating a new capacity definition.
