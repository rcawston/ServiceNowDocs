# Skill inputs for Now Assist for Field Service Management \(FSM\)

Use the inputs for each skill to configure how a skill is used.

## Skills Overview

Depending on the selected skill, you can configure inputs. These settings determine how a skill is used. An input identifies the data that is used for a skill, such as the table and fields used to generate a work order task summary.

You can use Now LLM Service, Now LLM Long Term Stable models \(LTS\), Azure OpenAI, Google Gemini or Anthropic Claude on AWS as the AI model provider for all Now Assist skills and AI agents. Use the Configuration Controls in [AI Control Tower](../../intelligent-experiences/ai-control-tower/ai-model-providers.md) to define which options are available, then set the skill-level preferences in the [Now Assist Admin console](../../intelligent-experiences/manage-large-language-models.md). For more information, see [Large language models on the ServiceNow AI Platform®](../../intelligent-experiences/servicenow-large-language-model-now-llm/exploring-large-language-models.md).
