You can view affected items, such as CIs, affected users, unmatched affected users, and affected services associated with a security incident.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_si.basic

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Security Incident Response Workspace**.

2.  Open the security incident for which you want to view affected items.

3.  Select the **Related Records** tab.

4.  Select **Business Impact**.

5.  Select any of the related lists to view or add information for the security incident.

</td></tr><tr><td>

</table>    **Note:** If the [Security Operations Integration - Get Running Processes](../get-running-processes-capability.md) integration capability is active, and you add a CI to a security incident, the [Get Running Processes](../secops-integration-get-running-processes-workflow.md) workflow runs and retrieves a list of running processes on the CI.

    If the [Security Operations Integration - Isolate Host](../isolate-host-capability.md) integration capability is active, you can select one or more CIs and restrict their system connections to other devices. To do this, select the check boxes for the CIs and select **Isolate Host** from the **Actions on selected rows** choice list.

6.  Selected any of the following related links to further update the security incident:

    -   [Show Related Items](show-related-items-for-si.md)
    -   [Show IoC](show-ioc-info-for-si.md)
    -   [Show Enrichment Data](show-enrich-data-for-si.md)
    -   [Show Response Tasks](show-response-tasks-for-si.md)
7.  When you have completed your entries, select **Save**.
