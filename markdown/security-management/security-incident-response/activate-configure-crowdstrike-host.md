# Get started with the CrowdStrike Falcon Host integration

The Integration Configuration feature allows you to quickly activate and set up third-party security integrations, including the CrowdStrike Falcon Host integration. Before you can use the CrowdStrike Falcon Host integration, you must download it from the ServiceNow Store and then add a user name and password.

## Before you begin

-   If you are upgrading CrowdStrike Falcon Host integration from a previous version, then you must delete the existing configuration and set up a new configuration. The new integration supports OAUTH2 authentication. This update requires you to enter the **API Client ID** and the **API Client Secret** to authenticate and complete the configuration.
-   In the CrowdStrike Falcon Host portal **API Scopes**, enable the **Read** and **Write** setting for **IOCs \(Indicators of Compromise\)**.

Role required: sn\_si\_admin

1.  [Download the integration from the ServiceNow Store](../download-app-first-time.md).

2.  When the installation is complete, navigate to **Security Operations** &gt; **Integrations** &gt; **Integration Configurations**.

    The available security integrations appear as a series of cards.

3.  In the CrowdStrike Falcon Host card, click **Configure**.
