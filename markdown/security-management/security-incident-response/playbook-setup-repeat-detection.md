# Set up the Repeat Detection playbook

Use the following steps to set up the Repeat Detection playbook.

## Before you begin

Role required:

-   sn\_si.admin
-   flow\_designer

Make sure you have installed Security Operations Spoke \(`sn_sec_spoke`\). You have an option to modify the following system properties:

-   `sn_sec_spoke.similarphish.earlyterminationscore`
-   `sn_sec_spoke.similarphish.lookbackdays`
-   `sn_sec_spoke.similarphish.maxcomparisonsize`
-   `sn_sec_spoke.similarphish.minmatchscore`

## Procedure

1.  Login as a user with sn\_si.user and flow\_designer roles.

2.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Flow Designer** and select the **Repeat Detection** playbook.

3.  You can create a copy of the Repeat Detection playbook flow and make the necessary modifications.

    To create a copy of the playbook's flow, click the ![More actions menu](../image/more-action-menu.png) icon and select **Copy flow**. Perform this step only if you plan to customize or make specific changes to the flow.

4.  Activate the playbooks.

    -   Activate the main flow to use the playbook available in the base system.
    -   Activate the copied flows after making the required changes.
5.  Set a **Trigger Condition** for the playbook.

    This playbook is triggered when the **Security Incident** **is not empty**.
