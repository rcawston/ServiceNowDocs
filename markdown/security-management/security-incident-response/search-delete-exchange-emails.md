# Search for and delete phishing emails

Deleting phishing emails can help reduce exposure to a specific attack across an organization. You can manage phishing emails on your email server by searching, granting approvals, and deleting them.

## About this task

This feature is used by the [Security Operations Integration - Email Search and Delete flow](../secops-integ-email-search-delete.md) to run a query against your email server.
