# Flow-based Playbooks

Using the Flow Designer, security administrators and flow design authors can more easily transition from manual or undocumented playbooks to automated and repeatable playbooks. The drag-and-drop feature provides flexibility in moving objects, condition checks, parallel branching, decision tables, and more.

Security Incident Response provides the following playbooks with the base system.

In addition to the listed playbooks, there are also subflows in Security Operations Spoke that can be called from the flows playbook. Ransomware is one of that subflows.

Activate these flows before you use them. For more information, see [Activate a Security Incident Response flow](getting-started-phishing-playbook.md).

-   **[Playbook for Automated Phishing](flow-designer-and-phishing-response.md)**

-   **[Playbook for Automated Malware](cj-sir-about-malware-flow.md)**  
The Automated Malware playbook provides a sequence of automated steps that helps you resolve malware alerts quickly and efficiently.
-   **[Playbook for Failed Login Manual](cj-sir-flow-library2.md)**  
When a user makes certain unsuccessful login attempts \(according to the SIM configuration\), a security incident is created.

Duplicate security incidents are categorized as child security incidents and are rolled up to the parent security incidents.

This playbook provides systematic remediation steps for investigating malicious files detected in Office 365.
-   **[Playbook for Repeat Detection](playbook-repeat-detection.md)**  
This playbook helps you determine if the incident response has been provided on an exact or similar phishing report in the past and automatically works on the new report similarly.
-   **[Playbook for Spoofed Emails \(using the same Display name\)](playbook-spoofed-emails-display-name.md)**  
This playbook provides systematic remediation steps to investigate Spoofed Emails, which get triggered when spoofed names for emails are sent to the organization's employees.

This playbook provides systematic remediation steps to investigate password spray alerts triggered by multiple failed logins \(too many authentication failures from more than one IP address for the same user\).

This playbook helps with the early stage triage of user-reported phishing submissions by alerting the analyst to the possibility of a look-alike domain in the Phisher's email address.
-   **[Playbook for Typo Squatted Domain](playbook-typo-squatted-domain.md)**  
This playbook provides systematic procedures for investigating misspelled domains and collaborating with the organization’s legal department for take-downs. Typo Squatted domains are intentionally misspelled domain names that closely resemble legitimate ones. Attackers take advantage of spelling errors to lead them to an ill-intended website for financial exploitation or other malicious activities.
-   **[Playbook for Credential Sniffing](playbook-credential-sniffing.md)**
