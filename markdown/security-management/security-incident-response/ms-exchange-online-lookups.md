# Microsoft Exchange Online integration

For the Microsoft Exchange Online integration application by ServiceNow, the ServiceNow AI Platform® Security Incident Response \(SIR\) product is integrated with the Microsoft Exchange Online service, one of the cloud-based services in the Microsoft Office 365 suite of products. Your Security Operation Center \(SOC\) analyst can search your corporate email environment for security-related threats and remove and remediate phishing emails with email search and delete capabilities.

## Overview of Microsoft Exchange Online integration

As the security incident analyst, you execute the integration from the security analyst interface, and the workflow returns email message details that match search criteria. Email searches are based on criteria that include subject lines as well as sender and recipient email addresses. After the email search is complete, you can delete suspicious emails from the Microsoft Exchange Online service, and, an optional approval process can be configured to request approval prior to deleting emails.

This email search and delete integration can be used with a broader phishing response incident workflow or runbook. After a corporate user or employee receives a suspicious email and reports it to the company's phishing response team or inbox, the reported email is forwarded to the ServiceNow AI Platform and categorized as a security incident. After you have verified that an email is a phishing attack, as the analyst responsible for investigating phishing incidents, you can initiate an email search to determine if other corporate users have received this phishing email. The search allows you to locate related emails from the same phishing campaign and identify other potential victims who may have received the email, read it, and also potentially clicked a malicious URL or opened an attachment.

## Key features

The integration includes the following key features:

-   Configure search criteria for phishing threats in Security Incident Response based on combinations of the sender, recipient, and subject fields on email messages.
-   For large and lengthy email searches, the security incident analyst is notified via email when the search has successfully completed, along with the number of matched messages.
-   Status for individual messages informs you if recipients have read or deleted suspicious emails.
-   If configured, optional approval processes ensure that suspicious emails are not deleted without prior approval.
-   A complete audit trail for delete requests that includes the number of deleted emails is logged in the work notes of security incidents.
-   If tagging is configured, security tags record when email search and delete workflows are initiated and successfully completed on security incidents.

## Supported Microsoft Exchange Online versions

This integration supports Microsoft Exchange Online services, which are part of the Microsoft Office 365 suite. The integration does not support hosted Microsoft Exchange environments. Microsoft runs Microsoft Exchange Online services on the Exchange 2016 version.
