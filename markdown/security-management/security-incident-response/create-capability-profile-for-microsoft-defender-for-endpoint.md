# Create a capability profile for the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint integration

Create a profile and select the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint capabilities that you want the profile to run.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_si.admin

## About this task

Profiles are created to club or group the capabilities together, which would help Analysts perform the investigation or remediation easily. You can add the following capabilities to the profile:

-   Get Host Details
-   Get Logged On Users
-   Isolate Host
-   Remove Isolation

You cannot club Isolate Host and Remove Host Isolation capabilities with other capabilities while creating a profile. Profiles for these capabilities have to be individually created. While on the other hand, the Get Host Details and Get Logged on Users capabilities can be clubbed together. You could create profiles individually or by clubbing them in full or parts as per your requirement.

**Note:** After a capability is included in a profile, it cannot be included in any other profile from the same source.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** &gt; **Capability Profiles**.

    The Microsoft Defender for Endpoint capability profiles list is displayed.
