Madrid and later release requirements

 For the Madrid release and later family releases, the Security Incident Response Dependency plugin \(com.snc.si\_dep\) is required. This plugin automatically installs all the dependencies that are required to support the Security Incident Response product. Install and activate this plugin before you install and activate the other Security Operations applications required by the integration.

 Verify that the following Security Operations applications are installed and activated from the ServiceNow Store. If not installed, install and activate one application at a time in the following order to ensure a smooth installation.

 1.  Security Incident Response
2.  Security Integration Framework
3.  Security Support Common
4.  Security Support Orchestration

 For more information on setting up your ServiceNow AI Platform instance for the integration, see [Get entitlement for a Security Operations product or application](../entitle-secops-product.md) and [Activate a ServiceNow Store application](../activate-entitled-store-app.md).
