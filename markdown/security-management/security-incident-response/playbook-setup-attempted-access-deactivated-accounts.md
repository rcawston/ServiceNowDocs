# Set up the Attempted Access Deactivated Account playbook

Use the following steps to set up the Attempted Access Deactivated Account playbook.

## Before you begin

Role required:

Make sure you have installed Security Operations Spoke \(`sn_sec_spoke`\).

## Procedure

1.  Login as a user with sn\_si.user and flow\_designer roles.

2.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Flow Designer** and select the **Attempted Access Deactivated Account** playbook.

3.  Create a copy of the Attempted Access Deactivated Account playbook flow and make the necessary modifications.

    To create a copy of the playbook's flow, select the ![More actions menu](../image/more-action-menu.png) icon and select **Copy flow**. Perform this step only if you plan to customize or make specific changes to the flow.

4.  Activate the playbooks.

    1.  Activate the main flow to use the playbook available in the base system.

    2.  Activate the copied flows after making the required changes.
