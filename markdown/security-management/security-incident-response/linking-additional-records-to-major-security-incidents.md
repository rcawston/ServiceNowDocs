# Link additional records to Major Security Incident

In the workspace, use the linking records functionality to link any related Security Incident records and its child security incidents, Remediation Tasks from Vulnerability Response, and Security Cases from Threat Intelligence to a Major Security Incident \(MSI\) record.

## Before you begin

2.  Navigate to the **Lists** view, which is displayed in the left pane of the workspace.

3.  Click **Accepted** to select the promoted major security incident records.

4.  Select the incident record that is required to be linked which is not in the Closed state from the list of promoted records.

5.  Click **Linked Records** tab.

    A drop-down list is provided to select other linked record tables.

    The Linked Records section displays the linked records and its related records, which were linked to the Major Security Incident.

6.  Select the desired table view such as Security Incidents, Remediation Tasks \(vulnerable items\), or Security Case from the list.

    Based on your selection type records table view, the linked records that linked to the major security incident records are displayed.

7.  Link a record that is not linked to any MSI record and is in the **Open** state by selecting the record and clicking **Link Record** in the top right of the page.
