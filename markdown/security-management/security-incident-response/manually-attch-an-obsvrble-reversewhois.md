# Initiate the lookup for Reverse Whois

Initiate domain lookups using search terms in observables that you manually attach to a security incident record.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_si.analyst

## Procedure

1.  If not open, navigate to **Security Incident** &gt; **Incidents** &gt; **Show All Incidents** and open the security incident you are working with.

2.  At the bottom of the record, click the **Show IoC** related link to display the Observables tab.

    **Note:** The figures in the following steps are shown with the **Tabbed forms** setting active in the System Settings. If you do not see tabs on the security incident, in the upper-right corner of the banner frame, click the **Settings** gear icon. In the **System Settings** dialog box that is displayed, click **Forms** and verify that **Tabbed forms** and **With the Form** are selected.
