# Create a capability profile

Create a profile and select the CrowdStrike Falcon Insight capabilities that you want the profile to run.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_si.admin

## About this task

Consider why you want to create a profile before you add CrowdStrike Falcon Insight capabilities to it. The following table lists the capabilities that you must add to a profile when you want the profile to perform certain queries or actions.

You can create a single profile that runs queries for Host details, lists logged-in users, fetches running services, fetches running processes, fetches network statistics, isolates the host, and removes the isolated host. Alternatively, you can create multiple profiles, each with its own single capability.

**Note:** Isolate host, remove isolation, and get file capabilities cannot be merged with any other capabilities while creating a profile.
