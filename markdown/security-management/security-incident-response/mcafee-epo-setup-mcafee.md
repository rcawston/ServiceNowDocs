# Set up your McAfee ePO console to integrate with Security Incident Response \(SIR\)

The following section lists the setup steps that you are required to complete in your McAfee ePO console prior to installing the application from the ServiceNow Store for the integration.

## Before you begin

Role required: McAfee ePO administrator

As a user with the McAfee ePO administrator permission, verify that you have installed the `Servicenow.zip` extension plugin in your McAfee ePO console. This extension plugin is required for the integration. For more information and to obtain the plugin, in your ServiceNow AI Platform instance, navigate to **Knowledge** &gt; **Articles** &gt; **All**. In the Search field, enter, ServiceNow Security Operations Extension for McAfee ePO.

## About this task

The ServiceNow extension plugin connects your ServiceNow AI Platform instance to your McAfee ePO console. This connection allows you to reference the security tags you that create in your McAfee ePO console for the isolate host and initiate malware scan actions to the capability profiles in your ServiceNow AI Platform instance.

The security tags in your McAfee ePO console must match the security tags in the capability records in your ServiceNow AI Platform instance.

The following steps show you how to install the extension plugin, create a security tag in your McAfee ePO console, and assign an action to the tag. For more information about the security tags in the McAfee ePO console, see the [McAfee Product Documentation](https://docs.mcafee.com/bundle?value=225) website.

**Note:** The figures in the following section are from the McAfee ePO console.
