# Security Incident Details section

This section displays the security incident form fields that are rendered from the security incident classic UI.

The Classic UI has a view called **SIRW** View created. This view is mapped to the **Details** tab in the workspace. Any customizations that are required need to be implemented in this view.

The form fields are grouped into the following sections and displayed on the Details tab form view. Select any of the section or jump to the respective section within the form:

-   Security Incident
-   Priority
-   Source
-   Parent
-   Assignment
-   Access Controls
-   Affected Items
-   Restriction
-   Resolution

The **Details** tab contains the **Activity** stream section within the details form itself for a quick access to the security analysts to add any comments and post it. Additionally, you can also use the **Email** option, to send email about this security incident to the necessary stakeholders.
