# Microsoft Defender integration for Security Operations

The Microsoft Defender integration for ServiceNow Security Operations ingests alerts and incidents into the ServiceNow Security Incident Response \(SIR\) platform for centralized case management. Bi-directional synchronization keeps status and work notes aligned across both platforms, ensuring teams working in either system maintain consistent information without discrepancies.

**Important:**

Microsoft has extended the deprecation of the Azure Sentinel experience in the Azure portal from March 2026 to March 2027.

If you are currently using the Azure Sentinel integration with Security Incident Response \(SIR\), migrate to the new Defender portal integration as soon as possible. The Defender integration built-in migration utility automatically converts your existing Sentinel profiles to Defender profiles, while ensuring continuity of incidents created through Sentinel after the transition. For more information, see [Microsoft Sentinel to Defender Migration Guide](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2795226).
