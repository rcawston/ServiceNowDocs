# Use certificates for authentication

Request an access token with a certificate credential.

## Before you begin

1.  You can either use a self-signed certificate or CA issued certificate. You can create a self-signed certificate by executing the PowerShell script as outlined in [Setting up an Azure AD app for app-only access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/security-apponly-azuread#setting-up-an-azure-ad-app-for-app-only-access). The script generates two files: .PFX file and .CER file.

    **Note:** Ensure that you are aware of the password that is used to encrypt private key to generate the .PFX file and .CER file.

2.  Use the .PFX file to create a Java Key Store \(JKS\) file.

    **Note:** Ensure that you are aware of the password that is used to generate JKS file from the .PFX file.


Role required: admin

1.  Navigate to **App registrations** in Azure AD portal.

2.  Click **Certificates &amp; secrets** from the **Manage** section.

3.  In the **Certificates** tab, click **Upload Certificate**.

    |Description|Description of the certificate.|

5.  Click **Add**.

    The certificate is uploaded and its details are displayed under the **Certificates** tab.

6.  Copy the **Thumbprint** value of the uploaded certificate.

    **Note:** The **Thumbprint** value is a hexadecimal value.

7.  Encode the **Thumbprint** value to a Base64 value and record the value for later use.

    **Note:** You can use a Hexadecimal to Base64 \(Hex to Base64\) converter tool to encode the **Thumbprint** value to a Base64 value.
