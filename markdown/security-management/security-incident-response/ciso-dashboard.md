## CISO dashboard indicators

The CISO dashboard presents the following key performance indicators:

-   **SI - Average Time to Identify**

    A 7-day average of the time in minutes it takes to identify a security incident, calculated daily.

-   **Average Time to Contain**

    A 7-day average of the time in minutes it takes to contain a security incident, calculated daily.

-   **Average Time to Eradicate**

    A 7-day average of the time in minutes it takes to eradicate a security incident, calculated daily. Both Average Time to Contain and Average Time to Eradicate are based on the indicator SI - Average Duration Time broken down by Security Incident State.

-   **New Security Incidents This Week**

    The weekly sum of the score of the daily Number of new security incidents indicator.

-   **Security Incidents Closed \(weekly\)**

    The 7-day running sum of the daily Number of closed security incidents indicator.

-   **New Security Incidents by Priority**

    Daily breakdown of the Number of new security incidents indicator by Priority.

-   **New vs Closed Security Incidents \(weekly\) volume**

    The 7-day running sum time series of the Number of new incidents indicator charted against the 7-day running sum time series of the Number of closed incidents indicator.

-   **Security Incident Heatmap**

    A global map showing the number of open security incidents in each country.

-   **Security Incident Treemap**

    An interactive treemap where you can select to see:

    -   Security incidents per business service, broken down by business criticality
    -   Security incidents broken down by category or subcategory of incident
    -   Security incidents per assignment group or per assignee
    -   'Victim stats' of security incident per affected resource or affected user

## Breakdowns

The following breakdowns apply to the indicators on the dashboard:

-   Business criticality
-   Security Group
-   Security Incident Age
-   Security Incident Category
-   Security Incident Close Code
-   Security Incident Priority
-   Security Incident State
-   SI - Business Service
-   Vulnerability
