# Manage Shift Handover records

Use the Shift Handover records list view to create, edit, copy, or delete Shift Handover records. Each Shift Handover record is associated with a Shift Handover Report Template.

## Before you begin

Role required:

-   sn\_escm\_sh.shift\_analyst: Minimum requirement to access the Shift Handover records.
-   sn\_escm\_sh.shift\_owner: Create, edit, and delete handover log records in the user groups the Shift Owner is part of. This role inherits the sn\_escm\_sh.shift\_analyst role.
-   sn\_escm\_sh.shift\_analyst: View all the Shift Handover log records but can contribute only to In-progress Shift Handover records assigned to the Shift Analyst's group.
-   sn\_si.analyst - Inherits the sn\_escm\_sh.shift\_analyst role.
-   sn\_si.admin - Inherits the sn\_escm\_sh.shift\_admin role.
-   sn\_escm\_sh.shift\_admin - Inherits the sn\_escm\_sh.shift\_owner role

**Important:** To learn how to configure the Shift Handover Template as an Admin, see [Configure Shift Handover Templates](configure-shift-handover-templates.md).

## About this task

The Shift Owner and the respective team or user group create the Shift Handover log records. The Shift Owner has to choose the Shift Handover template and user group that will work on the Shift Handover report. After the Shift Handover report is complete, it will be shared with the next active Shift Owner and team.

Shift Handover template key points:

-   If some other analyst from the active shift team has already updated the report before you, and if changes are being processed, then you might see an error message that there are pending content updates. You must wait 30 seconds and then select **Change to "Review" state** again. You can see the consolidated report on the right-pane get updated with other analysts' updated content.
-   If the Shift owner has modified the content in a section in the Review state, then the same content gets reflected for the Analyst when the record moves back to the In-progress state.
-   The Shift owner must be mindful while editing the content in the Review state, and performing actions like merging two lines, merging two sections, removing a section, as this will affect the Shift Handover report of the other analysts.
-   After publishing the Shift Handover report, the Shift owner can modify the content, but they can’t change the record state.
-   When someone is modifying the content and during that time, if the record state gets changed from In-progress to Review, then the unsaved content changes get discarded.
-   Shift admin will have write access to all shift handover log records irrespective of user groups.
