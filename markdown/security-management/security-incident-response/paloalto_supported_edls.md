# Supported External Dynamic Lists for Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewall

The ServiceNow Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewall integration supports External Dynamic Lists \(EDLs\) that accept IP, URL, and domain observables.

## Supported EDLs and observables

An External Dynamic List is a text file that is hosted on an external web server, which for this integration is the ServiceNow AI Platform instance. The Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewall can then import objects — IP addresses, URLs, domains — included in the list and enforce policy. To enforce policy on the EDL entries, the list is referenced in a policy rule or profile.

This integration supports three types of EDLs:

-   IP \(This includes a single IP Address, as well as CIDR blocks \(ranges\) of addresses\).
-   URL
-   Domain

The following table lists descriptions of the observables supported by this integration and example formats for each type.

-   95.153.103.54 \(IPv4\)
-   \(IPv6\): 2001:00B8:130F:FE03:0000:09C0:080F:130B

</td><td>

Represents a single, distinct interface address.The integration supports IPv4, IPv6, and CIDR formats.

 Support for IP address observables includes CIDR \(Classless Inter-Domain Routing\) ranges, for example, 95.153.100.0/22.

 Note: An error message is displayed when you try to attach a single IP address to an EDL that you have already blocked as a part of a CIDR range. For example, the single address 95.153.103.54 is part of the CIDR range represented by 95.153.100.0/22 \(95.153.100.0-95.153.103.255\).
