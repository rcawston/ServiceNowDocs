In the post incident review assignment rule shown here, when a security incident with the **Category** field set to **Malicious code activity** transitions to the **Review** state, the three users identified \(who happen to be experts in dealing with malicious code activity\) are added to the list of users who receive the post incident review questionnaire for this security incident.
