# Create a chat channel template

Configure Chat Teams and Channel Templates to create chat teams and channels to collaborate, track the chat conversations, and add users and user groups to those Chat Channels. These Channel templates are created in the Microsoft Teams when a major security incident is promoted.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_msi.workspace\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Major Security Incident Management** &gt; **Chat Channel** &gt; **Channel Templates**.

2.  On the Chat Channel Configuration form, select **New** in the form header.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_v4k_lbn_drb"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

Name of the folder.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Provider

</td><td>

Microsoft Teams.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Team Name

</td><td>

Name for the team, for example in the format, \{number\}-\{category\}.**Note:** The team name provided here will be used across all Major Security Incident records. To ensure that the actual Microsoft Team Name is displayed in MS Teams application and has a unique name value for different Major Security Incidents, it is recommended that you use an incident field value which is unique such as the incident number - \{number\}. As shown in the screen shot example, the \{number\} followed by a separator '-' and the \{category\} field variable would provide a unique number and description of the major security incident that Microsoft Teams is created for, for example \{number\} - \{category\}.
