# Create an observable for manual WHOISIQ lookups

Security incident analysts use information from observable enrichment with the WHOISIQ API to learn more about the email addresses, names, and phone numbers of organizations.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_si.analyst

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **IoC Repository** &gt; **Observables**.

    ![Enter Observables in the navigation panel.](../image/riskiq-obs-enter.png "Enter Observables in navigation filter")

    Under the navigation panel, the Observables module is displayed.

3.  Click **New** to create a new observable.

4.  On Observable form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |**Value**|Email address, organization name, phone number, or mailing address. For example, `test1gmail.com`|
    |**Observable type**|The field is automatically cleared.|
    |**Finding**|The field is automatically set to **Unknown**.|

    ![Enter a value in the field.](../image/riskiq-testmail-new.png "Create a new observable")

5.  Click **Submit**.

    You are returned to the Observables list. In the **Value** column, your new observable is displayed.

    **Note:** If you cannot locate your observable on the part of the list that is displayed, use the search functionality to find it.

6.  Edit the **Observable type** field to change the type from **Unknown** to **Email address** to match your observable.

    1.  In the **Observable type** column, single-click to the right of the **Unknown** text to select it.

        ![Click off of the text and in the column to select the field.](../image/riskiq-test1email-unknown.png "Select the Observable type field")

        The selected field is outlined in blue.

    2.  With the field outlined in blue, double-click anywhere inside the highlighted field to open the editor.

    3.  In the field that is displayed, enter the observable type \(`Email address`\) and click the green check mark to save the value.

        ![Enter the observable type in the editor and click the green check to save it.](../image/riskiq-test1email-edit.png "Edit the Observable type field")

        In the **Observable type** column on the list, `Email Address` is displayed for your new observable.
