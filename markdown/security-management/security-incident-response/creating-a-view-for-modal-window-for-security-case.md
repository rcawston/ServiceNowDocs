# Step 2. Create a view for modal window for a Security Case

Create a view for modal window for a Security Case.

## Before you begin

**Key Consideration:**

-   By default, the linked record modal list will only be showing the **Default** list layout. If you want to customize the list layout, you can do so using **Custom View** on the Source Table.
-   If you want to render the custom view, the custom view should also be selected in the Linked Record Configuration for Source Table.

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Go to the source table and select **Configure** &gt; **List Layout**.

2.  Go to **List view** &gt; **View name**.

3.  Select **New** in the View name drop-down list and create view, for example, msim\_sn\_ti\_case\_modal\_view.

4.  Select the newly created view.

    Once selected, you can choose the required fields from the Available list.

5.  Select **Save**.

6.  Navigate to **Menu** &gt; **Views** to verify if the view has rendered properly.
