# Register new Security Operations applications for on-demand orchestration

In the base system, Security Operations applications are automatically registered when they are activated. Registration allows the workflows associated with the applications to be available for on-demand orchestration requests. If needed, you can define new applications and associate workflows with them for on-demand orchestration.

    **Note:** The options that display depend on the applications you have activated. For detailed information on creating new applications, see [Building applications](../../application-development/build-applications.md).

4.  After the application has been generated, you can create scripts for setting up on-demand orchestration.

    **Note:** Setting up on-demand orchestration for new applications requires advanced technical knowledge of scripting and creating triggers for the scripts \(business rules, UI action, workflows, and so on\). For more information, contact ServiceNow Professional Services.
