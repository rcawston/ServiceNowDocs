# Configure Major Security Incident status reports

Configure major security incident reports to set up and download the reports according to your business needs throughout the life cycle of the major security incident record remediation process.

You can build the report templates with a specific format and layout, and customize these reports according to your specific requirements using the Status Reports feature of the Major Security Incident Management workspace.

A user with the sn\_msi.workspace\_manager role can create and configure the report templates that outline the type of report information that can be used to generate all the status reports, which can be shared with specific users such as executive stakeholders, legal departments and map those templates to the major security incident records.

To customize your MSI status reports, you must first set up the report templates using **Report Templates**. With the help of Report Templates, you can build the report template types, define the report components for those report templates, add additional information, create visualized data to track the scope and progress metrics, add related list data, and generate the status reports.

The following describes the default fields provided in all the report template types. You can configure and format the report template based on your requirements using sections, subsections, and its elements:

|Component Type|Description|
|--------------|-----------|
|Report Title|Title of the report type. For example, the default format of the report type is: \{MSI Number\} - \{Executive Stakeholder Report\} depicted as MSI0001001: Executive Stakeholder Report.|
|Name|Displays the name of the user who generated the report using the Status Reports section of the Major Security Incident Management workspace.|
|Summary|Displays a brief summary of the report.|
|Date|Displays the date on which the report is shared with the concerned recipient.|
|Progress|Displays the Scope and Progress Metrics such as the linked SIR Incidents, Response Tasks, Supplementary Tasks, External Collaboration, Timeline components, and Recent Timeline Events.|
|Challenges|This section displays a brief description on the challenges involved throughout the major security incident remediation process.|
|Next Steps|This section displays a brief description on the next steps involved in resolving the major security incident. For example, the active team subsection in the executive stakeholder report provides you with the information with the next step on the team assignment who is involved in further analysis of the major security incident record.|
|Other customizations|The report template also provides you with the capability to upload the logo and customize the headers and footers on the report.|

Following are the types of report categories that can be set up and viewed:

-   **Executive** Email
-   **Technical Status Report** PDF
-   **Executive Status Report** PDF

The above reports are configured and available for the user to select, view, and generate the report from the Major Security Incident Management workspace.
