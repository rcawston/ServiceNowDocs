However, the source that you configure on the Event Ingestions Configuration form can be reused for multiple ServiceNow AI Platform® profiles as long as each profile ingests unique Splunk triggered alerts.

If an error message is displayed after you click **Submit**, enter your information again and click **Submit**.

## What to do next
