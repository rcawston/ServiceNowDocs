Description

Verify that you have assigned the required ServiceNow AI Platform and Security Incident Response roles.

</td><td>

The following roles are required for installation, configuration, and verification of expected results:-   The administrator \(admin\) installs the app and assigns the Security Incident Administrator \(sn\_si.admin\) role.
-   The Security Incident Administrator \(sn\_si.admin\) oversees the configuration and verifies the expected results. This role also has access to the Security Operations module and assigns the sn\_si.analyst role.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Obtain an API key.

</td><td>

Visit the Hybrid Analysis website for information on API keys and to create an account: [Hybrid Analysis website](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/). The configuration requires that you enter the API keys.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Verify that the ServiceNow core applications that are required to support the integration are installed and activated before you install the application for the integration.

</td><td>

For the Madrid release and later family releases, the com.snc.si\_dep plugin is required. This plugin automatically installs all the dependencies that are required to support the Security Incident Response product. Install and activate this plugin before installing and activating the other Security Operations applications.

 The following Security Operations applications must be installed and activated from the ServiceNow Store. Install and then activate one application at a time in the order listed below to ensure a smooth installation:

1.  Security Integration Framework
2.  Security Support Common
3.  Security Support Orchestration
4.  Security Incident Response

 For more information on setting up your ServiceNow AI Platform instance for the integration, see [Get entitlement for a Security Operations product or application](../entitle-secops-product.md) and [Activate a ServiceNow Store application](../activate-entitled-store-app.md).
