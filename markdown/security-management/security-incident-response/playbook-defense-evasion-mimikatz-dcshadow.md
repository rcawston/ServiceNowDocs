# Playbook for T1003 - Defense Evasion - Mimikatz DCShadow

This playbook provides systematic remediation steps to investigate incidents suspected to be caused by Mimikatz DCShadow. DCShadow is a feature in Mimikatz that simulates the behavior of a Domain Controller \(a server controlling Active Directory\) to inject its own data, bypassing most of the standard security controls \(including SIEMs\).

Mimikatz DCShadow helps the attacker establish a rogue Domain Controller \(DC\) that becomes part of the Active Directory \(AD\). Once registered, it can act as a legitimate DC and cause damage.
