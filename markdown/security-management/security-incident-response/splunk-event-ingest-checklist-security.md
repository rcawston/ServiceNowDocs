## Before you begin

Roles required: sn\_si.ingestion\_profile\_admin, admin, sn\_si.admin, sn\_si.analyst, Splunk Enterprise Security administrator

Each row of the table lists tasks and identifies the roles that are required to perform the tasks. Numbered topics of the installation and configuration guide are also referenced.

Roles required for each task are listed with each step in the following table.

## Procedure
