Add Access Control Lists \(ACLs\) for Major Security Incident Management workspace users.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

**Note:** The permissions required to linking and unlinking capabilities are controlled by the sn\_msi.linkedsivi\_read role.

1.  sn\_msi.workspace\_admin \(MSIM Workspace admin\)
2.  sn\_msi.workspace\_manager \(MSIM Workspace manager\)
3.  sn\_msi.workspace\_responder \(MSIM Workspace responder\)

**Note:** For any source table, you must make sure that the required roles are added to the sn\_msi.linkedsivi\_read role.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **User Administration** &gt; **Roles** and search for **sn\_msi.linkedsivi\_read** role.

2.  Select **Edit** in the Contains Roles related list section.
