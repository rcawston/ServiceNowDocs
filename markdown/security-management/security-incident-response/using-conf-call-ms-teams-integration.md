# Use the MSIM Conference Call Microsoft Teams integration

The following steps give you a walkthrough of how you can manage and initiate a Microsoft Teams conference call directly from a major security incident.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_msi.workspace\_manager

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Major Security Incident Management**.

2.  From the Major Security Incident list, select a major security incident.

3.  Select the **Start a conference call** action.

4.  You can also start a conference call by selecting the ![Conference call](../image/msim-conf-call-icon.png) icon on the right-context menu and selecting the + icon.

    The Start conference call pop-up appears.

5.  Choose **Microsoft Teams** as the conference bridge that you want to connect from.

6.  In the Title field, provide a title that describes the reason for the Microsoft Teams conference call.

7.  In the Add participants field, select the participants for the Microsoft Teams conference call.

    You can use the search option to find and add the required participants or select the participants from the **Recommendations** list, which provides participant recommendations to add to the Microsoft Teams conference call.

    The user \(host\) who initiates the Microsoft Teams conference call is automatically added to the list of selected participants. All the users associated with the major security incident are available by default under the **Recommendations** list.

    **Note:** Make sure the participants that you select have a valid email address.

8.  After selecting the participants, provide a brief description of the reason for starting the conference call in the Description field.

    The description that you provide will be added to the conference record.

9.  After the participant list is finalized, select **Start**.

    The conference call starts in the Microsoft Teams app. All the participants are notified through an email from the MSIM app and the other notification is sent through a bot on the Microsoft Teams app.

10. Select the **Click here** option on top of the major security incident to join the conference call on the Microsoft Teams app.

    The participants can use the link from the MSIM email notification or the notification from the Microsoft Teams app to join the call.

11. Open the associated major security incident in the MSIM workspace to view the conference call details.

    When the final participant leaves the call, the conference call ends or select **End call** in the Conference call section to end the conference call.
