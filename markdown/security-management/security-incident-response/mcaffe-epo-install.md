# Install the application and configure a server for the McAfee ePO integration

Before you invoke the workflows for the integration, install and configure the McAfee ePO application from the ServiceNow Store on your ServiceNow AI Platform instance. The configuration is required to connect to the McAfee ePO console.

## Before you begin

Role required: ServiceNow AI Platform administrator \(admin\)

## About this task

The integration supports multiple servers, however, to avoid conflicts in profiles that share the same triggering conditions, you cannot share a McAfee ePO capability with multiple profiles that use the same McAfee ePO server. For example, as shown in the following figure, you can have capability 1 in more than one profile as long as each McAfee ePO server is mapped to a unique profile that has capability 1.

2.  Navigate to **Security Operations** &gt; **Integrations** &gt; **Integration Configurations**.
