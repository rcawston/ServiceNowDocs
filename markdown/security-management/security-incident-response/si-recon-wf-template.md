# Security Incident Reconnaissance workflow template

Reconnaissance is usually a preliminary step toward a further attack seeking to exploit a device or system. The Security Incident - Reconnaissance - Template allows you to perform a series of tasks designed to handle reconnaissance on your network.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_si.write

## About this task

The workflow is triggered when the **Category** in a security incident is set to **Reconnaissance activity**. This action causes a response task to be created for the first activity in the workflow.

2.  In **Category**, select **Reconnaissance activity**.

3.  Save the record.

4.  Scroll down and open the **Response Tasks** related list.
