    ![Open incidents](../image/show-incidents.png)

2.  Select any incident record.

3.  Right click on the incident context menu.

4.  Go to **Configure** &gt; **Related List**.

    The **Configuring related lists on Security Incident form** is displayed.

5.  Go to **View name** and select **New**.

6.  Enter a name for the view.

7.  Select the newly created view.

12. Add the newly created view name separated by a comma to an already existing list of values in the **Value** text box under the **sn\_si\_incident.viewsUsedForGrouping** field.

    For example, if you had created a new view name as, **Business Impact** then in the **Value** text box you must specify it as **business\_impact** \(which is separated by underscore within the view name and separated by a comma after an existing value\) under the sn\_si\_incident:groups field.

    ![Related List Layout configuration.](../image/value-text-box-related-list.png)

    **Note:** If you add the new view name under **sn\_si\_incident.viewsUsedForGrouping** field then the entry will be created in the **Related Records** tab of the workspace.

    If you update the view name entry in **si\_other\_records.viewsUsedForGrouping** then the related list group will get added in the **Other Records** tab of the workspace.

    Below is an example view which shows the newly created views added.

    ![related list newly created view](../image/related-list-new-view-page.png)

    **Note:** **requiredRolesForGrouping** contains comma separated sys\_user\_role record names. SIR Workspace user should have at least one of these roles, to use the grouped related lists. When a user does not have any of these roles then related lists view configured for the current user role using view rule configuration will be represented vertically without grouping. This property is ignored when **isGrouped** property is set to false. If this property is empty any user can access the grouped related lists.
