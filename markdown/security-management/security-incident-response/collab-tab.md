# Track collaboration activity via MSIM workspace

Track chat and file activities related to resolving major security incidents through the MSIM Workspace.

Activities are coordinated using Microsoft Teams chat and Microsoft SharePoint files and folders and then posted back to the Major Security Incident via integrations.

Once Microsoft Teams and Microsoft SharePoint are integrated with Major Security Incident Management, you can use the MSIM Workspace to track collaboration between incident response users and other groups who are contributing to the resolution of a major security incident. Any updates to collaboration folders and files in Microsoft SharePoint are synchronized with the MSIM Workspace File Explorer and also reflected in the Activity stream components.

When a security incident is promoted as major security incident:

1.  A folder structure will be created in Microsoft SharePoint based on the folder template configuration. The same folder structure will be reflected on the File Explorer component of the workspace.
2.  A team with multiple channels is created under Microsoft Teams application and the same will be reflected on the Chat Management component of the workspace.

Role required: sn\_msi.workspace\_manager.

You can rename, move, or delete these files and folders as required.

Also, whenever you upload a file to any of the folders, the activity corresponding to those folders will be automatically associated to the File Explorer folders in the Collaboration tab and the activity will be recorded and displayed in the Activity section of the Major Security Incident Management Workspace.
