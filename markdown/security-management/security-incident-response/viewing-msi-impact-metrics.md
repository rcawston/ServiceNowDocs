# View Major Security Incident trend charts

View the major security incident impact progress metrics visualized as bar graphs and charts.

In addition to the incident timeline and progress trend chart visualizations, the **Overview** tab provides relevant impact metrics to manage the changing scope of the incident, including rollup of affected assets, users, locations, and team resources.

The counts displayed in the visualization components are based on active tasks on linked Security Incident Response \(SIR\) incidents. As tasks are opened and closed, these counts change in terms of the nature and volume of remaining activity planned for the major security incident to represent the trends shown in the trend chart visualization components.
