# Configure the Check Point Anti-bot - Email Parser integration

The Check Point Anti-bot - Email Parser integration uses email notifications to drive enrichment, and response workflows.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_si\_admin

## About this task

A Check Point Anti-bot email parser template is provided to use for the integration. It must be configured and activated before the integration takes place. Updating the parser activates it.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Security Operations** &gt; **Integrations** &gt; **Integration Configurations**.

    The available security integrations appear as a series of cards.

5.  Check the **Active** box.

6.  Click **Update** in the **Email Parser** form.

    The email parser is active. You do not need to return to **Integration Configurations**.
