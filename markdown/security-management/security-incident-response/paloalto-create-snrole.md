# Create the API account role for Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewall

An API account role is required in your ServiceNow AI Platform® instance for this integration. The Username and Password associated with this account are created in the ServiceNow AI Platform® and entered in Palo Alto Networks so the Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewall authenticates with the ServiceNow AI Platform® when retrieving EDL entries.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

The ServiceNow AI Platform® admin creates an API account role \(sn\_sec\_panfw.api\_account\_access\). This account is used exclusively for entering credentials required for authentication on Palo Alto Networks so the firewalls can retrieve EDLs from the ServiceNow AI Platform®. This account is a separate, unique API user account in the ServiceNow AI Platform® instance, and assigned to the Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewall administrator.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Organization** &gt; **Users**.

2.  Click the **Users** module.
