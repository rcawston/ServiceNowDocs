# Recover deleted emails on the Microsoft Exchange Online service

\(Optional\) As a Microsoft Exchange Administrator, you can recover deleted emails if your incident remediation requires that you to recover the emails deleted by the workflow of this integration.

## Before you begin

For more information about how this integration deletes emails, see [Configure the Microsoft Exchange Online integration](msx_configure.md).

For more information about the administrative role in the Microsoft Office 365 product, including information about recovering deleted items in a user mailbox, see [About the Exchange Online admin role](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/about-the-exchange-online-admin-role-097ae285-c4af-4319-9770-e2559d66e4c8).

Role required: admin, Microsoft Exchange Administrator

## About this task

If you select the **Recover Deleted Emails** option in the Additional Settings tab during the configuration step, you enable the recovery of deleted emails in your Microsoft Exchange Online tenant. Emails deleted using the delete workflow of this integration are placed in the Deleted Items sub folder of the Recoverable items folder in the mailbox of the user on the Microsoft Exchange Online service. If the user's account is configured in Microsoft Exchange Online tenant so that the user can view the Deleted Items folder, the user can recover these emails by using the Microsoft Outlook service on the web. Alternatively, the Microsoft Exchange Online administrator can recover deleted emails from a Deleted Items folder of a user.
