# LogRhythm Overview

The mapping flexibility of this integration provides an analyst with visibility to events and related alarm data that can be integrated into ServiceNow AI Platform security incidents for further investigation and remediation.

Alarm profiles are created in your ServiceNow AI Platform instance to customize how different LogRhythm alarm fields are displayed on a ServiceNow AI Platform security incident. A default mapping of alarm fields is provided, which can be edited to meet customer-specific needs.

The following figure is an example of a customer environment. When an event triggers the creation of a security incident in the ServiceNow AI Platform® instance, a request is sent from your ServiceNow AI Platform® instance to pull alarms from the LogRhythm Client Console either through a MID Server or even without it.

The REST API key is used by the ServiceNow AI Platform® to authenticate with the LogRhythm Client Console. This connection allows your ServiceNow AI Platform instance to pull individual LogRhythm alarms based on configured profiles.

The REST API is used to gather message details not accessed by the REST API.
