5.  In the Conference bridge field, choose a **Conference bridge** that you want to connect from.

    For example, Microsoft Team, Zoom, or Cisco Webex.

6.  In the Title field, provide a title that describes the reason for the conference call.

7.  In the Add participants field, select the participants for the conference call.

    You can use the search option to find and add the required participants or select the participants from the **Recommendations** list, which provides participant recommendations to add to the conference call.

    The user \(host\) who initiates the conference call is automatically added to the list of selected participants. All the users associated with the major security incident are available by default under the **Recommendations** list.

    **Note:** Make sure the participants that you select have a valid email address.

8.  After selecting the participants, provide a brief description of the reason for starting the conference call in the Description field.

    The description that you provide will be added to the conference record.

9.  After the participant list is finalized, select **Start**.

    The conference call starts in the selected conference bridge. All the participants are notified through email, and they're also notified through the respective conference bridge that was selected.

10. Select the **Click here** option on top of the major security incident to join the conference call.

    The participants can use the link from the email notification or the notification from the selected conference bridge to join the call.

11. Open the associated major security incident to view the conference call details.

    When the final participant leaves the conference, the conference call ends or select **End call** to end the conference call.
