# Run procdump flow

The **Run procdump** flow runs a process dump on a specified process and saves it to a file that can be targeted by security analysts.

Role required: sn\_si.analyst

This flow is triggered when enriched processes are selected and a **Run procdump** UI action is executed.

Reasons the procdump can fail includes:

-   Invalid dump path
-   Invalid file share path
-   Unable to fetch the fully-qualified domin name of the Windows machine the procdump is running on
-   The process name is not specified
-   The PROCDUMP environment variable not found
-   A copy of the dump file fails to copy from the dump path to the file share path

-   **[Execute procdump action](execute_procdump.md)**  
**Execute procdump** is a powershell action that runs the procdump on the selected processes, dumps the data into a file, and posts it to a shared site on an internal network. An analyst can then view a deny listed process, highlighted in red in a security incident, and perform additional analysis on the file.
