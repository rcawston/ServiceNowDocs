# Other additional Security Incident Response setup tasks

If you are an administrator in the global domain, you configure how Security Incident Response handles day-to-day operations.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_si.admin

**Note:**

These options are standard to many service management applications, and as such, they use service management terminology. For example, Request is used for the main task \(that is, the security incident\) and Task is used for subtasks or Response Tasks.

If you are an administrator in a domain lower than the global domain, you can view the Configurations screen, but cannot modify the settings.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Security Incident** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Configuration**.

    The options for configuring the applications are organized under these tabs:

    -   The **Business Process** tab contains options for setting up the request life cycle, creating catalogs and requests, and configuring notifications.
    -   The **Assignment** tab contains options for setting up manual and auto-assignment.
    -   The **Add-ons** tab contains options for enabling the knowledge base, managed documents, and task activities.
2.  Fill in the fields on the **Business process** tab.

You can configure notifications to be sent to specific recipients when selected fields in security incidents and response tasks change. 1.  From **Table**, select **Request \(security incident** or **Task \(response task\)**.
2.  From **Field**, select the field to use for generating notifications. When a change is made to the selected field, a notification is sent to the identified recipients.
3.  From **Recipients**, select one or more recipients.
4.  If you select **a specific user** or **a specific group**, you are prompted to select a user or group.
5.  To define more notifications using other fields or recipients, repeat the preceding steps for the next set of notification settings.
6.  To remove a notification, select the ![delete notification symbol](../../threat-intelligence/image/DeleteNotification.png) icon to the right of the notification.

## Lock down security administration

To protect investigations and keep security incidents private, you can restrict Security Incident Response access to security-specific roles and ACLs. Non-security administrators can be restricted from access, unless you expressly allow them entry.

### Before you begin

When the Security Incident Response application is activated, the System Administrator user is granted the sn\_si.admin role by default. The System Administrator is the only administrator who can set up security groups and users.

A security role is required to have access to Security Incident Response features and records.

Role required: sn\_si.admin

### Procedure

1.  After the Security Incident Response plugin has been activated, a user with the admin role assigns the Scoped Admin \(sn\_si.admin\) role to at least one user.

2.  The user with the admin role changes to the Security Incident scope.

3.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **sys\_store\_app.list**.

4.  Type **sn\_si** in the **Scope** field.

    ![System applications.](../image/system-applications.png)

5.  Click **Security Incident Response**.

6.  Scroll down to the **Related Links** and click **Remove from the role contained by admin**.

7.  Log out and log back in.

    The admin user cannot access the Security Incident Response application.

## Manage Restricted Caller Access

The Restricted Caller Access \(RCA\) feature enables an administrator to define cross-scope access to an application or application resource and allow or deny access requests. This feature is enabled in Security Incident Response by default so security analysts can protect sensitive security-related information.

A field called **Caller access** has been added to all tables and script includes in Security Incident Response, and the field defaults to **Caller Tracking**. This setting means that application scopes are allowed access to Security Incident Response tables and script includes. However, a tracking record is created for each record and stored in the Restricted Caller Access Privilege \[sys\_restricted\_caller\_access\] table.

**Note:** Take care when changing records from **Caller Tracking** to **Caller Restricted**. Records with this status cannot be accessed until an administrator manually allows access to it. The administrator must navigate to **System Applications** &gt; **Application Restricted Caller Access**, locate the table or script include for which access has been requested, and change the **Status** field from **Requested** to **Allowed**.

## Run quick start tests for Security Incident Response

Validate that Security Incident Response still works after you make any configuration changes, such as applying an upgrade or developing an application. Copy and customize these quick start tests to pass when using your instance-specific data.

Security Incident Response quick start tests require activating Security Incident Response plugin \(com.snc.security\_incident\) and loading the demo data.
