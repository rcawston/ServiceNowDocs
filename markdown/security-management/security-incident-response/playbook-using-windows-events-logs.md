        1.  In Action 7, create an incident to identify the system owner and the individual who deleted the logs.
        2.  In Action 8, check whether the user been identified after raising an incident or not.

            2.  In Action 11, isolate the host system.
            3.  In Action 12, remove any unwanted files that may have been created, and delete the rogue accounts.
            4.  In Action 13, lift the containment and bring the systems back to operational standards.
            5.  In Action 14, complete the post-incident review before closing the task.

                In Action 15, the flow ends.

4.  In Action 16, if the user has been identified, then check the user's role to see if the user is authorized to clear or remove logs.

5.  In Action 17, reach out to the user for validation of their business justification.

    You can use the provided email template to contact the user.
