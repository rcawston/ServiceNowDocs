# Start a Sidebar chat in Security Incident Response

Using Sidebar, security analysts can collaborate with others in real-time based on a Workspace task-based or interaction-based record. These Sidebar discussions facilitate the exchange of information and knowledge to help resolve issues faster and with higher-quality outcomes.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_si.read

Verify that you have activated the Omni-Experience Standard Feature Set plugin. For more information, see [Installing Sidebar](../../conversational-interfaces/sidebar/install-sidebar.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Security Incident Response Workspace**.

2.  Select the List view ![list view icon](../image/listview-icon.png) icon.

3.  Open a security incident for which you want to initiate a sidebar discussion.

4.  Select **Collaborate**, and then select **Start Chat**.

    The Start a Sidebar discussion dialog box appears.

    **Note:** Sidebar's integration with Microsoft Teams enables Sidebar users and Microsoft Teams users to communicate with each other from their respective platforms. For more information, see [Sidebar and Microsoft Teams](../../conversational-interfaces/sidebar/sidebar-teams-overview.md).

5.  On the Start a Sidebar discussion dialog box, fill in the fields.

-   By default, all users who have read access to the SIR records will also have access to sidebar chats, but this can be controlled using member query. For more information, see [Configuring Sidebar member query](../../conversational-interfaces/sidebar/configure-sidebar-member-query.md).
