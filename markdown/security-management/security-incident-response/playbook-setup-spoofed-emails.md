2.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Flow Designer** and select the **Spoofed Emails \(using the same Display name\)** playbook.

3.  You can create a copy of the Repeat Detection playbook flow and make the necessary modifications.

    To create a copy of the playbook's flow, click the ![More actions menu](../image/more-action-menu.png) icon and select **Copy flow**. Perform this step only if you plan to customize or make specific changes to the flow.
