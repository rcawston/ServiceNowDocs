2.  After you have successfully installed the application, navigate to **Integrations** &gt; **Integrations Configurations** and locate the ArcSight ESM tile.

3.  To configure the application, click **New**.

    ![ArcSight ESM: Configuration](../image/sir-arcsight-csm-creds.png)

    Each correlation event that you ingest from your ArcSight ESM Manager console requires a unique event profile in your instance. However, the ArcSight ESM source that you configure on the Event Ingestion Configuration form can be reused for multiple profiles as long as each profile ingests unique correlation event types.

7.  Click **Submit**.

    After it is successfully validated and submitted, each ArcSight ESM server configuration is saved on the Security Integrations page as a tile. If your saved configuration tiles are not displayed on the Security Integrations page, on the top right corner of the page, from the Show Configurations choice list, click **Yes**.


## What to do next

You have successfully installed and configured the application. The next step is to create an event profile.
