# McAfee ePO integration capability profiles

As a user with the security incident administrator \(sn\_si.admin\) role, you create profiles for the McAfee ePO capabilities in your ServiceNow AI Platform® instance. You group queries or actions in profiles and determine which McAfee ePO capabilities you want to run when a new security incident is created.

## Capability profiles

You create profiles™ so you can group McAfee ePO capabilities and configure the settings for these capabilities from your ServiceNow AI Platform® instance. You have the flexibility to create multiple profiles for these capabilities, which allows you to determine which actions or queries are invoked when a Security Incident Response \(SIR\) incident is created. To fit the needs of your organization, you can create a single profile that runs queries for system details, initiates malware scans, and isolates host machines, for example, or, you can create multiple profiles, each with its own, single McAfee ePO capability.
