# Security Incident Policy Violation workflow template

The Security Incident - Policy Violation - Template allows you to perform a series of tasks designed to handle security policy violations.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_si.write

## About this task

The workflow is triggered when the **Category** in a security incident is set to **Policy violation**. This action causes a response task to be created for the first activity in the workflow.

## Procedure

1.  Open the security incident for the policy violation, or [create a new security incident](t_ManuallyCreateSecurityIncident.md).

2.  In **Category**, select **Policy violation**.

3.  Save the record.

4.  Scroll down and open the **Response Tasks** related list.

    The first of a series of response tasks appears. Each time the record is saved, your response to the previous task either causes the next response task to be created or the workflow to end.
