# Playbook for Credential Sniffing

This playbook provides system remediation steps to investigate an incident involving credential sniffing activities performed through the **sys\_installation\_exit** table in a ServiceNow instance.

The Credential Sniffing playbook provides a script field to process the Database \(DB\) logins, Single sign-on \(SSO\), and LDAP \(Lightweight Directory Access Protocol\) by using the records on the **sys\_installation\_exit** table. These privileged scripting fields enable listening of user requests and parameters to the instances during login, including user credentials such as username and password.

A malicious user may create a script to listen to the user requests and log these requests on the instance. The **sys\_installation\_exit** table on an instance defines the rules of processing the login and logout activities of all users on that instance.
