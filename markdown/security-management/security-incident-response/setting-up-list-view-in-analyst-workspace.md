# List view in SIR Workspace

The list view consists of the security incidents, response tasks, phishing emails, and assessments.

The list view has pre applied filters such as Assigned to Me, Assigned to Team, Unassigned, All Open, All, and so on.

Using these list categories and filtered lists, analysts can quickly find the required Security Incidents and Response Tasks records that they need to work on.

To get to the list view, select the list icon \(![list view icon](../image/listview-icon.png)\). When you select a record in a list view, the record opens in a new tab.

## List types

The following gives you an example view of the lists.
