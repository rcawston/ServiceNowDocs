# View Major Security Incident impact metrics

Provides up-to-date summary reporting of the impact and progress of major security incidents, which is an important aspect of managing a major security incident using the new workspace.

The **Overview** tab provides the relevant metrics to manage both the scope and progress of the incident, including a rollup of affected assets, users, locations, and team resources, as well as the timeline of significant incident milestones.

Timeline provides a horizontal view of key events and milestones that have occurred as part of the specific major security incident resolution. The timeline component is displayed on top of all the Major Security Incident Management workspace tabs with an ability to collapse and expand for viewing as required. The events data represented will be updated and refreshed whenever designated milestone events or milestones are added or updated.

Each event or milestone is indicated with a different timeline event type option to identify the number and type of events or milestones. For example NOW record updates, collaboration activities. In addition, the time range period for the different major security incident states is tracked automatically and displayed using color-coded ranges displayed along with the duration of each incident state.
