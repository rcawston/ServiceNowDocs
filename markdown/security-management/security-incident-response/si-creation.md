# Security incident creation

Security incidents can be created manually from the form, or automatically via security events received from integrated third-party alert monitoring tools, such as Splunk.

**Important:** The latest features in Security Incident Response are exclusively available in the Security Incident Response Workspace. Install or upgrade to the latest Security Incident Response or Security Incident Response Workspace version to access and leverage features such as Shift-Handover, Risk Score Calculator, and so on.

If you have a security role, you can use any of the following methods to manually create security incidents.
