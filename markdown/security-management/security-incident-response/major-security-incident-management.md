# Major Security Incident Management

Track and manage various activities that are typically part of resolving a major security incident through Major Security Incident Management. Through an intuitive workspace, incident managers and those working on an incident can propose and promote incidents to major incidents, track major security incident activities, and easily collaborate with colleagues.

## Major Security Incident Management Overview

The major security incident management capabilities work in conjunction with the existing security incident response product capabilities. This includes an ability for a security analyst to escalate a standard security incident to a major security incident, so that the new product capabilities are available to support the remediation process.

After you install on your ServiceNow instance, a security incident analyst can:

-   Propose a security incident to major security incident candidate to initiate a review process on the need to create a major security incident.
-   Directly promote a security incident to a major security incident without the need for an additional review process.
-   Reject a security incident that is proposed as a major security incident \(MSI\).
-   Link a security incident as a child incident to the major security incident \(MSI\) so that all security incidents can be worked.
