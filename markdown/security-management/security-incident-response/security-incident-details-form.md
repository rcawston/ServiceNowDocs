Risk score

</td><td>

Displays the risk score calculated for this security incident. The value is based on the priority of the security incident, the type of security incident \(Denial of Service, Spear Phishing, or Malicious code activity\), and the number of sources that triggered a failed reputation score on an indicator. The risk score aids in prioritizing security incident work for analysts. Three security incident properties allow you to further designate a color-coded dot to appear next to the risk score in list view to make them more easily identifiable.

 If you change certain fields in the security incident, such as the **Business impact** or **Priority**, and save the record, the **Risk score** is automatically recalculated and displayed. The change is also reflected in the work notes and on the Risk Score Audits related list.

**Note:** The risk score is also recalculated when affected users are associated with a security incident, affected services, or vulnerable items.

 You can also manually enter a new **Risk score**. This can be useful if you want to keep a particular security incident at the top of the list of security incidents you’re analyzing. If you enter a new **Risk score**, the **Risk score override** check box is automatically selected. Regardless of the changes made in the security incident, a manually-entered risk score isn’t automatically recalculated.

**Note:** If you have upgraded your instance from a prior release, risk scores were calculated for all of your open security incidents. For more information, see [Understanding security incident calculators](setup-assistant-reference.md#).
