# Automatic security incident observable log data enrichment

When certain applications and integrations are set up, including Threat Intelligence and the Palo Alto Networks - Firewall integration, observables information in a security incident can be automatically enriched with threat log data whenever the Source IP for its observables is modified.

When a modification occurs, a business rule initiates a workflow that retrieves data from threat logs on your firewall and enriches the observables information in the security incident.

Before observables can be enriched, the following steps must be performed.

-   [Threat Intelligence](../c_GetStartedWithThreatIntel.md#) must be activated.
-   The [Palo Alto Networks Firewall](activate-config-firewall.md) integration must be activated and configured. This can also include [Set up SSH credentials to the MID Server](set-up-and-config-MID-server.md).

After that setup has been completed, the act of changing the Source IP of observables associated with a security incident causes a business rule to execute the **Security Operations Palo Alto Networks - Get Log Data** workflow. Workflow activities queue up a search query on the firewall and return a Job ID that is used to retrieve threat logs data from the firewall and attach them as an XML file to the security incident.
