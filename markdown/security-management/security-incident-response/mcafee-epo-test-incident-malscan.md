# Test security incidents to initiate malware scan

After you configure a profile for the malware scan, test the profile and view the security incidents that match the settings of your profile. Preview the scan results on the related lists of a ServiceNow AI Platform Security Incident Response \(SIR\) security incident.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_si.admin

## About this task

As a user with the sn\_si.admin role, verify that the profile with the malware scan capability is invoked and that the scan search results match what is expected with a preview of the related lists on a ServiceNow AI Platform Security Incident Response \(SIR\) security incident. The preview permits you to validate that scan results are returned as expected for the profile.

## Procedure

1.  If the Test Incident page is not displayed, click **Test Incident** in the progress bar.

    The Test Incident page is displayed for your profile. For this example, the Initiate Malware Scan profile you created and configured in the preceding sections is displayed.

2.  To the right of the top field, click the search icon to select a security incident to display on the preview.

    ![Search symbol highlighted.](../image/mcafee-im-test-2.png)

    Only security incidents that match the profile criteria are displayed.

3.  In the Number column of the list that is displayed, select an item that you want to display in the preview.

4.  Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all the incidents that you want to preview are displayed in the fields.

5.  Click **McAfee ePO Preview**.

6.  Scroll to view the work notes.

    **Note:** The list threat events workflow is part of the scan. For more information about creating a profile with the malware scan capability, see [Create a capability profile](mcafee-epo-create-profile.md).

    ![Work notes logging when capability tasks are initiated and successfully completed.](../image/mcafee-im-worknotes.png)

    Scans are sometimes scheduled to run during after peak working hours to minimize their impact to users on the network. The scan may not complete immediately. In this case, on the top of the security incident, a security tag is displayed indicating that the scan is scheduled. Refer to the work notes for status on the workflow. The work notes list when workflows start and are successfully completed. For this example, the work notes in the following figure show that the scan started, and that it successfully completed. The List Threat Events capability was also started and successfully completed as part of the scan.

    The following figure shows an example of a security tag on the related security incident.

    ![On security incident, McAfee ePO Scan Scheduled security tag.](../image/mcafee-im-test-6.png)

    On the security incident, after the scan is successfully completed, the scheduled tag is automatically replaced by the completed tag.
