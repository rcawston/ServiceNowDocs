# Edit a security incident observable list

You can edit which observables in the list associated with a security incident to display.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_si.basic

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Security Incident**.

2.  Choose an incident.

3.  Select the **Security Incident Observables** related list tab.

4.  Select **Edit**.

5.  Add or remove observables from the list.

    Create a filter for long lists.

6.  Select **Save**.

    **Note:** When you add an observable to the security incident, the system checks for any other configuration items or users associated with it. The **Related Configuration Items** and **Related Users** related list tabs are updated accordingly. Also, if the Threat Intelligence plugin is activated, and you have at least one [Security Incident Response integrations](sir_integrations.md) integration implementation activated, the [Security Operations Integration - Threat Lookup capability](../sec-ops-threat-lookups-capability.md) executes one or more workflows, and threat security lookups are performed on the observables you added. The results appear in the **Threat Lookup Results** tab.
