# Security Incident Response - Get Running Services workflow

The **Security Incident Response - Get Running Services workflow** retrieves a list of running services from Windows-based, ServiceNow, configuration items \(CIs\). This workflow is used for incident enrichment during investigations.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_si.analyst

## About this task

The **Security Incident Response - Get Running Services workflow** runs automatically when you add a new configuration item to a Windows security incident after the state changes to **Analysis**. The information this workflow obtains appears on the **Show Enrichment Data** tabs for the security incident.

**Note:** If the security incident remains in the **Draft** state, the **Security Incident Response - Get Running Services workflow** workflow does not run.

Workflow activities include:

-   Audit Log Enrichment Script activity
-   [Get Configuration Item FQDN Flow Action](../get-config-FQDN-activity.md)
-   [Determine Shell Script by OS activity](determine-shell-script-by-os-activity.md)
-   Is Execution via PowerShell activity
-   [Get Running Services - WMI Enrichment activity](get-running-services-via-pwrshell-activity.md)
-   [Create Enrichment Data records Flow Action](../create-enrich-data-records.md)

## Procedure

1.  Open a security incident.

2.  Update the **State** to **Analysis**, if necessary.

3.  Add a Windows-based configuration item \(server, laptop, or similar\).

4.  Select **Update**.

    Security Incident Response provides running services information in the **Related Links** &gt; **Security Incident Enrichments**tab. For more information, see [Security Operations enrichment data mapping](../enrichment-data-mapping.md).


-   **[Determine Shell Script by OS activity](determine-shell-script-by-os-activity.md)**  
The Determine Shell Script by OS workflow activity determines which operating system to use in the workflow
-   **[Get Running Services - WMI Enrichment](get-running-services-via-pwrshell-activity.md)**  
The **Security Incident Response - Get Running Services** workflow gathers running services on a configuration item added to a security incident.
