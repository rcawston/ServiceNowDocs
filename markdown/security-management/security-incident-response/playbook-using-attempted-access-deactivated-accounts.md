3.  If the attempted access to the deactivated accounts were made by an active employee, perform the following steps:

    1.  In Action 3, check if the user had a project or test case that caused the user to become an inactive employee.

    2.  In Action 4, if the user did not have a project or test case that caused the user to become an inactive employee, then work with the IT Support team to fix the misconfiguration.

        The flow ends.

    3.  In Action 5, if the user had a project or test case that caused the user to become an inactive employee, then perform the following steps:

        1.  In Action 6, document the findings so far.
        2.  In Action 7, initiate a post incident review.

            In Action 8, after the post incident review, the flow ends.

4.  In Action 9, if the attempted access to the deactivated account were not made by an active employee, perform the following steps:

    1.  In Action 10, verify if the user had any successful logins.

    2.  In Action 11, check when the employee was off-boarded.

    3.  In Action 12, investigate the events on Splunk to examine the user's activities during the time period.

    4.  In Action 13, based on the investigation so far, determine whether the user exfiltrated any data.

    5.  In Action 14, if the user did not exfiltrate any data, perform the following steps:

        1.  In Action 15, work with the IT Support team to terminate any active sessions and disable the accounts.
        2.  In Action 16, document the findings so far.
        3.  In Action 17, initiate a post incident review.
        In Action 18, after the post incident review, the flow ends.
