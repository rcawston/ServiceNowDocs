</table>**Note:**

1.  All actions listed are currently enabled by default. You will need to edit the **File Action Settings** if you do not want certain actions to appear. All the settings are currently global for all users, which means no ability to enable actions for a subset of the users that have a specific role.
2.  **Revoke User Access** and **Add Permissions** actions are system related actions. It is recommended not to modify these file actions.

The following sample procedure describes one of the file operations capabilities to disable any specific folder and file action during the configuration of the File Explorer Repository. This procedure is applicable to all other actions that may need to be edited:

Role required: sn\_msi.workspace\_admin

## Procedure

2.  Select the desired record to enable or disable the folder or file action respectively.
