# RISKIQ SSL certificate lookups that return an exact match

RISKIQ SSL certificate lookup results for an exact match are displayed on the **SSL Certificates** tab on the security incident record. An exact match provides a valid certificate authority name, which helps a security incident analyst determine the validity of a website.

## Exact match for a valid SSL certificate

The following example shows a valid issuer of an SSL certificate from an exact match in the lookup results. Follow the steps to view the results and raw data.

**Note:** The figures in the following examples are shown with the **Tabbed forms** setting active in the System Settings. If your screen does not match the view shown below, follow the steps to set tabbed forms.

1.  In the upper-right corner of the banner frame, click the Settings icon.
2.  In the **System Settings** dialog box that is displayed, click **Forms** and verify that **Tabbed forms** and **With the Form** are selected.

1.  In the security incident record, click the **SSL Certificates** tab.

    Information about the certificate issuer’s name, the issuer's organization, and who the certificate is issued to \(Organization\) is displayed along with other data.

    18 items are displayed in the **Issuer Name** column. The second item \(`R3`\) provides a valid certificate authority name \(`Let's Encrypt`\) in the **Issuer Organization** column.

    No information in the **Issuer Organization** and **Issued to** columns is displayed for the second item \(`mail.dgtnetworks.com`\).

2.  Click the second item in the **Issuer name**column, which is \(**R3**\) to open the entry record. Alternatively, click the information icon next to the item followed by **Open record**.
3.  Select the **Raw Data** tab.

    The SSL Certificate Entry record includes the observable in the **Raw Data** tab under the **Entity name** column, as well as other data.

    Note in the **Category** column, the `Subject`, and `Issuer` correspond to recognizable entities in the **Entity name** column. The issuer of this certificate is most likely valid and from a trusted public certificate authority. Also note, the `Subject`, and `Issuer` are different entities. These separate entities indicate that the certificate is not an internally signed certificate from an unknown certificate authority.


## Exact match for a self-signed SSL Certificate

The following example shows results for a self-signed SSL certificate from the lookup. Follow the steps to view the results and raw data.

1.  Navigate back to the security incident record. In the **Issuer Name** column, click the other item \(**mail.dgtnetworks.com**\).

    ![SSL Certificate Results tab.](../image/riskiq-ssl-cert-callout1.png "SSL Certificates tab")

2.  On the open record, select the **Raw Data** tab.

    ![SSL Raw Data tab.](../image/riskiq-selfsigned-ssl.png "Raw Data tab")

    The **Category** column indicates the `Issuer` \(`mail.dgtnetworks.com` and `dgtsbs.DGTNetworks.local`\) are not trusted public certificate authorities. Also note the `Issuer` and `Subject` are the same entity \(`dgtsbs.DGTNetworks.local`\), and each contains the name of the observable \(`dgtsbs`\). This certificate is possibly a self-signed certificate. Self-signed certificates may warrant further investigation, as these certificates are not issued by a known certificate authority.
