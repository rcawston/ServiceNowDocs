# Verify expected results for manual WHOISIQ lookups

Run a manual lookup on an observable when it does not automatically generate a security incident. For observable enrichment lookups using the WHOISIQ API for email addresses, organization names, phone numbers, or mailing addresses, initiate the lookup manually from the Observables table.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_si.analyst

## About this task

Create an observable for a manual lookup using the WHOISIQ API. For more information on how to create and edit an observable, see [Create an observable for manual WHOISIQ lookups](manually-attch-obsv-whoisiq.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **IoC Repository** &gt; **Observables** and locate the observable in the list you are working with.

2.  Click your observable in the **Value** column to open the record.

3.  Click the **Run Observable Enrichment** related link to run the lookup.

4.  In the **Run Observable Enrichment** window, move **RiskIQ Whois** to the Selected list.

5.  Click **Submit**.

    Lookup results are displayed on the **Observable Enrichment Results** tab on the observable record.

If no results are returned for the observable, a message is displayed in the **Summary** column. If you do not see results, verify the observable is supported by the API.
