# Security Incident Playbook

Invoke the security incident playbook flow automatically or manually.

A Playbook is visible only if at least one playbook is associated with a security incident. The playbook component works only for the Process Automation Designer \(PAD\) built processes and not for the flow designer-built flows. For the existing flow designer enabled flows, it will continue to work, and the activities will be continuing to be rendered as response tasks.

There are two ways of associating playbook with the security incident:

-   Automatically invoke playbook
-   Manually add playbook

## Invoke playbook automatically

For a Playbook to be invoked automatically, a process needs to be defined using **Process Automation Designer \(PAD\)**, and when the trigger condition is met then automatically the playbook tab is rendered with the playbook activities being displayed.

## Add playbook manually

For a Playbook to be invoked manually, navigate to the Form UI action drop down and select **Add Playbook**. For more information see, [Add Playbook](security-incident-playbook.md#)

**Note:** If there is already a playbook available then the new playbooks added will run in parallel to the existing playbooks.

-   Within the playbook, the analyst can filter the playbook cards by status.
-   The analyst can cancel a playbook by selecting it from the ellipse icon.
-   Within each activity, the analyst will be able to perform the actions defined within the activity cards such as Skip, Mark as complete, Cancel, or Orchestration actions such as Submit to sandbox, Search Emails and so on.
-   Each of these actions are defined within the activity definition, and the complete card visible is customizable at the time of building the activity definition itself.

**Note:** All the future activity definitions and the next steps to be performed are displayed with a lock icon and are in read-only mode to the user. The playbook display mode is controlled by a configuration as explained below.
