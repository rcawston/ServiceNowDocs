# Using CrowdStrike Falcon Insight integration in Analyst Workspace

Use the CrowdStrike Falcon Insight integration to leverage the CrowdStrike Falcon Insight capabilities on the SIR Analyst workspace.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_si.admin

Before you use CrowdStrike Falcon Insight integration on the Security Incident Response workspace, you must download it from the ServiceNow Store and configure it. For more information, see [Getting started with the CrowdStrike Falcon Insight integration](get-started-with-the-crowdstrike-falcon-insight-integration.md).

## About this task

You can use the CrowdStrike Falcon Insight integration to make remediation actions on the endpoints in real time, use profiles to gather details about the host, and make specific queries or actions on the endpoint using the Security Incident Response workspace.

The CrowdStrike Falcon Insight integration enables analysts to use the following CrowdStrike Falcon Insight capabilities on the Security Incident Response Analyst workspace:

-   **Get Host Details**
-   **Get Logged On Users**
-   **Get Network Statistics**
-   **Get Running Processes**
-   **Get Running Services**
-   **Isolate Host**
-   **Remove Isolation**
-   **Get File**

## Procedure

1.  In the SIR workspace, open the required security incident and select the **Related Records** tab.

2.  You can use the CrowdStrike Falcon Insight capabilities on the Business Impact related list for analysis.

    1.  Select a **Configuration Item**, and choose a capability from the dropdown list.
