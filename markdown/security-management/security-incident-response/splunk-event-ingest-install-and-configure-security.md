**Note:**

-   The MID Server selected during this configuration time applies throughout this integration.
-   Only MID Servers that are active and validated are displayed on this list. By default, the value is set to **Any**.
For example, there are three MID Servers A, B, and C. If you select **Any**, then one of these MID Servers is auto-selected and applies throughout this integration. If you select a specific MID Server, say C, then the selected MID Server C applies throughout this integration.

If you want to change the MID Server, then you have to reconfigure it from the App Configuration tile.

However, the source that you configure on the Event Ingestion Configuration form can be reused for multiple ServiceNow AI Platform® profiles as long as each profile ingests unique notable event types.

5.  Select **Submit**.
