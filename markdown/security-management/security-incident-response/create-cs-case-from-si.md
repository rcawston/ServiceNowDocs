# Create a Customer Service case from a security incident

Security Incident Response ships with a default field mapping that maps a security incident to a Customer Service \(CS\) case. You can create a CS case from any security incident, edit the **Priority**, and also add **Optional notes**.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_si.basic and sn\_customerservice\_agent

**Note:** The Customer Service plugin must be activated to perform this task.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Security Incident**.

2.  Open the security incident that you want to add a CS case to.

3.  Select **Create Customer Service Case** in the top header.

    The pop-up window is prepopulated with information from the security incident based on your field mapping.

4.  You can select a new **Priority** and add any **Optional notes**.

    **Note:** The **Priority** field overwrites the default setting. The **Optional notes** are appended to the incident.

5.  Select **Submit.**

    A CS case is created and displayed in the Customer Service Cases related list in the security incident.

6.  You can select the CS case link to follow up on the case.
