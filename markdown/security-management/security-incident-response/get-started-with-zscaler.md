Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Assign and verify the required ServiceNow AI Platform and Security Incident Response roles.

</td><td>

These roles are required for configuration and verification of the expected results:-   The admin role installs the integration from the ServiceNow Store and assigns the sn\_si.admin role.
-   The sn\_si.admin role performs the following tasks:
    -   Configures the integration.
    -   Creates, activates, and removes the URL Category lists.
    -   Assigns the sn\_si.analyst role.
-   The sn\_si.analyst role creates entries and works with security incidents.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Verify that the ServiceNow core applications are installed and activated before you configure this integration.

</td><td>

The ServiceNow Integration Hub Enterprise Pack Installer \[com.glide.hub.integrations.enterprise\] plugin is required.

 The Security Incident Response plugin \(com.snc.security\_incident\) is required. This plugin automatically installs all the dependencies for the Security Incident Response product. Install and activate this plugin before you install and activate the other Security Operations applications for the integration.

 Verify that the following Security Operations applications are installed and activated from the ServiceNow Store. If these applications are not already installed, install and activate each application one at a time in the following order:

 1.  Security Incident Response Dependency \(com.snc.si\_dep\)
2.  Security Integration Framework
3.  Security Support Common
4.  Security Support Orchestration
5.  Threat Intelligence Support Common
6.  Trusted Security Circles
7.  Security Operations Setup Assistant
