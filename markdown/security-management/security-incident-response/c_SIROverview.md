# Security Incident Response Overview dashboard

The Security Incident Response Overview dashboard provides an executive view into security incident activity, providing trends and reports, and drill-downs into specific data.

The Overview module displays security incident information that is tailored to the role of the user. You can point to any part of a chart \(bar, pie, data point, heatmap, and so on\) to view general data specific to that part. See the following image. If you click any part of a report, a list opens to provide detailed information.
