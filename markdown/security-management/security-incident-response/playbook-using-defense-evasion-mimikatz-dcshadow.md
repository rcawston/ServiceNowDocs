2.  In Action 2, reach out to the user to validate the business justification.

    You can use the provided email template to contact the user.

    2.  In Action 6, initiate a post incident review.

        In Action 7, after the post incident review, the flow ends.

    1.  In Action 9, lock down or quarantine all the accounts, computers, and other devices involved.

    2.  In Action 10, perform a forensic investigation on the locked-down accounts and identify if any data has been exfiltrated or any malicious code has been injected.

    3.  In Action 11, reimage the affected resources.

    4.  In Action 12, lift containment and bring systems back to operational standards.

    5.  In Action 13, complete the post-incident review before closing the task.
