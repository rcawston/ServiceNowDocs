# Create a capability profile

Create a profile and select the McAfee ePO capabilities that you want the profile to run.

## Before you begin

Role required: ServiceNow AI Platform® Security incident administrator \(sn\_si.admin\)

## About this task

For this step of the configuration, you create a profile for the McAfee ePO capabilities. When you create profiles, consider the intention of the profile before you add McAfee ePO capabilities to it. Refer to the following table when you create profiles.

The following table lists the capabilities that you are required to add to a profile if you want the profile perform certain queries or actions. Create a single profile that runs queries for host details, initiates malware scans, remove isolation, and isolates host machines, or, create multiple profiles, each with its own, single capability.
