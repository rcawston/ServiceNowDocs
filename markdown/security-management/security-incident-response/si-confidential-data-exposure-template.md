# Security Incident Confidential Data Exposure workflow template

The Security Incident - Confidential Data Exposure - Template allows you to perform a series of tasks designed to handle the exposure of sensitive data.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_si.write

## About this task

The workflow is triggered when the **Category** in a security incident is set or changed to **Confidential personal identity data exposure**. This action causes a response task to be created for the first activity in the workflow.

2.  In **Category**, select **Confidential personal identity data exposure**.

3.  Save the record.

4.  Scroll down and open the **Response Tasks** related list.
