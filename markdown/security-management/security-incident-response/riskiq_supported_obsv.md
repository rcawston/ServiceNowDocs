description: The RISKIQ API supports automatic SSL certificate lookups on IP address, file hash, Certificate Serial Number, domain, and URL observables. URL and domain observables are enriched automatically with the WHOISIQ API. For observable enrichment on other types of observables with the WHOISIQ API, create observables and run lookups manually from the Observables table.

# Supported observables for RISKIQ and RISKIQ WHOISIQ

The RISKIQ API supports automatic SSL certificate lookups on IP address, file hash, Certificate Serial Number, domain, and URL observables. URL and domain observables are enriched automatically with the WHOISIQ API. For observable enrichment on other types of observables with the WHOISIQ API, create observables and run lookups manually from the Observables table.

## Supported observables

The following table lists the type of APIs used in this integration, and the observables each API supports. The table also indicates whether a lookup occurs automatically when security incidents are created, or if the lookup is run manually from the Observables table.

**Note:** automatic scans are run for the URL format using the `https://` protocol, for example,`https://example.com/index.html`

</table>## Example of a file hash and certificate serial number

This figure shows an example of the file hash and certificate serial number observables used for the SSL certificate lookups for this integration. The file hash refers to a SHA-1fingerprint. This value is displayed in your ServiceNow AI Platform instance without the colon separators. For example, `646D4B7A0C59A66656E94DDADD6C798027EFC10F`.

The certificate serial number observable refers to the unique ID or serial number for the entity. This value is also displayed without the colon separators. For example, `00EA0F74B56D44BBBE0000000050DE1DFD`.
