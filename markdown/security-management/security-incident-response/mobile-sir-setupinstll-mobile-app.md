2.  If the Security Incident Response core application is not already installed, click **Install** to install it.

 For more information about installing the Security Incident Response core application, see [Install and configure Security Incident Response](install-and-configure-sir.md).

 To verify that these dependencies are installed:

1.  Navigate to **Plugins**.
2.  Search for the plugin IDs \(com.glide.sg and com.glide.sg.agent\_native\_client\).

As a user with the ServiceNow AI Platform admin role, verify that you have assigned mobile users with the required roles in your ServiceNow AI Platform instance. 1.  To view the roles that are assigned to a user, navigate to **Users and Groups** &gt; **Users**.
2.  Select the user name followed by the roles related list. All roles assigned to this user are displayed.
3.  Verify a user is assigned, or assign a user with the IT Infrastructure Library role \(itil\). Users with the itil role can create, open, update and close security incidents. Only users with the itil role can have tasks assigned to them.
4.  Verify a user is assigned, or assign a user with the security analyst role \(sn\_si.analyst\). Users with the sn\_si.analyst role can read and edit security incident records. This role is automatically added when you assign the itil role.
5.  Verify you have created any required assignment groups and assigned mobile users to these groups.

 **Note:** If you have a large number of users for the mobile application, you alternatively can assign the sn\_si.analyst role to a group. Each user you add to the group inherits this role.
