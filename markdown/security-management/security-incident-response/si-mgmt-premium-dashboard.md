## Security Incident Management Premium indicators

The Process by State and Process by Age tabs contain workbench widgets with the following indicators:

-   **Average age**

    The Average age of open security incidents indicator uses the formula `[[Summed age of open security incidents]] / [[Number of open security incidents]] / 24` to give a result in days.

-   **Average reassignment times**

    The Average re-assignment of open security incidents indicator uses the formula `Summed re-assignment of open security incidents / Number of open security incidents`.

-   **Average age of last update**

-   **% not updated in 5 days**

    The % of open security incidents not updated in last 5 days indicator uses the formula `( [[Number of open security incidents not updated in the last 5 days]] / [[Number of open security incidents]] ) * 100`.
