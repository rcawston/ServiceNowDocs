## About this task

Security incidents enable tracking and management of remediation efforts for vulnerabilities in TISC, supporting prioritized response and maintaining auditability. For more information, see [Create Security Incident from a Vulnerability Record](../threat-intelligence-security-center/tisc-create-security-incident.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Security Incident Workspace**.

2.  Select the **Security Incidents** icon on the workspace.

3.  Navigate to **Lists** &gt; **All**.
