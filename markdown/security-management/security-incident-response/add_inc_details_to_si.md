# Add information to a security incident

After a security incident is created, you can add more details to aid in analysis, such as access roles and different kinds of notes.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_si.basic

## Procedure

1.  If it is not already open, open the security incident you want to update.

2.  Click the **Incident Details** tab.

3.  Fill in the fields, as needed.

<table id="table_l2p_dcs_ns"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Read access

</td><td>

Gives a user with the **special access** role read access to the security incident. The user is able to read and write work notes. **Note:**

-   If a user is added to both **Read access** and **Privileged access** lists, then only the **Privileged access** permissions persist.
-   User with sn\_si.admin role only can modify both read access and privileged access.

Click the lock icon to add users who are notified when changes to the security incident occur. After the field is unlocked, options are available for adding or removing multiple users or entering user email addresses. When you have completed your entries, click the lock icon to lock the field.

Privileged access

</td><td>

Gives a user with the **special access** role read and write access to all fields of the security incident except **Assigned to**. Users with special access roles have their own module containing all security incidents assigned to them. No other modules are available to them. No one else can see the **Visible to Me** module.**Note:**

Only an assigned user or someone with a security role \(for example, sn\_si\_analyst or sn\_si.admin\) can change the **Assigned to** field.

If a user is added to both **Read access** and **Privileged access** lists, then only the **Privileged access** permissions persist.
