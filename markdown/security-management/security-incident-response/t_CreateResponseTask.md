# Create response tasks

After a security incident has been created, you can create response tasks to track separate actions to be performed to respond to the security issue.

## Before you begin

**Important:** If you are unable to create a response task, verify that no custom ACLs on the task table are blocking access.

Role required: sn\_si.basic

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the appropriate location to open the security incident for which you want to create tasks.

    For example:

    -   To create a response task based on a security incident assigned to you, select **Security Incident** &gt; **Incidents** &gt; **Assigned to Me**.
    -   To create a response task based on a security incident assigned to your team, select **Security Incident** &gt; **Incidents** &gt; **Assigned to Team** &gt; **Incidents**.
    -   To create a response task based on an unassigned security incident, select **Security Incident** &gt; **Incidents** &gt; **Unassigned Incidents**.
2.  Open the security incident for which you want to add response tasks.

3.  Select the **Add Response Task** button in the form header.

    **Note:** To create any other task, select the **Tasks** tab in the incident Related List.
