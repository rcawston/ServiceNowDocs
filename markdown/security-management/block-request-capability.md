# Security Operations Integration- Block Request capability

The Block Action capability blocks observables associated with a security incident on a firewall, web proxy, or other control point using implementation flows. This capability is used during incident response investigations to contain an identified threat.

The Block Request capability has a flow, [Security Operations Integration - Block Request Flow](secops-integration-block-request-workflow.md), that executes the request to block. This flow accepts a list of observables, finds any implementing capabilities, and executes the request based on the configured flow.

**Note:** If no implementations are available, capability actions are not displayed in product menus.

-   **[Run Block Request](run-block-request.md)**  
Blocks communication with observables associated with a security incident.
-   **[Security Operations Integration - Block Request Flow](secops-integration-block-request-workflow.md)**  
The Security Operations Integration - Block Request flow is a high-level flow independent of integrations. It blocks observables associated with a security incident. Use it to fulfill an integration such as Palo Alto Networks - Firewall.
