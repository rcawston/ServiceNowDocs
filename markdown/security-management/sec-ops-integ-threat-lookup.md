# Security Operations Integration - Threat Lookup Flow

The **Security Operations Integration - Threat Lookup** capability flow accesses available threat lookup implementations and executes the implementation flows associated with each to perform threat lookups of selected observables.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ti.write

## About this task

This flow can be triggered in these ways.

-   by selecting one or more observables from the Observables list and selecting **Run threat lookup** from the **Actions on selected rows** choice list.
-   by opening an observable record and clicking the **Run threat lookup** related link.
-   From the Observables related list in a security incident.

Each method then allows you to specify which lookup implementations to be used to scan the selected observables. The associated implementation flows are executed to perform the lookups.
