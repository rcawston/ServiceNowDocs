# Preparing for installing the Vulnerability Response Integration with Palo Alto Prisma Cloud

Prepare for installing the Vulnerability Response Integration with Palo Alto Prisma Cloud by performing setup tasks.

## Before you begin

To integrate Vulnerability Response with Palo Alto Prisma Cloud, you must be assigned a permission group in Prisma that provides read-only access to Policy and Alerts data. You can find more information on permission groups at [Prisma Cloud Administrator Roles](https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/classic/cspm-admin-guide/manage-prisma-cloud-administrators/prisma-cloud-administrator-roles#id437b5c4a-3dfa-4c70-8fc7-b6d074f5dffc).

For detailed information on the roles assigned to different permission groups, refer to the page [Prisma Cloud Administrator Permissions](https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/classic/cspm-admin-guide/manage-prisma-cloud-administrators/prisma-cloud-admin-permissions).

In addition, access keys must be created to enable reading the alerts. For more information on creating access keys, see [Create and Manage Access Keys](https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/classic/cspm-admin-guide/manage-prisma-cloud-administrators/create-access-keys).
