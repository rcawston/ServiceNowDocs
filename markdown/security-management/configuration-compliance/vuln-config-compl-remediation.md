# Configuration Compliance remediation

Configuration Compliance remediation is primarily a manual process augmented by scheduled jobs \(integrations\), remediation tasks, workflows, and change requests.

**Note:** Starting with v14.9 of Configuration Compliance, the following terms have been renamed:

|Terminology prior to v14.9|Terminology v14.9 onwards|
|--------------------------|-------------------------|
|Test Result Group|Remediation Task|
|Group Rules|Remediation Task Rules|
|Policy|Test group|

Separate third-party SCA plugins acquire and transform data in Configuration Compliance. Before you can use Configuration Compliance to remediate configuration items, you must install a third-party scanner integration and perform at least one network scan.

Use change requests to remediate individual test failures from remediation tasks.

The states of remediation tasks automatically transition as associated change requests move through their life cycles with [State synchronization between change requests and remediation tasks](cc-cr-state-synch.md). Users with the itil role can create and manage change requests directly from remediation tasks.
