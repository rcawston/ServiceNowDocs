# Manually create a Configuration Compliance remediation task from the Test Results list

You can manually create a remediation task from the **Test Result** list and perform remediation from the resulting remediation task.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_vulc.admin

## About this task

This method requires selecting test results to include and creating the group from the **Actions on selected rows...** menu. This method is good for results that are not easily filtered or situations where you want to specify test results for remediation.

**Note:** Starting with v14.9 of Configuration Compliance, the following terms have been renamed:

|Terminology prior to v14.9|Terminology v14.9 onwards|
|--------------------------|-------------------------|
|Test Result Group|Remediation Task|
|Group Rules|Remediation Task Rules|
|Policy|Test group|

## Procedure

2.  In the navigation panel, select a Test Result module to open a list.

3.  Select the test results to include in the remediation task by checking the box next to each one.

4.  Open the **Actions on selected rows...** menu at the bottom of the list.
