# Components installed with Configuration Compliance

Several types of components are installed with activation of the Configuration Compliance plugin, including tables and user roles.

Starting with v15.1.5 of Configuration Compliance, the most frequently used system properties are now accessible within the Configuration Compliance application. To view these system properties, navigate to **All**Configuration Compliance**Properties**.

**Note:** The Application Files table lists the components that are installed with this application. For instructions on how to access this table, see [Find components installed with an application](../../platform-administration/find-components.md).

Demo data is available for this feature.

**Note:** Starting with v14.9 of Configuration Compliance, the following terms have been renamed:

|Terminology prior to v14.9|Terminology v14.9 onwards|
|--------------------------|-------------------------|
|Test Result Group|Remediation Task|
|Group Rules|Remediation Task Rules|
|Policy|Test group|

## View filtered lists for components installed with an application

Filter the Applications Files table so that only the roles, scheduled jobs, and tables that are installed with an application are displayed. The application you want to view these components for should be installed so that its files are loaded onto the instance and into the metadata table. Follow these steps to view filtered lists from the Applications Files table.

1.  In the filter navigator, enter **sys\_metadata.list** to navigate to the metadata table.
2.  Select the condition builder \(filter icon\), and select, **Application** &gt; **is** followed by the name of your application. For example, **Application** &gt; **is** &gt; **Vulnerability Response**.
3.  In the condition builder, to add a second filter, select **AND**, then select, **Class** &gt; **is a** and choose one of the following classes from the list: **Role**, **Scheduled job**, or **Table**.
4.  Select **Run**.

The results for the class you selected are displayed in a filtered list.
