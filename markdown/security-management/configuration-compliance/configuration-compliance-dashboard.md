# Viewing the Performance Analytics for Configuration Compliance dashboard

You can manage your most important configuration issues and remediate them quickly by viewing the reports on the Configuration Compliance Performance Analytics \(PA\) dashboard.

**Note:** Starting with v14.9 of Configuration Compliance, the following terms have been renamed:

|Terminology prior to v14.9|Terminology v14.9 onwards|
|--------------------------|-------------------------|
|Test Result Group|Remediation Task|
|Group Rules|Remediation Task Rules|
|Policy|Test group|



## Required ServiceNow AI Platform roles

The following roles are required for the Configuration Compliance Performance Analytics dashboard:

-   admin: An admin can install and activate the Performance Analytics for Configuration Compliance and make changes to the system properties.
-   pa\_admin: A performance analytics administrator can create and review the background jobs, indicators, breakdowns, widgets, and dashboards. This admin can also set up and start the data collection.
-   sn\_vulc.read: A user with the read role can review the dashboard data.

## Access the Configuration Compliance dashboard

To open the dashboard, navigate to **All** &gt; **Configuration Compliance** &gt; **Overview**.

**Important:**

Starting with version 14.9 of Configuration Compliance, this dashboard can also be viewed in the Next Experience UI. To view the dashboard in the new UI, navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Vulnerability Manager Workspace** and click the **Dashboards** icon. Depending on your role, the default dashboard is displayed. To view other dashboards, click the drop-down next to the dashboard name. For more information, see the [Dashboards in the Vulnerability Manager Workspace](../vulnerability-manager-workspace/vr-ws-dashboards.md) and [Dashboards in the IT Remediation Workspace](../it-remediation-workspace/itr-ws-dashboards.md).

**Note:** If you are on Tokyo, you can view the dashboards in the Next Experience UI but with some functional loss.

## Configuration Compliance \[PA\] dashboard tabs

The **Overview** tab provides five filters. These filters are the Asset category, Cloud resource type, Cloud service provider, Cloud account, and Cloud region, which you can apply to visualize the reports for the filters applied. If you select a category and apply the changes, all the widgets that support the category get refreshed. Each widget displays the applied filter at the bottom and the number of filters applied on the filter icon of the widget. Click the report in a widget to view the additional information on the **KPI Details** tab. On the **KPI Details** tab, you can:

-   Show the records.
-   Compare the records.
-   Change the chart type.
-   Select the date range.
-   View the trends that are based on the duration.
-   Apply the additional filters including the filters that are unavailable on the **Overview** tab. An example is the Host tag.

The following example shows how you can apply the filters in the **Overview** tab and perform the actions in the **KPI Details** tab.

Overview tab in Configuration Compliance dashboard

The **Compliance** tab displays the compliance percentage for the various authoritative sources, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act \(HIPAA\) and the Data Interchange Standards Association \(DISA\). You can refine this list by using the column header filters and selecting a category.

The following example shows how you can filter the data in the **Compliance** tab.

The **Remediation** tab displays the information about the progress of how remediation is going. You can use this tab to see into the misconfiguration remediation hygiene.

The following example shows the **Remediation** tab.

The reports on the **Approvals** tab display the information about the exception requests and their approval status.

The following example shows the **Approvals** tab.

## Breakdowns

The breakdowns that are used by the indicators are as follows:

-   Deferred Reason
-   Age
-   Assignment group
-   Remediation status
-   Result
-   Risk rating
-   Asset category
-   Host tag
-   Configuration test
-   Cloud service provider
-   Cloud region
-   Cloud account
-   Cloud resource type

**Note:** Customizing the Age and Age closed calculation for test results may lead to a sharp rise or drop in the Performance Analytics \(PA\) reports that include these metrics. For more information on how to customize the calculation of Age and Age closed for test results, see the [KB1703270](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1703270) KB article.

## Filters

In the **Overview** tab, you can apply the following filters to the widgets to visualize the filtered data.
