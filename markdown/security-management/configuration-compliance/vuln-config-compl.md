## What is Configuration Compliance

The ServiceNow® Configuration Compliance application enables you to prioritize and remediate the most critical configuration-related vulnerabilities in your environment quickly and efficiently. Configuration Compliance is available by subscription in the ServiceNow® Store.

## Key features of Configuration Compliance

Use the Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\) in your ServiceNow AI Platform® to help you expose and fix your most critical configuration-related security vulnerabilities. Focus your remediation resources on activities with the greatest risk reduction. Streamline the remediation process across security, IT, and your business process stakeholders. The Configuration Compliance application includes the following key features:

-   With supported third-party integrations, automatically import policies, tests, authoritative sources, and technologies. See [Configuration Compliance integrations](vuln-config-compl-integrations.md) for more information about supported integrations.
-   Correlate policies and tests to configuration items \(assets\) to identify configuration-related vulnerabilities and help you verify that your assets are in compliance with your policies and controls.
-   Unify configuration assessment, assignment, and remediation across all of your assets.
-   Configuration scanning content can be imported from leading Secure Configuration Assessment \(SCA\) ecosystem integration applications.
-   Configuration findings, test failures, can be grouped and routed automatically based on remediation specialist skill sets and areas of responsibility. Intelligent workflows and tight integration with change management provide smooth task hand-offs between groups.
-   When used with the ServiceNow Governance, Risk, and Compliance \(GRC\) application, configuration tests in Configuration Compliance can be rolled up to their corresponding GRC controls.
-   With enhanced change management, create pre-populated change requests for IT directly from Configuration Compliance to help you with your remediation tasks that require additional resources.
-   With dashboards, view remediation status metrics on remediation task, compliance test, and policy records.
