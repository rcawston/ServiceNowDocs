Risk score

</td><td>

This score is the rolled-up value of the risk scores for all the active test results in a remediation task. This score changes as test results are remediated in the remediation task.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Assignment group

</td><td>

Group selected to work on this remediation task.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Risk rating

</td><td>

The amount of risk a failed test result poses to your system. It is based on a range of risk scores on a 1-5 numeric scale that rates risks as Critical \(1\) to None \(5\).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Assigned to

</td><td>

Individual from the selected assignment group that works on this set of tasks.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Remediation target

</td></tr><tr><td>

Remediation status

</td><td>

Status of the remediation for the group. It is determined by the test result with the nearest due date.

For open groups states include In-flight, Approaching Target and Target Missed. For closed groups states include No Target, Target Met and Target Missed.For calculated remediation target dates, if the remediation task is closed, the overall remediation status of all of the closed test results is shown in the remediation task. Those determine whether the group met its date or not.

A closed remediation task remediation Status is **No Target** if none of its closed results had a remediation target date. It is **Target Missed** if any of its closed results missed their target date. It is **Target Met** if at least one closed result met its target and none of the others missed it.
