# Request an exception for remediation tasks using GRC: Policy and Compliance Management

Request policy exceptions using the GRC policy exception management capability in the Policy and Compliance Management application from within Configuration Compliance.

## Before you begin

Before you can use the Policy Exception Integration to request policy exceptions, you must download the GRC: Policy and Compliance Management application from the ServiceNow Store.

Role required: sn\_vulc.remediation\_owner

You can also request exceptions in the classic UI.

## About this task

**Important:** As an admin and a remediation owner, you can request a policy exception for a Remediation Task \(RT\) in the [Vulnerability Manager Workspace](../vulnerability-manager-workspace/vr-ws-exceptions-split-VMGR-ws.md) and [IT Remediation Workspace](../it-remediation-workspace/vr-ws-request-exception-grc.md) respectively.

**Note:** Starting with v14.9 of Configuration Compliance, the following terms have been renamed:

|Terminology prior to v14.9|Terminology v14.9 onwards|

|Test Result Group|Remediation Task|
|Group Rules|Remediation Task Rules|
|Policy|Test group|

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Application Vulnerability Response** &gt; **Application Vulnerable Items** \(or **Remediation Tasks**\)&gt;**All**, and open the item or group for which you want to request an exception.

    The selected item or group must be in Open, Under investigation, or Awaiting implementation state.

2.  On the selected form, click **Request Exception**.
