# View Configuration Compliance test groups

Once you have imported the results of a third-party scan into your instance, you can see your test compliance at the test group level. Use this view before an audit of that test group and any associated test records.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_vulc.read and sn\_vulc.remediation\_owner to view

## About this task

Test groups are imported records and you cannot edit them in the Configuration Compliance application.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Configuration Compliance** &gt; **Test Groups**.

    The list of Test results display. Starting with v15.0 of Configuration Compliance, the **% Test Result Compliance** column displays the percentage of test results that are compliant with the tests in a test group.

    % Test Result Compliance = \(No. of Test results closed in a test group/Total no. of test results associated with a test group\) \* 100

2.  Click the **Short description** of the Test Group you want to view.

</table>    Starting with version 12.0, to update these values on-demand, below the Remediation status tab, click the **Update Status** related link. A message is displayed that indicates the data is being refreshed. Click the **View status** link to view progress on the update. After a few moments, any data that has changed or been updated since the last scheduled job are refreshed on the record. Updated field values are refreshed.

3.  Disable the import of test results for a test group by selecting the **Disable import** button.

    The value in the **Is import disabled** column changes to true. The test results for the test group are not imported from the upcoming ingestion.

    **Note:** The **Disable import** button is available for the test results obtained from the Qualys scanner only.

    Starting with v23.0 of Vulnerability Response:

    -   You can enable or disable the import of test results for a Qualys test group in the Vulnerability Manager Workspace. For more information, see [Enable or disable the import of test results for a Qualys test group](../vulnerability-manager-workspace/enable-disable-imports-qualys.md).
    -   The **Mark deprecated** button is renamed to **Disable import**.
    -   The **Is deprecated** column is renamed to **Is import disabled**.
