## About this task

You can also request an extension from the Vulnerability Response Workspaces. For more information, see [Request an extension for a deferred vulnerable item in the Vulnerability Manager workspace](../vulnerability-manager-workspace/extend-defer-vul-item-ws.md).

**Note:** Starting with v14.9 of Configuration Compliance, the following terms have been renamed:

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Configuration Compliance** &gt; **Exception Rules**.

2.  Select an approved exception rule.

3.  Select **Request Extension**.

    -   If a deferred exception rule is extended again, the extend deferral count increases in the backend.
