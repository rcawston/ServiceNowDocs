# Configuration Compliance reporting

The Configuration Compliance homepage provides an executive view into policies, CIs, tests, and test results, helping security staff pinpoint areas of concern quickly. Configuration Compliance significance charts can be added, as needed. You can also return Configuration Compliance -related information using the global search feature.

**Note:** Starting with v14.9 of Configuration Compliance, the following terms have been renamed:

|Terminology prior to v14.9|Terminology v14.9 onwards|
|--------------------------|-------------------------|
|Test Result Group|Remediation Task|
|Group Rules|Remediation Task Rules|
|Policy|Test group|

In each chart, you can point to any part of a chart \(bar, pie, data point\) to view general data specific to that part of the chart. If you click any part of a report, a list opens to provide detailed information.

**Note:**

-   Dashboards on the Configuration Compliance homepage are available only when the Performance Analytics for Configuration Compliance application is activated. For steps to activate this application, see [Activate Performance Analytics for Configuration Compliance](configuration-compliance-install.md).
-   Anyone with the sn\_vulc.read role can view the dashboard. Anyone in the sn\_vulc.write or sn\_vulc.admin role can create and edit a dashboard. Only sn\_vulc.admin can delete a dashboard.
