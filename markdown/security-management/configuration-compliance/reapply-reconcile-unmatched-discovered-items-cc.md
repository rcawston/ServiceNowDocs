# Reconcile unmatched discovered items for Configuration Compliance

Create a schedule job to reconcile unmatched discovered items. When a test result is created, the configuration item \(CI\) added to it at the time of creation might be an outdated one.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

If the information in the CMDB changes, unmatched CI information is not reconciled. To reconcile, apply CI lookup rules on the test results that are in an unmatched state when the CMDB is updated with the latest CIs.

A schedule job is run on demand to reapply the CI matching rule for the discovered items in an unmatched state. If the CI changes after reapplying the lookup rules, the discovered items are updated with the new CI. Impacted test results are also updated. For details, see [CI changes for discovered items for Configuration Compliance](reapply-discovered-items-ci-changes-cc.md).

**Note:**

Starting with Configuration Compliance v24, you can skip the reapplication of CI lookup rules on discovered items with the substate ‘CI Decommissioned’ by enabling the system property **sn\_sec\_cmn.skipItemsWithCIDecommissioned**.
