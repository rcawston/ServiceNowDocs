2.  Select **Administration** in the navigation pane.

3.  Select **Review** on the **Exclusion rules** tile.

4.  On the Rules page, select **Exclusion** in the navigation pane.

5.  Select **New** and fill in the fields on the form:

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Details|
    |Name|Name of the exclusion rule.|
    |Active|Option to activate the exclusion rule.|
    |Execution order|Unique order for each exclusion rule.|
