# Create Approval Rules

Configure approval rules that require one or more approvers to authorize an advanced response option before it is applied to a DLP incident.

## Before you begin

Role required:

-   sn\_dlir.admin
-   sn\_dlir.analyst and sn\_dlir.analyst\_read

## About this task

An approval rule is triggered when an end user selects a response option that is marked as Advanced on a DLP incident. When the rule's conditions match the incident fields, the system initiates an approval request and routes it to the configured approvers before the response option can be applied. If multiple rules match, the rule with the lowest **Execution order** value runs first.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **DLP Administration** &gt; **DLP Approval Rules**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_ilq_qrg_zrb"><thead><tr><th>

</td></tr><tr><td>

Active

</td><td>

Option to indicate whether the approval rule is active.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Execution order

</td><td>

The approval rule priority. This field indicates the order in which the approval rules are executed when two or more rules share the triggering conditions.

 The approval rule with the lowest number has the highest priority. To set the order of operation, enter a value. For example, 100, 200, 300, and so on.

 The default value is 100.

Conditions in the condition builder. These conditions are based on the DLP incident table. To build a condition for the approval rule, select any of the incident fields. Use the lists and fields of the conditions builder to set the filters for the first row.

To add more conditions, select **AND** or **OR**.

-   If **AND** is selected, all conditions must be matched.
-   If **OR** is selected, either condition can be matched.
To set a second filter condition, select **New Criteria**.

For example, you can set the conditions for this incident consolidation rule by selecting the condition as **Integration Source**, **contains**, **Microsoft**.

</td><td>

This field will appear when **User Table** is selected for **Approver** option.Enter a number in this field to define the levels of approval.

For example, if 3 is added in the Number of levels field and Manager is selected in the Approver identifier field then approval request will traverse to three levels of approval.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    For example, your organization requires manager approval before a DLP analyst can apply the **Block** response option to any Microsoft DLP incident. Configure the rule as follows:

    -   **Condition:** Integration Source \| contains \| Microsoft
    -   **Applicable for response options:** Block
    -   **Approver:** User Table
    -   **Approver identifier:** Manager
    -   **Number of levels:** 1
    When an analyst selects **Block** on a qualifying Microsoft DLP incident, the system creates an approval request and routes it to the analyst's manager. The response option is applied only after the manager approves.

4.  For the **Approver** option, select **Custom Approval List**.

5.  Select **Submit**.

6.  Verify that the **Approval Levels** related list appears on the form.

7.  In the **Approval Levels** section, select **New**.
