# Create user instructions templates

Create and manage user instructions template for DLP incidents to help the users understand the instructions involved incident resolution and the next steps involved in the resolution process.

## Before you begin

The user instructions card template displays two different headers which provides you more information about a specific incident on the form view.

Role required:

-   sn\_dlir.admin - Create, edit, and delete.
-   sn\_dlir.analyst and sn\_dlir.analyst\_read - View \(read-only\).

## About this task

When an incident is assigned to the end user then the user might be required to know the additional instructions on how to respond to the incidents, introduce the users to the terminology and provide any additional information about the incident. These templates can guide the users to provide the accurate response to the DLP incidents.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **DLP Administration** &gt; **User Instructions Templates**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

To set the order of operation, enter a value. For example, 100, 200, or any other number.

The default is 100.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Incidents that match the defined conditions in the condition builder will be displayed.These conditions are based on the DLP incident data. To build a condition for a user instruction, select any of the incident fields.
