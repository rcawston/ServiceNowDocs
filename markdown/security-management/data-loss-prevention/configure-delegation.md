# Create user delegate configurations

Prevent certain executives in the organization from receiving notifications about the incidents assigned or escalated to them.

## Before you begin

Role required:

-   sn\_dlir.admin - Create, edit, and delete.
-   sn\_dlir.analyst and sn\_dlir.analyst\_read - View \(read-only\).

## About this task

Consider a scenario where the executive is a user who belongs to a leadership or executive group. The executive should not be sent emails about incident assignment or escalation. A delegated user can then take the necessary action on behalf of the executive.

Once a user has assigned a particular person, Henry, as a delegate, another user cannot assign Henry as a delegate again. Similarly, a delegate cannot assign another user as a delegate.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **DLP Administration** &gt; **Delegate Configuration**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |User|Name of the user who needs a delegate for DLP incidents.|
    |Delegate|Name of the user who can respond to the DLP incident on behalf of the original end user.|

4.  Click **Submit**.
