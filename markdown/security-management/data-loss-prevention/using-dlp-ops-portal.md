## Playbook for Data Loss Prevention Incident Response

A Data Loss Prevention Incident Response Playbook is a step-by-step guide for addressing and mitigating data loss incidents, which can include unauthorized exposures, leaks, or breaches of sensitive information that can compromise your organization’s security.

The following table lists the activities and stages available for creating a DLP Playbook. For more information, see [Add a DLP Playbook](using-dlp-ops-portal.md#):

|Activity|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|Detection|Identify and confirm unauthorized access or exposure of sensitive data.|
|Containment|Isolate affected systems or users to prevent further data leakage or unauthorized access.|
|Investigation|Investigate the breach to understand how it occurred, what data was affected, and the potential impact.|
|Notification|Notify internal teams, external stakeholders, and regulatory bodies as required by law or policy.|
|Remediation|Apply corrective measures to address vulnerabilities, update policies, and prevent future breaches.|
|Recovery|Restore systems from secure backups and validate the integrity of data post-incident.|
|Post-Incident Review|Analyze the incident to identify root causes, improve security controls, and strengthen policies.|

The following figure shows the workflow of activities and stages involved in the creation of the Sensitive Data Breach Playbook. Playbook steps vary depending on the workflow.
