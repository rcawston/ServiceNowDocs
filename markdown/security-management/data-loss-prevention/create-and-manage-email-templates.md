# Create email templates

Create and manage the preconfigured email templates for sending notifications to your end users, user groups, or managers. With these templates, you can coach and communicate with your end users about the Data Loss Prevention Incident Response \(DLP IR\) incidents.

## Before you begin

Role required:

-   sn\_dlir.admin - Create, edit, and delete.
-   sn\_dlir.analyst and sn\_dlir.analyst\_read - View \(read-only\).

    **Important:** For Analysts to view email communications of a DLP Incident on the activity stream, you should add or append the 'sn\_dlir.analyst' role in the global system property `glide.ui.activity.email_roles`.


## About this task

Email notifications are categorized by the incident notifications that are sent to the end users, the escalation notifications that are sent to the managers, or the due date notifications. You can send email notifications about the due dates for DLP incidents, or even coach the end users about what to do when certain conditions are met in the email conditions filter.

DLP email templates enable you to send the email notification for end users, managers, and analysts. You can configure the templates to be sent per incident or as a digest. Your email subject and body can contain variables so that you can reuse your existing content.

DLP provides the following preconfigured email templates based on the categories:

-   **DLP Email template - Per incident approval notification:** Notify users about the approval for their requests.
-   **DLP Email template - Escalation notification:** Send escalation notifications to managers in the form of digests.
-   **DLP Email template - Pending approval notification:** Notify approvers about pending items.
-   **DLP Email template - Per incident approval request cancellation notification:**Notify users about an approval request that has been cancelled by DLP analyst team.
-   **DLP Email template - User response completion notification:** Notify DLP analyst team about the response submitted by users.
-   **DLP Email template - User incident notification:**This is a default template for user digest notification. Send incident notifications to the end users in the form of digests every few days, even if there are no new incidents, to inform the users about the total number of incidents on the particular user’s name. You can also send digest notifications to notify the users about the nearest upcoming due dates of DLP incidents with the severity as critical, high, medium, or low.
-   **DLP Email template - Per incident pending approval notification**: Notify approvers about pending approvals.
-   **DLP Email template - rejection notification:** Send reject notification to requester.
-   **DLP Email template - Due date notification:** Send incident due date notification. If a DLP incident is assigned to the end user, and if the end user has not taken any action before the due date, then an email notification is sent to the end user. You also have an option to escalate the DLP incident to a manager, a custom user, or a user group if the response due date has been breached.

    **Note:** Due date notifications must be in the form of digests.

-   **DLP Email template - Per incident user response notification:** Notify analysts about the response submitted users per incident.
-   **DLP Email template - Per incident escalation notification:** Notify managers about escalations per incident.
-   **DLP Email template - Per incident user notification:** Notify users about assignment per incident.
