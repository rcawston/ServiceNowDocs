    **Note:** For the existing customers, we continue to support Basic Authentication to ensure that the existing child tiles which have basic authentication function as expected. However, if a customer wishes to add OAuth to a child tile, they must not remove the existing Basic Authentication credentials \(username and password\). While they can replace these values with dummy entries, leaving the fields empty will prevent the tile from being submitted successfully.

5.  Click **Submit**.


## Result

After you successfully validate and submit the configuration, the Proofpoint DLP Integration is saved on the Security Integrations page as a tile.

Configure a webhook on Proofpoint using the REST API endpoint to start getting the alerts from the Proofpoint DLP tenant. Your ServiceNow instance creates DLP incidents from these alerts. The Proofpoint DLP integration provides a REST API endpoint for end users to configure the webhook.
