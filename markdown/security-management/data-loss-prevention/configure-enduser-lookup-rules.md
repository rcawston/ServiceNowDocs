# Create end user lookup rules

You can create and configure end user lookup rules and assign the DLP incidents to the respective end users based on those rules.

## Before you begin

Role required:

-   sn\_dlir.admin - Create, edit, and delete.
-   sn\_dlir.analyst and sn\_dlir.analyst\_read - View \(read-only\).

## About this task

The DLP admin defines these end user lookup rules to automatically assign the end users to DLP incidents using only the end user field. The DLP end user lookup rule enables you to assign the end user on DLP incidents based on End user identifier, Custom attributes, or Script.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **DLP Administration** &gt; **DLP End User Lookup Rules**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

</td><td>

The end user lookup rule priority. This field indicates the order in which the end user lookup rules are executed when two or more rules share the triggering conditions.The end user lookup rule with the lowest number has the highest priority. To set the order of operation, enter a value. For example, 100, 200, 300, and so on.

The default value is 100.

To add more conditions, click **AND** or **OR**.

-   If **AND** is selected, all conditions must be matched.
-   If **OR** is selected, either condition can be matched.
To set a second filter condition, click **New Criteria**.

</table>    The following example shows an end user lookup rule with the name 'Symantec'. The condition builder requires the 'Integration Source' as 'Symantec'. The **Lookup end user by using** option is set to 'Incident field', and **End user identifier** option is set to 'File Modified by'.

4.  Click **Submit**.

    You also have an option to select one or more end user lookup rules and reapply it on all existing DLP incidents.
