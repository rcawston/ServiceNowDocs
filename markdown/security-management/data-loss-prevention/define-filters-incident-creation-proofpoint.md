# Define filters to apply for the Incident creation

Define and set filter conditions to filter the incoming  Proofpoint DLP  incidents. Control which DLP incidents should be created on ServiceNow®.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_dlir.admin

## About this task

This type of filtering helps you to isolate DLP incidents and to limit the number of DLP incidents that you create. If additional filtering criteria are set, only incidents that match the conditions are created.

## Procedure

1.  Select the **Filter based on conditions** option and define the criteria that an incoming Proofpoint DLP incident must satisfy so that a security incident is created.

2.  Using the lists and fields of the condition builder, set the filters in the **Filter Conditions** field.

    The options in the first field in the **Filter Conditions** matches the fields that are available in the DLP incident. The criteria that you enter are case-sensitive. Verify that the criteria you define match the values of the incident.

3.  Add more conditions by clicking  **AND**  or  **OR**.

    -   If  **AND**  is selected, all conditions must be matched.
    -   If  **OR**  is selected, either condition can be matched.
4.  Click **Finish**.
