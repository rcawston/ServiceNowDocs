# DLP Incidents Archival

The Data Loss Prevention Incident Response is provisioned with one archival rule in the base system for the DLP incident table. The related records are also added in the base system to the DLP incident archive rule.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Archiving** &gt; **Archive Rules**.

    The system archiving rules that are in the base system are displayed.

2.  View the DLP archiving rule.

    **Note:** **DLP Incidents inactive over 15 days** is the default base system archiving rule for DLP incidents. You can modify the archiving rule if necessary. This rule signifies that the incidents that are inactive above 15 days are automatically archived.
