# Create incident response option rules

Create the incident response option rules that end user or analyst can use while responding to an incident.

## Before you begin

Role required:

-   sn\_dlir.admin - Create, edit, and delete.
-   sn\_dlir.analyst and sn\_dlir.analyst\_read - View \(read-only\).

## About this task

You can configure the type of response that an end user should perform based on the type of DLP incident. The base system DLP Incident Response application provides the following response options for users:

-   Assessment Complete
-   Deleted Content
-   Deleted File
-   Encrypted File
-   Masked Content
-   Report false positive
-   Report wrong owner
-   Required for Business Process
-   Reviewed Entitlements

For example, let's say that an end user reports a DLP incident as a false positive. The state for this incident is then automatically marked as closed because the target state that is configured by you is closed.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **DLP Administration** &gt; **Incident Response Option Rules**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

 To set the order of operation, enter a value. For example, 100, 200, or any other number.

 The default is 100.

Conditions in the condition builder. These conditions are based on the DLP incident table. To build a condition for the incident response options, select any of the incident fields.Use the lists and fields of the conditions builder to set the filters for the first row.

 To add more conditions, click **AND** or **OR**:

-   If **AND** is selected, all conditions must be matched.
-   If **OR** is selected, either condition can be matched.
 To set a second filter condition, click **New Criteria**.

**Note:** The conditions in the condition builder are case sensitive.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    The following example shows the end-user action configuration for an endpoint. The condition requires the scan source to be an endpoint file system that then triggers this end-user action configuration. The mapping shows that the report wrong owner, report false positive, and deleted file are the response options available to the end user.

4.  In the **Response Option Mappings** section, click **New**.
