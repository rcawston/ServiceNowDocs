# Approve or reject requests in the Security Exposure Management Workspace

Approve or reject requests that are submitted by remediation owners.

Additional information

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

False positive approvals

</td><td>

One

</td><td>

-   sn\_vul.false\_positive\_approver granular role for vulnerable items \(VITs\).
-   sn\_vul.app\_false\_positive\_approver role for application vulnerable items \(AVITs\)
-   sn\_vul\_container.false\_positive\_approver role for container vulnerable items \(CVITs\)
-   sn\_vulc.false\_positive\_approver for configuration test results

 Or

 Approvers are required to be in the False Positive Approver user group.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Exception approvals \(deferrals\)

</td><td>

Two

</td><td>

-   One approver is required in the Approver - Level 1 group
-   One approver is required in the Approver - Level 2 group

</td><td>

An exception request for a record or remediation task is approved by using a default, two-level approval workflow. The exception request requires two levels of approvers. After the request is approved by the level 1 approver, it’s sent on to the second-level approver and is then visible in approver 2's queue.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Unassign approvals

</td><td>

One approver is required in the Approver – Level 1 group

</td><td>

-   sn\_vul.unassign\_approver for AVITs and VITs
-   sn\_vul\_container.unassign\_approver for CVITs
-   sn\_vulc.unassign\_approver for configuration issues \(CIs\)

</td><td>

**Note:** By default, an approval configuration is provided and an unassign approval group is created. Users \(Unassign Approver - Level 1\) of this group can approve the request. This group contains an unassign approver role, sn\_vul.unassign\_approver, by default. You can modify or create a new group and update the approval configuration. To configure approval rules, navigate to the respective Approval Rules module, select any of the following approval rules, and navigate to the approval configuration in the **Approval Configurations** tab:

-   **Vulnerable item field change request** for a vulnerable item.
-   **Vulnerability field change request** for a remediation task.
-   **Application vulnerability field change request** for an application vulnerable item \(AVIT\).
-   **Approval for container management** for a container vulnerable item \(CVIT\).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Risk reduction approvals

</td><td>

Two

</td><td>

-   One approver is required in the Approver - Level 1 group
-   One approver is required in the Approver - Level 2 group

</td><td>

The approval flow for risk reduction is same as the exception approvals \(deferrals\).

</table>See [Vulnerability Response personas and granular roles](vulnerability-response/vr-persona-overview.md#) and [Assign the Vulnerability Response persona roles using Setup Assistant](vulnerability-response/vr-assign-personas_SA.md) for more information about assigning persona roles to users and users to groups.

**Note:**

-   Starting with v30.3.3 of Exception Management for USEM and v26.6.2 of Vulnerability Response, approvers can select multiple requests at once and approve or reject them in a single action, rather than handling each request individually.
-   Add users to the approval groups before you submit approval requests. If you create requests before you add users to the approval groups, the requests might not be visible to those users that have the approval permission.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Security Exposure Management**.

    If an approver doesn’t have access to the workspace, approvals can be processed at **Vulnerability Response** &gt; **My Approvals** in the classic environment.

2.  Select the List view icon \(![LIst view icon.](../../vulnerability-response/image/icon-polaris-list-workspace.png)\).

    The List page is displayed.

3.  In the Approvals filtered list, select **Assigned to me**.

4.  Locate a request that you want to process and then select the link in the State column.

    The Vulnerability State Change Approval record \(VCA\#\) is displayed.

5.  Choose one of the following options to approve or reject the request.
