# Configuring auto-close rules

By configuring auto-close rules, you can automate the process of closing stale detections and findings associated with retired configuration items \(CIs\).

The base system provides the following auto-close rules:

-   **Assets last scanned**: Detections associated with assets that haven’t been scanned within the last 90 days are transitioned to Stale state.
-   **Detections last found**: Detections that haven’t been found within the last 90 days. If you activate Detections last found record, then this feature requires a successful integration run of Rapid7 Comprehensive Vulnerable Item Integrations and Microsoft TVM Machine Vulnerabilities Integration \(Full import\) within the last seven days.

Starting with v30.3.3 of USEM parallel processing for auto close rules is supported. Previously, auto close rules ran as a single sequential job. With parallel processing, the system automatically creates multiple concurrent jobs based on data volume, significantly reducing execution time for large datasets. When you enable an auto close rule, the system evaluates the number of applicable items and determines the number of parallel jobs to create automatically. Parallelism is configured in code and requires no manual setup.

Configuration of auto-delete rules includes the following steps.

## Create or edit auto-close rules

Create rules to close stale detections and findings associated with retired configuration items \(CIs\) automatically.

### Before you begin

Role required: See [Access control lists \(ACLs\) for administration rules](sem-acls-for-admin-rules.md)

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Security Exposure Management Workspace**.

2.  Select **Administration** in the navigation pane.

3.  Select **Review** on the **Auto-close rules** tile.

4.  On the Rules page, select **Auto-close** in the navigation pane.

5.  Select **New** and fill in the fields on the form:

<table id="table_vks_thr_ns"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="2">

Details

</td></tr><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

Name of the rule.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Table

</td><td>

Name of the finding type for which the rule is being applied.**Note:** For vulnerable items \(VITs\), rules are applied to detections first, and then applied to the VITs, rather than being directly applied to the VITs.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Description

</td><td>

Description of the rule.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Indicates whether the rule is active.

Filter conditions defining the records in the Findings and Remediation Task tables to which the rules apply.

Then do this

</td></tr><tr><td>

Ignored deferred items

</td><td>

If selected, any findings or detections that are mapped to the **In-review** or **Deferred** states are ignored and not closed. If you clear this option, any findings or detections that match your criteria are closed.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>6.  Select **Save**.

    The **Auto-Close Rule Processor** scheduled job runs daily. It identifies findings based on the specified conditions and transitions the matching ones to the **Closed** state and **Stale** substate.

    The job handles the following scenarios:

    -   When all detections within a VIT are marked as Stale, the VIT closes with a substate of "Stale."
    -   If at least one detection remains open alongside others in a Stale substate, the VIT stays open.
    -   When detections carry both "Closed" and "Stale" status, the VIT closes with a substate of "Fixed."
    -   Based on specified conditions, application vulnerable items \(AVITs\) and Test results are marked Closed with the substate Stale.
    -   Based on specified conditions, container vulnerable items \(CVITs\) are marked Closed with the substate Fixed. Any related container image findings are subsequently moved to Closed status as well.
    When you upgrade to the latest version of Unified Security Exposure Management, the conditions set in your auto-close rules also get updated accordingly. Additionally, if the rules are associated with different domains, the rules are created specifically within those domains.
