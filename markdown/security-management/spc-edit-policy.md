# Edit an activated policy in Security Posture Control

You can edit activated policies to help you customize their conditions to better match your assets.

## Before you begin

You cannot edit the policies that are included with the application, but you can clone and create child policies from them. See [Clone a policy or create a child policy in Security Posture Control](spc-clone-policy.md).

If you edit policies and publish your changes, versions are tracked and version numbers are displayed on the policy record and its related test results.

Before you edit an activated policy, you might prefer to deactivate it so that the policy does not continue to evaluate your assets while you edit.

Roles required: SPC Admin Group or SPC Analyst Group

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Security Posture Control** &gt; **List** &gt; **Policies** &gt; **All**.

2.  Select a policy record to open it.

3.  Select **Edit policy**.

    If you are editing for the first time, two deactivated buttons are displayed next to the active **Exit edit mode** button: **Save changes** and **Publish changes**. If you have previously edited this policy and saved it as a draft, the notification, `You have an unpublished edit` is also displayed.

4.  Make your edits and choose one to continue.

Save changes

</td><td>

Save your changes as a draft and return to editing mode. Your changes are not published at this point, and you can return to the policy and continue editing later.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Publish changes

</td><td>

Publish your changes as a new version of the policy and automatically exit edit mode. It may take some time for findings to display on your new version of the policy on the View findings button on the policy.

If you publish a new version of a policy, you have the option to close any existing findings for the policy that you changed. You might prefer to close any existing findings from the original policy if you only want to view findings for your changed policy.

If you cancel at this point or exit edit mode, a message is displayed that you have an unpublished edit for this policy.

If you choose to close its existing related test results \(findings\), test result and remediation task states transition in accordance with the state transition processes of the Configuration Compliance application. See [Test result and remediation task state transitions in the Security Posture Control application](spc-findings-state-transition.md) for more information.
