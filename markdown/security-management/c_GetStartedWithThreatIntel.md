# Set up Threat Intelligence

Before you run Threat Intelligence in your instance, you must download it from the ServiceNow Store. You can also set up properties and define a threat source.

## Install Threat Intelligence

Before you run Threat Intelligence in your instance, you must download it from the ServiceNow Store.

### Before you begin

Complete the following setup checklist prior to installation. These setup tasks are required for a smooth installation and configuration.

<table id="table_sir_install_dependencies"><thead><tr><th>

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Verify that you have the required ServiceNow roles for your instance.

</td><td>

The following roles are required for installation, configuration, and verification of expected results:-   If not already assigned, the System Administrator \[admin\] installs the application and assigns the Threat Admin \[sn\_ti.admin\] role.
-   The Threat Admin \[sn\_ti.admin\] oversees configuration and verifies expected results.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>Role required: admin

### Procedure

1.  Follow the instructions for [downloading an application from the ServiceNow Store](download-app-first-time.md).


### What to do next

[Set Threat Intelligence properties](c_GetStartedWithThreatIntel.md#).

### Components installed with Threat Intelligence

Several types of components are installed with activation of the Threat Intelligence plugin, including tables and user roles.

**Note:** The Application Files table lists the components that are installed with this application. For instructions on how to access this table, see [Find components installed with an application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/find-components.md).

## Define a threat source

You can maintain a list of Threat Intelligence threat sources. Each source includes the ability to define how often a source is queried. You can also execute a threat source on demand to import the needed Structured Threat Information eXpression \(STIX\) data.

### Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ti.admin

### About this task

Threat Intelligence employs two technologies for importing threat-related information: STIX and Trusted Automated Exchange of Indicator Information \(TAXII\).

STIX provides a standardized, structured language for representing an extensive set of cyberthreat information that includes indicators of compromise \(IoC\) activity \(for example, IP addresses and file hashes\), as well as contextual information regarding threats, such as attack modes/methods, that together more completely characterize the motivations, capabilities, and activities of a cyber adversary. As such, STIX data provides valuable information on how your organization can best to defend against cyberthreats.

Trusted Automated Exchange of Indicator Information \(TAXII\) is used to facilitate automated exchange of cyberthreat information. TAXII defines a set of services and message exchanges that enable sharing of actionable cyberthreat information across organization and product/service boundaries for the detection, prevention, and mitigation of cyberthreats. TAXII profiles can be set up as repositories for sharing STIX-formatted information. Each profile contains one or more TAXII collections or feeds.

### Procedure

</table>5.  Fill in the fields in the **Threat Details** section, as appropriate.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Indicator|The indicator to use when the data doesn’t explicitly provide one. For blocklists, if empty, a new indicator is created for each observable.|
    |Indicator type|The indicator type to use for indicators that are created and the data doesn’t explicitly provide an indicator type.|
    |Attack Mode/Method|The attack mode/method to use when the data doesn’t explicitly provide one.|

    |Weight|Enter a weight value for this source to be used in the confidence calculation.|

    **Note:** The usage of the **Indicator**, **Indicator Type**, **Attack Mode/Method**, and **Observable Type** fields are implementation-specific. The default processor, SimpleBlocklistProcessor, behaves as the tooltips describe. However, a TAXII threat source is fully data driven. Any custom threat source processor would be able to use its own strategy. These fields are basically items to expose to the integration/processor and the implementation decides how to use them.
