# Create security tag rules

Security tag rules provide filtering for security tag access.

## Before you begin

-   Security tags added by rules are removed automatically when rule conditions no longer match.
-   Manual security tags are preserved when automatic tags are applied.
-   When multi-selection is disabled for a security tag group, only one tag from that group can be applied to a security incident. If a security analyst manually applies a tag and an automatic tagging rule subsequently triggers for a different tag within the same group, the automatic tag overrides the manual tag.
