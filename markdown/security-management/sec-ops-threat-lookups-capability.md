# Security Operations Integration - Threat Lookup capability

The **Threat Lookups** capability performs threat intelligence lookups to determine whether one or more observables are associated with known security threats.

The **Threat Lookups** capability has a workflow, [Security Operations Integration - Threat Lookup Flow](sec-ops-integ-threat-lookup.md). When the capability workflow runs, it executes additional workflows for the activated implementations. You can specify an implementation to use to perform a lookup on the selected observables, or you can perform the lookup using all implementations.

**Note:** If no implementations are available, capability actions are not displayed in product menus.

-   **[Security Operations Integration - Threat Lookup Flow](sec-ops-integ-threat-lookup.md)**  
The **Security Operations Integration - Threat Lookup** capability flow accesses available threat lookup implementations and executes the implementation flows associated with each to perform threat lookups of selected observables.
