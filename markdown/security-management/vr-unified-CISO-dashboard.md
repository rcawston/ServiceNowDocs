# Cybersecurity Executive Dashboard

The Cybersecurity Executive Dashboard is a comprehensive solution that provides high-level executive officers visibility into an organization's security posture, policies, and initiatives.

The Cybersecurity Executive Dashboard application \[sn\_bod\] is available in the ServiceNow® Store. See the dependencies and system requirements that are required for the application on the listing in the ServiceNow® Store.

The Cybersecurity Executive Dashboard provides high-level executive officers comprehensive insights into their organization's security posture. The dashboard integrates data from all products in the Security Operations product suite, including Vulnerability Response, Application Vulnerability Response, Container Vulnerability Response, Configuration Compliance, Security Incident Response, and Major Security Incident Management. Additionally, it incorporates employee readiness data by seamlessly integrating with leading third-party phishing simulation tools such as KnowBe4 and Microsoft Defender for Office365.

The personas the dashboard might support in your organization includes but is not limited to:

-   Chief Risk Officers \(CRO\)
-   Chief Information Officers \(CIO\)
-   Chief Privacy Officers \(CPO\)
-   Chief Executive Officers \(CEO\)
-   Members of the Board of Directors, Audit Committees, outside counsel and other executives.

The dashboard provides the following features:

-   Consolidates data from various applications into a single view of your organization's overall security posture that includes vulnerabilities, configuration compliance, security incidents, and employee readiness.
-   Aggregated view of security metrics from various Security Operations products.
-   Organization-wide security posture scoring.
-   Business unit-specific risk assessments and a pinning feature for prioritizing top business units.
-   Customizable dashboard for personalized monitoring.
-   Integration with third-party tools for phishing simulation data \(KnowBe4 and Microsoft Defender for Office365\).
-   Target setting and KPI tracking capabilities.
-   Peer benchmarking.

The target adherence is determined by the number of items that have fulfilled the set target. \(\[\[Test Result SLA - Passed Count &gt; Remediation status \(unified\) = Target Met\]\] + \[\[Container SLA - Closed Count &gt; Remediation status \(unified\) = Target Met\]\] + \[\[Application SLA - Closed Count &gt; Remediation status \(unified\) = Target Met\]\] + \[\[Host SLA - Closed Count &gt; Remediation status \(unified\) = Target Met\]\]\) / \(\[\[Test Result SLA - Passed Count\]\] + \[\[Container SLA - Closed Count\]\] + \[\[Application SLA - Closed Count\]\] + \[\[Host SLA - Closed Count\]\]\) \* 100

-   **Monthly Remediation Efficiency \(All Vulnerable Items\)**

    Calculates the monthly percentage of closed vulnerable items, containers vulnerable items, and application vulnerable items in contrast to newly identified ones. var closedItems = \[\[Host SLA - Closed Count\]\] + \[\[Container SLA - Closed Count\]\] + \[\[Application SLA - Closed Count\]\] + \[\[Test Result SLA - Passed Count\]\];

    var newItems = \[\[Host VITs opened/reopened yesterday\]\] + \[\[Container VITs opened/reopened yesterday\]\] + \[\[Application VITs opened/reopened yesterday\]\] + \[\[Test results opened/reopened yesterday\]\];

    var res = 0;if \(closedItems == 0\) res = 0;else if \(newItems .=0\)res = closedItems / newItems \* 100;if \(res &gt; 1000\) res = 1000; res;

-   **Host VITs opened/reopened yesterday**

    This indicator is calculated daily. It considers the host vulnerable items that were last opened on the previous day at the time of calculation.

-   **Application VITs opened/reopened yesterday**

    This indicator is calculated daily. It considers the application vulnerable items that were last opened on the previous day at the time of calculation.

-   **Container VITs opened/reopened yesterday**

    This indicator is calculated daily. It considers the container vulnerable items that were last opened on the previous day at the time of calculation.

-   **Test results opened/reopened yesterday**

    This indicator is calculated daily. It considers the test results that were last seen on the previous day at the time of calculation.

-   **OT Vulnerable Items**

    This indicator is calculated daily. It considers active OT vulnerable items present at the time of calculation.

-   **OT Summed Duration of Closed Vulnerable**

    This indicator is calculated daily. It considers the total age of all OT vulnerabilities that are closed on the day of calculation.

-   **OT Closed Vulnerable Items**

    This indicator is calculated daily. It considers the OT vulnerable items that are closed on the day of calculation.

-   **Average age of OT active vulnerable items**

    Calculates the average age of OT vulnerable items \(\[\[Summed age of OT vulnerable Items\]\] / \[\[OT Vulnerable Items\]\]\)
