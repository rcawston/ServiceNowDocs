# Security Operations Integration - CI Enrichment flow

The Security Operations Integration - CI Enrichment flow allows you to enrich data in configuration items \(CI\) associated with a security incident.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_si.analyst

## About this task

This flow is triggered from Security Incident Response in two ways.

-   by selecting one or more CIs from the **Configuration Items** tab \(under the **Affected Items** related link\) and selecting **Run CI enrichment** from the **Actions on selected rows** choice list.
-   by opening a CI record and clicking the **Run CI enrichment** related link.

Either method then allows you to specify which implementations to be used to enrich the selected CIs. The associated implementation flows are executed to perform the enrichment.

**Note:** The base system does not include an implementation flow for this capability. To enrich CIs, you must create your own implementation [flow](../build-workflows/legacy-workflow/c_WorkflowOverview.md).
