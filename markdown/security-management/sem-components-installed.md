# Security Exposure Management Workspace Components

When you activate the Unified Security Exposure Management \(USEM\) and Security Exposure Management Workspace applications, the system installs specific key components including tables, user roles, and scheduled jobs to support the operations required for assessing and managing security exposures.

The following applications install Security Exposure Management-specific components:

-   Unified Security Exposure Management
-   Security Exposure Management Workspace
-   Administration for Security Exposure Management
-   Risk Scoring for Security Exposure Management
-   Remediation for Attack Surface Management
-   Exception Management for Unified Security Exposure Management

USEM also depends on components provided by some existing security operations applications. For details of those existing components, see:

-   [Components installed with Vulnerability Response](vulnerability-response/installed-with-vr.md)
-   [Components installed with Application Vulnerability Response](application-vulnerability-response/installed-with-avm.md)
-   [Components installed with Container Vulnerability Response](container-vulnerability-response/installed-with-cvr-data.md#)
-   [Components installed with Configuration Compliance](configuration-compliance/installed-with-config-compliance.md)

To view the full list of installed components, use the Application Files table. For instructions, see [Find components installed with an application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/find-components.md).

## Deprecated Components

Some tables and scheduled jobs from the existing security operations applications are not included in USEM, as they have been deprecated.

The following tables from the existing applications have been deprecated and have corresponding replacements or references in USEM.
