# Run a sightings search on observables in a case

You can search for observables using the Sighting Search feature to determine how often they occur. Each occurrence is considered a sighting. You can limit the search to the number of sightings within a selected number of days or within a date range.

## Before you begin

The Threat Intelligence plugin must be activated to use Security Case Management.

Role required: sn\_ti.case\_user\_write

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Threat Intelligence** &gt; **Case Management** &gt; **All Cases**.

2.  Open the case that contains observables for which you want to run a sightings search.

3.  Click the **Case Artifacts** related link.

4.  Click the **Observables** tab.

5.  Select one or more observables for which you want to search for sightings.
