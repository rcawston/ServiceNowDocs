# Security Operations Integration - Enrich Observable flow

The Security Operations Integration - Enrich Observable sub flow allows you to enrich observables with additional information from a variety of sources using implementation flow designer.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_si.analyst

## About this task

This flow can be triggered from either Security Incident Response or Threat Intelligence in two ways.

-   by selecting one or more observables from the Observables list and selecting **Run observable enrichment** from the **Actions on selected rows** choice list.
-   by opening an observable record and clicking the **Run observable enrichment** related link.

Either method then allows you to specify which implementations to be used to enrich the selected observables. The associated implementation flows are executed to perform the enrichment.

Actions specific to this flow are described here. For more information on other actions, see [Common Security Operations integration flows and orchestration activities](common-wf-activities.md).

The flow process actions include:

-   [Capability Execution Tracking- No Impls action](execution-tracking-noimpls-activity.md)
-   [Get Supported Security Capabilities action](get-supported-security-capabilities-activity.md)[Capability Execution Tracking- No Impls action](execution-tracking-noimpls-activity.md)
