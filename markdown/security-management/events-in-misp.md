# Managing events in MISP

You can create events in MISP automatically or manually from the ServiceNow AI Platform. You can also edit the event data in MISP from the ServiceNow AI Platform.

**Parent Topic:**[Using MISP to investigate and analyze threats](using-misp-to-detect-and-analyze-threats.md)

## Verifying automatically created events in MISP

You can verify the automatically created events after you configure the event creation profile in your ServiceNow AI Platform instance.

### Automatic event creation profile

[Configuring the automatic event creation profile](configure-automatic-event-creation-profile.md#) is done by the sn\_si.admin or the sn\_ti.admin user roles in the **MISP Integration** &gt; **Automatic Event Creation Profiles** module.

### Viewing the MISP event data

You can view the created events in the following ways:

-   View the work notes for the created events. You can view the event details in the ServiceNow AI Platform instance and also as it appears in the MISP server as shown in the following example.

    ![View the work notes for created events.](../image/misp-event-creation-worknotes.png "Work notes for created events")

-   Click the [Associated MISP Events](associated-misp-events.md) related list. Here, you can view the event in relation to the security incident and the MISP resources as shown in the following example.

    ![View the list of associated events](../image/misp-associated-event-list.png "List of associated events")

-   View the MISP event data in the form view to review the detailed information about the MISP events as shown in the following example.

    ![View the event data in the form view to see the detailed MISP event information.](../image/misp-event-data-form-view.png "Event data in the form view")


## Manually create an event in MISP

Manually create events in MISP from the ServiceNow AI Platform to capture contextually related information represented as attributes and objects.

### Before you begin

-   [Review the MISP user role and permissions](misp-user-roles-and-permissions.md) for using the MISP bi-directional features.
-   Role required: sn\_sec\_misp.write

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Security Incident** &gt; **Show All Incidents**.

2.  Select the security incident that contains the observables that you want to create an event for.

3.  Click **Create a new event in MISP**.

4.  In the Create a new event in MISP dialog box, fill in the details.
