Role required:

-   sn\_vul.remediation\_owner for host vulnerable items \(VITs\)
-   sn\_vul.app\_security\_champion for application vulnerable items \(AVITs\)
-   sn\_vul\_container.remediation\_owner for container vulnerable items \(CVITs\)
-   sn\_vulc.remediation\_owner for configuration test results \(CTRs\)

        -   Select the **Solutions** tab to see preferred and potential solutions for a host remediation task.
        -   Select the **Details** tab to modify editable fields such as State, Assignment group, Assigned to, and Short description and view the actions performed on a remediation task.
