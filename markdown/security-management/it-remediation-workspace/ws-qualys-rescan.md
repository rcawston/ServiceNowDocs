# Rescan Qualys vulnerable items from the Vulnerability Response workspaces

Verify that your vulnerable items have been remediated between scheduled scanning cycles. Initiate rescans in the Qualys product on-demand from the IT Remediation Workspace in your ServiceNow AI Platform instance.

## Before you begin

To initiate a rescan for the Qualys product from the classic environment, see [Initiate rescan for the Qualys Vulnerability Integration](../vulnerability-response/advanced-modifications.md#).

The Qualys scanners are deactivated by default in the Vulnerability Response application. If you try to perform a rescan from the vulnerable items or remediation tasks that have these applications as a source, the **Rescan** button is not available.

To activate these scanners, as a user with the sn\_vul.vulnerability\_admin role:

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Vulnerability Response** &gt; **Vulnerability Scanning** &gt; **Scanners**.
2.  Locate the scanner product you want to activate and click the record to open it.
3.  Select the Active check box.
4.  Click **Update**.

    The product you activated is displayed in the Source field on vulnerable item and remediation task records after the next import, and **Rescan** is available as a UI action.


For more information about setting up your Qualys scanner, see [Set up scanner appliances](../vulnerability-response/advanced-modifications.md#) and [Advanced Qualys configurations and modifications](../vulnerability-response/advanced-modifications.md#).

-   You can initiate rescans on-demand for vulnerable items and remediation tasks that have the Qualys product as the source from the IT Remediation Workspace in your ServiceNow AI Platform.
-   On a remediation task record, the record can be in any state other than **Closed**, and all the associated VIs must be from the Qualys product.
-   To initiate rescans in the IT Remediation workspace from vulnerable item and remediation task records, these records must be assigned to you.

Roles required:

-   sn\_vul.remediation\_owner for the IT Remediation Workspace.
-   sn\_vul.vulnerability\_analyst or sn\_vul.vulnerability\_admin from the Vulnerability Manager Workspace.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to a vulnerable item or a remediation task that has been assigned to you and open it.

    **Note:** If you choose a remediation effort to initiate a rescan, all the VIs associated with that record are scanned.

2.  In the upper right of the record, click **Rescan**.

3.  In the Rescan modal, choose an option profile.

    An option profile is required when you initiate a Qualys scan from your ServiceNow AI Platform®. Option profiles contain Qualys scan settings.

This is the option profile that is set as the default for the integration instance. You select this profile when you set up your Qualys scanner. See [Set up scanner appliances](../vulnerability-response/advanced-modifications.md#) for more information.

From the Option profile list, choose a profile to use for the scan.You can select the option profile you want to use for scans for matching configuration items.

</table>4.  In the Rescan modal, click **Request rescan**.

    The message, `The scan request is being processed` is displayed.

5.  Click the **View status** link in the message to view the progress of the scan.

    The scan record \(VSCAN\#\) displays. Below the record header with the scan number, the related item lists display the following information:

    -   The Details list displays the scan number of the parent scan, the scanner source, and the state. View completed and failed scans under the Scan Summary section.
    -   The Scans list displays any child scans and their states. When all the child scans are completed, the state of the parent scan transitions to Complete.
    -   The Source list displays the vulnerable item used for the scan, the associated configuration item and vulnerability, the state of the VI, and its remediation status.
    Your ServiceNow AI Platform® instance tracks the rescan status until it successfully completes, or, until the set tracking period times out, whichever happens first.

    The time-out does not stop the scan. The time-out refers to when the ServiceNow AI Platform® stopped tracking your rescan status, not when the actual rescan stopped.

    All VIs that have transitioned, or will transition, to Closed/Fixed are imported with the next scheduled import of the Qualys integrations.
