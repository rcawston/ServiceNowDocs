# List page in the IT Remediation Workspace

The List view in the IT Remediation Workspace permits remediation owners to view the records \(VITs, AVITs, CVITs, and TRs\) assigned to them and their assignment groups, and remediate these vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. You can also view the list of preferred solutions that are recommended for remediating the host vulnerable items \(VITs\). Along with these lists, you can view the list of exception requests and penetration test assessment requests raised by you, penetration test findings associated with your penetration test assessment requests, supported libraries and other supported data.

Roles required:

-   sn\_vul.remediation\_owner for host vulnerable items \(VITs\)
-   sn\_vul.app\_security\_champion for application vulnerable items \(AVITs\)
-   sn\_vul\_container.remediation\_owner for container vulnerable items \(CVITs\)
-   sn\_vulc.remediation\_owner for configuration test results \(CTRs\)

The lists and links on the List page provide you with easy access to records and tasks. It contains two tabs:

-   **Lists** tab: Displays the default lists for remediation efforts, remediation tasks, vulnerable items \(VITs, AVITs, or CVITs\), solutions, exceptions, and configuration test results \(TRs\), etc. For more information, see the following table.
-   **My Lists** tab: Displays any list that you’ve renamed from the List tab and any list that you create.

    You can also create your own list of records. For more information, see [Create a list in the IT Remediation Workspace](vr-ws-IT-list-view.md).


**Tip:**

If the **sn\_vul\_cmn\_ws.navigate\_to\_workspace** system property is set to `true` by the admin, upon selecting the predefined filter links in the Vulnerability Response, Application Vulnerability Response, Container Vulnerability Response, and Test Results module in Configuration Compliance under the **All** menu, these links open in the List page in the IT Remediation Workspace.

For example, if you select **Assigned to My Groups** by navigating to **All** &gt; **Vulnerability Response** &gt; **Remediation Tasks** &gt; **Assigned to My Groups**, this link is redirected to the IT Remediation Workspace. The Assigned to my group list in the Remediation Tasks module opens in the List page of the IT Remediation Workspace if you have a remediation owner role. To view the host remediation tasks, group the tasks by **Record Type**.

You can hide the record count on a list using the **glide.ui.list.seismic.omit.count** system property. For more information on how to turn off/on the record count display on a list, see the [KBB0010402](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KBB0010402) KB article.
