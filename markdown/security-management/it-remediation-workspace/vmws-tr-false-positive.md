# Request a false positive for a set of test results

Raise a false positive request for a set of test results within a remediation task in the IT Remediation Workspace.

## About this task

The following conditions must be met for you to request a false positive for a set of test results within a Remediation Task:

-   Version 22.0 of Vulnerability Response must be installed.
-   At least one selected test result must be in the Active state
-   The remediation task must have at least two test results
-   At least one test result is unselected

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_vulc.remediation\_owner

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **IT Remediation Workspace**.

2.  Select the List icon \(![List icon](../../secops-analyst-workspace/image/listview-icon.png)\).

3.  On the List page, select the Configuration Compliance Remediation Task.

4.  In the Overview related list, under the Test Results tab, select the test results that you want to mark as false positive.

5.  Select the **Mark as False Positive** button on the Configuration Test Results tab.

6.  In the dialog that is displayed, enter information about the request and select **Request Approval**.

7.  On the Take Questionnaire modal, answer the questions to provide additional information about your request to the approver and select **Submit**.

    **Note:** The Take Questionnaire modal appears only when the **Enable questionnaire to mark false positive** check box is selected in the Exception Management Configuration form. For more information on how a questionnaire is configured, see [Configure Exception Management for Configuration Compliance](../configuration-compliance/configure-exception-management-configuration-compliance.md).


## Result

The selected test results are moved to a new remediation task and your request is submitted for approval. The task number appears in the **Activity stream** of the old Remediation Task. The approver receives an email notification about your request.

You will receive an email notification on the approval or rejection of your request. In the **Activity stream** of a test result or remediation task, you can view the entire workflow of the false positive request.

## What to do next

1.  In the IT Remediation Workspace, on the List page, navigate to **Exception Requests** &gt; **My requests**.
2.  Open the corresponding state change approval record \(VCA\#\) and check the status of your request in the Approval state column:

    |Approval state|Result|
    |--------------|------|
    |Approved|The State of the new remediation task transitions to Closed with Reason as False positive.|
    |Rejected|The state of the new remediation task changes to Open.|

3.  After the request is approved, navigate to the Details tab of the new Remediation Task, and set the expiry date for false positive in the **Until** field if necessary.

    The remediation task will revert to the Open state after the specified date and the State is rolled down to the test results.
