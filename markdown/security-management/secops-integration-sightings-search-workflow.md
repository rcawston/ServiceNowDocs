# Security Operations Integration - Sightings Search Flow

**Security Operations Integration - Sightings Search** flow is a high-level flow independent of integrations. It uses the configured queries to search for a set of observables based on the configured integrations which support the capability. Use it to fulfill an integration such as Splunk or Elasticsearch.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_si.analyst

## About this task

If a security incident has an observable attached to it, this flow is triggered when you click on **Run Sighting Search** in the **Actions on selected rows...** drop-down menu in the **Security Incident Observables** tab.

Activities specific to this flow are described here. For more information on other activities, see [Common Security Operations integration flows and orchestration activities](common-wf-activities.md).

-   **[Sightings Search - Determine Observables activity](determine-observables-sightings-search-activity.md)**  
The **Sightings Search - Determine Observables** workflow activity determines which observables to include in the workflow.
-   **[Persistent Observable Sightings activity](persistent-observable-sightings-activity-arcsight-wf.md)**  
The **Persistent Observable Sightings** workflow activity retrieves observables from the third-party integration.
-   **[Get Observable Sightings Queries activity](get-observable-sightings-queries-activity.md)**  
The **Get Observable Sightings Queries** workflow activity retrieves queries from the integration configuration.
