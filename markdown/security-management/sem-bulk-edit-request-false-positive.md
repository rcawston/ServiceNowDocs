# Bulk edit for false positive in the Security Exposure Management Workspace

Mark one or more records \(VITs, AVITs, CVITs, or TRs\) as false positive concurrently using the bulk edit feature from the Security Exposure Management Workspace instead of manually selecting each item.

## Before you begin

Role required:

-   sn\_vul.vulnerability\_analyst, sn\_vul.vulnerability\_admin, or sn\_vul.remediation\_owner for host vulnerable items \(VITs\)
-   sn\_vul.app\_sec\_manager, sn\_vul.app\_security\_champion for application vulnerable items \(AVITs\)
-   sn\_vul\_container.vulnerability\_analyst, sn\_vul\_container.vulnerability\_admin, or sn\_vul\_container.remediation\_owner for container vulnerable items \(CVITs\)
-   sn\_vulc.admin, sn\_vulc.remediation\_owner for configuration test results \(CTRs\)

## About this task

When you raise a false positive request for one or more records from the Bulk edit modal, a remediation task is created with the selected records.

**Note:** When you raise a false positive request for the Application Vulnerable Items \(AVITs\) using the bulk edit feature, the AVITs from the scanners with the **Manage False positive with Servicenow** parameter set to false are not updated.

-   If you select AVITs from various scanners, some with the **Manage False positive with Servicenow** parameter set to true and other set to false, the AVITs linked to the scanners with the **Manage False positive with Servicenow** parameter set to false are not updated.
-   If you select AVITs from only the scanners with the **Manage False positive with Servicenow** parameter set to false, the False positive option does not appear in the **Reason** field in the Bulk Edit modal.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Security Exposure Management Workspace** &gt; **List**.

    **Note:** The selected records must be in the Open, Under Investigation, or Awaiting Implementation state.

2.  On the List page, open Active or All list in one of the following lists:

    -   Host Vulnerable items
    -   Container Vulnerable items
    -   Application Vulnerable items
    -   Configuration Test Results
3.  Perform one of the following:

    -   Select the check box next to each item if you want to use the Only Selected Items option in the [**Record selection**](vulnerability-manager-workspace/vmws-bulk-edit-request-false-positive.md#record-slection-field) field.
    -   Apply filters if you want to use the All records that match filter option in the [**Record selection**](vulnerability-manager-workspace/vmws-bulk-edit-request-false-positive.md#record-slection-field) field.
4.  Select the **Bulk Edit** button.

5.  On the form, fill in the fields to request false positive for multiple records.

7.  On the Take Questionnaire modal, answer the questions and select **Submit**.

    A remediation task is created with the selected records. Your request is submitted for approval and the State of the remediation task changes to  In Review.

    **Note:** The **Take Questionnaire** modal appears only when the questionnaire is enabled for false positive requests in the Exception Management form. For more information on configuring a questionnaire for false positive requests, see [Configure Exception Management for Vulnerability Response](vulnerability-response/configure-exception-management-settings.md), [Configure Exception Management for Application Vulnerability Response](application-vulnerability-response/configure-exception-management-application-vulnerability-response.md), and [Configure Exception Management for Container Vulnerability Response](container-vulnerability-response/configure-exception-management-for-container-vulnerability-response.md).

    The approver receives an email notification about your request.


## Result

In the Security Exposure Management Workspace, on the List page, navigate to **Exceptions** &gt; **All**, open the corresponding state change approval record \(VCA\#\) and check the status of your request in the Approval state column:

|Approval state|Result|
|--------------|------|
|Approved|The state of the Remediation Task transitions to Closed with the Reason as False positive. The state and reason are rolled down to the records.|
|Rejected|The state of the Remediation Task and its records doesn’t change.|

In the **Activity stream** of a record or remediation task, you can view the entire workflow of your request.
