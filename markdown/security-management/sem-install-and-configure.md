# Install Unified Security Exposure Management

Before you run the Unified Security Exposure Management application in your ServiceNow AI Platform instance, you must get entitlement and download the application from the ServiceNow Store and install it on your ServiceNow AI Platform instance.

## Before you begin

**Note:** This process applies only to applications that are downloaded to production instances. If you're downloading applications to non-production or development instances, it's not necessary to get entitlements. Proceed to [Activate a ServiceNow Store application](activate-entitled-store-app.md).

-   Verify that you have the required ServiceNow roles assigned for your instance.
-   The admin role is required for installation and assigning roles.

**Important:** Unified Security Exposure Management \(USEM\) is a major architectural upgrade to Vulnerability Response applications. If you are currently using Vulnerability Response and upgrading to USEM for the first time, you must use the Migration assistant for Unified Security Exposure Management to ensure a successful upgrade.

For detailed information, refer [KB2556844](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2556844) and [Migrating from Vulnerability Response to Unified Security Exposure Management \(USEM\)](vulnerability-response/migrating-to-usem.md) before proceeding.

Role required: admin
