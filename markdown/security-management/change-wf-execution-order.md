# Change the order of flow execution

Integration capability implementations specify the flow to be executed. In the base system, flows are executed sequentially, in the order specified in the implementation. You can change the order as needed.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_sec\_cmn.write

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Security Operations** &gt; **Integrations** &gt; **Integration Capabilities**.

2.  Select the integration capability for which you want to change the execution order.

    ![Integration Capability Implementations showing the execution order](../../security-operations-integrations/image/change-order.png)

3.  Select the implementation you want to modify.

4.  Change the **Order** to a higher or lower number.

    Lower numbers have a higher execution priority.

5.  Click **Submit**.
