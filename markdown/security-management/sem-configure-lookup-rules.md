# Configuring lookup rules

By configuring lookup rules, you can map security exposure data to the correct configuration items \(CIs\) in the CMDB. This mapping is a critical function because associating exposure findings with the right assets is essential for proper risk assessment, assignment, and remediation workflows.

## Create lookup rule

Create lookup rules to automatically and accurately associate incoming exposure findings data with the correct configuration items \(CIs\) in the Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\) This is essential for enabling the rest of the vulnerability management process to function correctly.

### Before you begin

Role required: sn\_vul.vulnerability\_admin

### About this task

Creating lookup rules requires advanced ServiceNow and Unified Security Exposure Management \(USEM\) expertise. Rather than modifying one of the existing lookup rules, consider copying it and modifying the copy. When you are satisfied that the new rule does what you want, deactivate the original.

**Note:** Rules, once removed, cannot be recovered. Rather than removing existing rules, deactivate them when creating new ones.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Security Exposure Management Workspace**.

2.  Select **Administration** in the navigation pane.

3.  Select **Review** on the **Look-up rules** tile.

4.  On the Rules page, select **Look-up** in the navigation pane.

5.  Select **New**.

6.  On the form, fill in the fields.

## Ignore CI classes

To ignore some configuration item \(CI\) classes, for example Load Balancer \[cmdb\_ci\_lb\], when running lookup rules, set the **ignoreCIClass** \[**sn\_sec\_cmn.ignoreCIClass**\] system property.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

**Note:**

The **ignoreCIClass** system property is available starting with Vulnerability Response v9.0. However, the property functionality is not available upon upgrade from any previous version.

If you have upgraded from any Security Operations application, prior to version 9.0, see [KB0788209](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0788209) for instructions on how to enable this functionality.

### Procedure

1.  Enter `sys_properties.list` in the left navigation bar.

2.  Click **Enter**.

3.  In the **Search** menu, under **Name** enter `sn_sec_cmn.ignoreCIClass`.

4.  In the **Value** text box, enter the CI classes to exclude in a comma-separated list.

    ![ignoreCI Class system property example.](../../security-operations-common/image/ignoreCIClass.png)

5.  Click **Update**.

    This list is used by CI Lookup Rules during the next import. Vulnerable items created during import are not associated to a CI of any type listed in the **Value** field of the `sn_sec_cmn.ignoreCIClass` system property.


## Reapply lookup rules

Reapply lookup rules to ensure updated or existing rules are applied to relevant items. This helps maintain accurate data mapping and consistency after rule changes or additions.

### Before you begin

Role required: sn\_vul.vulnerability\_admin, sn\_vul\_cmn.usem\_admin, sn\_vul.app\_sec\_manager, sn\_vul\_container.admin, sn\_vulc.admin

### About this task

Reapplying lookup rules is useful when:

-   Look-up rules are updated or newly created.
-   Findings were previously unassigned or incorrectly assigned.
-   You must reassign ownership based on updated business logic or CI ownership changes.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Security Exposure Management Workspace**.

2.  Select **Administration** in the navigation pane.

3.  Select **Review** on the **Look-up rules** tile.

4.  On the Rules page, select **Look-up rules** in the navigation.

5.  Select **Reapply**.

    **Note:** All the rules are reapplied regardless of any filters.

[Reapply lookup rules on selected discovered items](sem-configure-lookup-rules.md#)

## Reapply lookup rules on selected discovered items

Reapply the lookup rules on selected discovered items from the discovered item list view select actions. If the configuration item \(CI\) changes after you reapply the rules, the discovered items are updated with the new CI and impacted detections. Vulnerable items are also updated.

### Before you begin

Roles required: admin

### About this task

For more information, see [CI changes for discovered items](vulnerability-response/reapply-discovered-items-ci-changes.md).

For more information on the concepts of CI matching and the CMDB, discovered item lookup, rule-based identification, see the [CI matching in Vulnerability Response \[KB0998706\] article](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0998706) in the HI Knowledge Base.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Security operations** &gt; **CMDB** &gt; **Discovered Items**.

2.  Select the required discovered items and select **Action on selected rows**.

    ![Reapply CI lookup rules on Discovered Items.](../../vulnerability-response/image/reapply-action-di.png)

3.  From the list, select **Reapply CI lookup rules**.

    **Note:** You can skip the reapplication of lookup rules on discovered items with the substate ‘CI Decommissioned’ by enabling the system property **sn\_sec\_cmn.skipItemsWithCIDecommissioned**.

    The rules are reapplied on these discovered items.

4.  Select **View status** in the message.

    The status displays on the background job form.

    **Note:** In the **Notes** field, the `Discovered items could not be process due to exception` attribute with a non-zero value indicates that there’s an error or exception while reapplying a look-up rule. Check the system logs for more details.

5.  Reapply only applies to items scanned within the last 90 days based on the **last\_scan\_date, last\_comp\_scan\_date, non\_infra\_last\_scan\_date, non\_infra\_last\_comp\_scan\_date** column.

    Added ci\_lifecycle\_status\_source \(scope = sn\_sec\_cmn\) system property for configuring CI lifecycle status columns \(for example, Install Status, Operational Status\). You can configure additional columns for retiring CIs.

    Columns are added to the background job list view:

    -   Elapsed Time\(ms\): The time required for processing the background job.
    -   Items Processed: The number of items processed until now.
    -   Total Items to be Processed: The total number of items remaining to be processed.
    -   Time Until Completion\(ms\): The time remaining until the background job is processed. These columns provide visibility into job progress. These columns are available for each form view for you to add according to requirement.
