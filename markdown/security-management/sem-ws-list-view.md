As a vulnerability manager, security manager and analysts, you can view remediation progress on records, drill down into findings, and view the status of their approval requests and exceptions.

## Before you begin

Role required:

-   sn\_vul.vulnerability\_analyst, sn\_vul.vulnerability\_admin, or sn\_vul.remediation\_owner for host vulnerable items \(VITs\)
-   sn\_vul.app\_sec\_manager, sn\_vul.app\_security\_champion for application vulnerable items \(AVITs\)
-   sn\_vul\_container.vulnerability\_analyst, sn\_vul\_container.vulnerability\_admin, or sn\_vul\_container.remediation\_owner for container vulnerable items \(CVITs\)
-   sn\_vulc.admin, sn\_vulc.remediation\_owner for configuration test results \(CTRs\)

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Security Exposure Management**.

2.  Select the **List** icon.

    The consolidated list of records, remediation tasks, remediation efforts, libraries are displayed. For more information on the type of lists on the List page, see [Security Exposure Management Workspace List view](sem-workspace-list-page.md).

 A Remediation Effort is a set of records that are associated with a watch topic. The records listed on a remediation effort are static. They are not updated by new import data or changes that you make to watch topics.

 The related list items on the remediation effort record permit you to view overall remediation progress and status on the records associated with it. For more details and UI actions you can perform from a remediation effort, see [Use Remediation Effort records](sem-ws-remed-eff-rcd.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

To the left of the Number column with a list displayed, roll over a row and select the small information icon **\(i\)** for a record.

</td><td>

Details about the records are displayed in the right side panel of the page. Details include:-   Assignment group
-   Vulnerability
-   Assigned to
