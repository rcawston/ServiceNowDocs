# Configuring remediation target rules

By configuring remediation target rules, you can set the expected time frame for addressing findings, similar to how service level agreements \(SLAs\) set deadlines for fixing vulnerabilities.

The base system ships with three remediation target rules that are applicable only for application vulnerable items:

-   **Critical Risk Rating Rule**: A remediation target with a 1-Critical risk rating, a remediation target of 15 days, and a reminder of 7 days before the target date.
-   **Less Critical Risk Rating Rule**: A remediation target with either a 2-High or 3-Medium risk rating a remediation target of 30 days, and a reminder of 7 days before the target date.
-   **Medium-High RIsk Rating Rule**: A remediation target with a 4-Low risk rating a remediation target of 45 days, and a reminder of 7 days before the target date.

These rules are inactive by default. If you choose to edit one, rather than create a new one, remember to check the Active box before saving.

## Create or edit remediation target rules

Create remediation target rules to ensure the timely remediation of high-risk vulnerabilities by setting up a remediation target rule at the findings level.

### Before you begin

Role required: See [Access control lists \(ACLs\) for administration rules](sem-acls-for-admin-rules.md)

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Security Exposure Management Workspace**.

2.  Select **Administration** in the navigation pane.

3.  Select **Review** on the **Remediation target rules** tile.

4.  On the Rules page, select **Remediation target** in the navigation pane.

5.  Select **New**.

6.  On the remediation target rule form, enter the required details.

    For a full description of each field, see [Remediation target rule fields](vulnerability-response/sem-rt-rules-fields.md).

7.  Select **Save**.

    This rule goes into effect during the next run of the scheduled job, **Evaluate remediation targets** or when using the **Reapply** button on the Remediation target rules list view. The same is true when an existing rule is updated.

### Recalculate a remediation target date

The remediation target \(RT\) date defines when a finding must be remediated. Recalculation verifies that RT dates stay accurate and reflect the latest risk rating updates. When a finding’s risk rating changes, the system can recalculate RT dates using the most recent update date, helping maintain accurate SLAs and avoid outdated or overdue target dates.

#### Before you begin

**Note:** By default, recalculation applies only to findings that aren’t overdue. To include overdue findings in the recalculation, enable the **sn\_sec\_cmn.evaluate\_targetmissed\_records** system property.

Role required: admin

#### About this task

Recalculate remediation target date 

#### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Security Exposure Management** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Remediation Target Rules**.

2.  Open an existing rule to make updates.

    If you need to create a new rule, select **New**.

    For instructions, see [Create or edit a Vulnerability Response remediation target rule](vulnerability-response/create-time-to-remediate-rule.md).

3.  Choose how the system should recalculate the remediation target \(RT\) date when the risk rating changes.

    -   In Workspace, this option appears in the Recalculate target date section
    -   In Classic view, use the **Target recalculation method** field.

#### Examples of recalculating a remediation target date

The following examples show how the system recalculates the remediation target date based on different rule selections and risk rating changes.

**Note:** By default, SLAs define the remediation window for each risk level:

-   Low risk: 30 days
-   Medium risk: 15 days
-   High risk: 10 days
