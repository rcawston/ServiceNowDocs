# Security Operations Carbon Black Integration - Isolate Host Flow

The Security Operations Carbon Black Integration - Isolate Host is the implementation for the Carbon Black integration launched by the Security Operations Integration - Isolate Host flow.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_si.analyst

## About this task

The flow process activities include:

-   [Execution Tracking - Begin \(CIs\) Flow Action](execution-tracking-begins-cis-activity.md)
-   [Get IP from CI](get-ip-from-ci-activity.md)
-   [Collect Carbon Black configurations](collect-cb-config-activity.md)
-   [Capability Execution Tracking- Failure Flow Action](capability-execution-tracking-failure.md)
-   [Get Sensor ID](get-sensor-id-activity.md)
-   [Set Network Isolation Enabled activity](../reference/set-network-isolation-enabled-activity.md)
-   [Update Sensor](update-sensor-activity.md) - returns Isolate Host result.
-   [Capability Execution Tracking - Complete Flow Action](capability-execution-tracking-complete.md)

Activities specific to this flow are described here. For more information on other activities, see [Common Security Operations integration flows and orchestration activities](common-wf-activities.md).

-   **[Get Sensor ID Flow Action](get-sensor-id-activity.md)**  
The Get Sensor ID flow action gathers sensor identifiers to use in the flow.
-   **[Set Network Isolation Enabled activity](../reference/set-network-isolation-enabled-activity.md)**  
The Set Network Isolation Enabled workflow activity enables network isolation.
-   **[Update Sensor activity](update-sensor-activity.md)**  
The Update Sensor workflow activity updates the sensor to isolate hosts or endpoints.
