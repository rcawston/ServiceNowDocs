# View an IoC

IoCs, sometimes referred to as indicators, are most typically retrieved from a threat data source as STIX data. If needed, you can also create IoCs.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ti.write

## Procedure

1.  After the scheduled job has retrieved IoC data from the [defined data source](c_GetStartedWithThreatIntel.md#), navigate to **Threat Intelligence** &gt; **IoC Repository** &gt; **Indicators**.

    The retrieved IoCs are listed.

2.  Click the IoC you want to view.

3.  The following information displays.

<table id="table_dsg_w5w_yt"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Select classification tag

</td><td>

If you set up and activated [security tags](create-class-group-and-tags.md) to add metadata to the record, you can select one or more tags to specify the degree of sensitivity of the IoC. If you did not set up or activate security tags, this drop-down list is not displayed.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Title

</td><td>

A descriptive name for this indicator.

</td></tr><tr><td>

First Seen

</td><td>

The first date this indicator was observed in the system.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Last Seen

</td><td>

The most recent date this indicator was observed in the system.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Encountered count

</td><td>

The number to times the indicator has been encountered.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Sourced count

</td><td>

The number to times the indicator was imported from defined threat sources.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Notes

</td><td>

Any additional notes about the indicator. This field can also contain JSON key/value pairs.
