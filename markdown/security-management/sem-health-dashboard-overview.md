# Security Exposure Management Workspace Health dashboard

The Vulnerability Response Health dashboard is a tool designed to empower organizations with comprehensive insights into the implementation and usage of their Security Exposure Management applications.

The overall health assessment is determined by aggregating various critical factors across configuration, implementation, integration, performance, data, and process. View the aggregate dashboard for each category for the following applications:

-   Vulnerability Response
-   Application Vulnerability Response
-   Container Vulnerability Response
-   ​Configuration Compliance​

## Installing the SecOps Vulnerability Response Health Dashboard

To install and configure the SecOps Vulnerability Response Health Dashboard for Vulnerability Response applications in your ServiceNow AI Platform instance, navigate to the ServiceNow® Store and activate the SecOps Health Analytics \(sn\_sec\_analytics\) plugin.

## Required ServiceNow AI Platform roles

Roles required: sn\_sec\_analytics.admin, sn\_sec\_analytics.read

## Scheduled job

To view the scheduled job, navigate to **All** &gt; **System Scheduler** &gt; **Scheduled Jobs** &gt; **Collect health dashboard metrics**. The 'Collect health dashboard metrics' scheduled job is run daily at 00:00 hours. It generates the data for the SecOps Vulnerability Response Health dashboard. You can choose to run the scheduled job manually as well.

## Accessing the SecOps Vulnerability Response Health Dashboard

To access the SecOps Vulnerability Response Health Dashboard,

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Security Exposure Management Workspace**.

2.  Select the **Dashboards** icon.

Vulnerability admin

</td><td>

Helps you gain an understanding of the health score of the Unified Security Exposure Management applications. It’s also helpful to highlight the areas that need improvement. The Vulnerability Response Health Dashboard deals with the implementation and usage health only. It doesn’t assist with management of findings.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Support admin

</td><td>

Helps you to identify the performance, customization, and configuration issues using KPIs. Based on the application health, you can perform an extra analysis or provide a recommendation to the users.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Implementation partner
