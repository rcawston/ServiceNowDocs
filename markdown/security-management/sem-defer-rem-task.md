# Defer a Remediation task

If you identify a finding or remediation task for which a fix is not yet available and can be safely deferred without additional analysis, you can use the **Request Exception** feature.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_sec\_exception.admin

## About this task

You can defer a finding or remediation task directly from its respective form in the Security Exposure Management workspace. Once submitted, the request is sent for approval.

A scheduled job runs every day checking for deferred remediation tasks that have reached their reopen date. On the day the task's deferral is set to expire, the task is reopened.

**Note:** You can manually move change requests and remediation tasks through the states of their life cycles on their respective records with state synchronization enabled, but when the system registers that a CHG has changed its state, or you add a CHG or remove it from a remediation task, state synchronization potentially can override your manual intervention. However, change request states do not automatically move remediation tasks from the Closed or Deferred states.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Security Exposure Management Workspace** &gt; **List** &gt; **Remediation Tasks**.

2.  Open a record.

3.  Click **Request Exception**.

4.  Fill in the fields on the form, as appropriate.

Select the date when the Defer state expires and the remediation task is reactivated.

 After the record is submitted, if [email notifications](vulnerability-response/t_DefineEmailNotifications.md) are defined, members of the group receive an email when the expiration date is within one week. When the defer date expires, the remediation task is set back to **Open** and a second email notification is sent out.
