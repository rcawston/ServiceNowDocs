# Create a case from IoCs or observables

In Threat Intelligence, you can create a case from artifacts \(IoCs or observables\). After the IoCs or observables have been used to create a case, you can use Security Case Management to analyze the data.

## Before you begin

The Threat Intelligence plugin must be activated to use Security Case Management.

Role required: sn\_ti.case\_user\_write

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the artifacts \(IoCs or observables\) you want to use to create a case.

    -   To create a case from IoCs, navigate to **Threat Intelligence** &gt; **IoC Repository** &gt; **Indicators**.
    -   To create a case from observables, navigate to **Threat Intelligence** &gt; **IoC Repository** &gt; **Observables**.
2.  In the list, select the artifacts you want added to a new case.

    **Note:** If you select multiple IoCs or observables, they are all added to the case.

3.  From the **Actions on selected items** drop-down list, select **Add to Security Case**.

    The **Add to Security Case** dialog box opens. If you already have cases assigned to you, they display in the list.

4.  Click **Create New Case**.

5.  Fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Case Name|Enter a name for this case.|
    |Description|Enter a description that would be of value to the case analyst.|

6.  Click **Submit**.

    A message at the top of the list indicates that a new case has been created, along with a link to the case in Security Case Management.

7.  Click the link to view the new case.
