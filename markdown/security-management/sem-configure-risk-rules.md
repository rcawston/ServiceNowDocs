## Create or edit roll-up calculator rules

Create rules to roll-up risk scores on imported findings and remediation tasks.

### Before you begin

Role required: See [Access control lists \(ACLs\) for administration rules](sem-acls-for-admin-rules.md)

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Security Exposure Management Workspace**.

2.  Select **Administration** in the navigation pane.

3.  Select **Review** on the **Roll-up calculator rules** tile.

4.  On the Rules page, select **Roll-up calculator** in the navigation pane.

5.  Select **New** and fill in the fields on the form:

<table id="table_vks_thr_ns"><thead><tr><th>

</td></tr><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

Name of the rule.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Target table

</td><td>

Name of the table from which the risk score must be rolled-up.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Target field

</td><td>

Name of the field from the table that must be considered for risk roll-up.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Active

</td><td>

Indicates whether the rule is active.

</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">

Source selection

</td></tr><tr><td>

Applies to

</td><td>

The finding table to which the risk score roll-up applies to.

 The **Applies to** field is dependent on the selected target table, and its options are updated accordingly. For instance, choosing the Container remediation task \[sn\_vul\_container\_vulnerability\] limits the **Applies to** field options to Container vulnerable item. This dynamic update ensures that only relevant options are available based on the target table selected.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Roll-up calculations

</td></tr><tr><td>

Basic

</td><td>

Assign weightage to specify the relative impact of each of the following factors on the rolled-up risk score:-   **Maximum risk score**: Maximum risk score of the findings considered.
-   **Average score**: Aggregate of the risk scores of all the findings.
-   **Count of records**: Number of findings. A larger number of findings increases the overall score, while a smaller number lowers it.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Script \(Advanced option\)

</td><td>

The scripting feature is an advanced feature to build a custom script that should return the risk score, which is an integer value ranging from 0 to 100.
