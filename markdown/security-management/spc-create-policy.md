# Create and activate custom policies for Security Posture Control

Create your own custom policies to monitor assets for tool coverage and other high-risk combinations.

## Before you begin

To help you understand the steps required to create a policy with more details, refer to [Examples of base, child, and cloned policies for Security Posture Control](spc-policy-examples.md). The examples walk you through the steps required to create a base policy, use the base policy to create a child policy, and clone a policy.

For example policies, see [Examples of base, child, and cloned policies for Security Posture Control](spc-policy-examples.md).

Roles required: SPC Admin Group or SPC Analyst Group

    |Entity option|Entity description|
    |-------------|------------------|
    |**Hardware**|Locate IP devices that include personal computing devices, cloud virtual machines, servers, network devices, and other hardware.|

6.  Choose none, one or both.

    |**Exclusion policies**|Select any policies you want to exclude from the asset findings for this policy. Any findings from these policies are ignored.|

    The Connection and Entity fields are displayed.

7.  Select one from the list for the Connection field.

    The target Entity field is auto populated based on your choice. A new Criteria field is displayed along with Property, Operator, and Value fields. For more information about asset types and the schema for relationships, see [Policies for Security Posture Control](spc-policies-overview.md).

8.  Select one from the list for Property.

9.  Select **Category** or **Source**.

10. Select an operator and enter a connector category, for example, Endpoint management, or a category product name \(source\).

11. Use the condition builder and add more conditions or condition sets.

    You navigate from the top-level asset types for hardware and software to their secondary entities by using the condition builder. Depending on your choices, fields are displayed for you and you modify or add criteria.

    The AND, OR decorators in the condition builder permit you to set up the logic for the returned data you want returned for the policy. Refer to the following table and image for more information.

    |Decorator|Description|Number referenced in the image|
    |---------|-----------|------------------------------|
    |Select **AND** next to the top-most Connection and Entity fields for new set of conditions.|Adds a logical AND between the current Connection-Entity criteria, and new criteria from another Connection-Entity.|1|
    |Select **AND** to the right of a Criteria or Property field for new set of Criteria and Property conditions.|Adds a logical AND between the current Connection-Entity criteria, and a new criteria under the same Connection-Entity.|2|
    |Select **OR/AND** to the right of a Property field for new set of Property conditions.|Adds a logical OR/AND between current Property, and a new Property from the same Connection-Entity-Criteria.|3|
    |Select **+ New condition set** for a new set of conditions.|Adds a logical OR between the Condition Set of all current Criteria, and a new Condition Set.|4|
