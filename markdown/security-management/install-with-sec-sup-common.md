# Components installed with Security Support Common

Several types of components are installed with Security Support Common. They provide common functionality for use across the various security applications, such as Security Incident Response.

## Locating and viewing installed components

See [View components installed with Security Support Common](installed-with-secops-common-NEW.md) more information about locating and viewing installed components.

**Note:** The Application Files table lists the components that are installed with this application. For instructions on how to access this table, see [Find components installed with an application](../platform-administration/find-components.md).

## View filtered lists for components installed with an application

Filter the Applications Files table so that only the roles, scheduled jobs, and tables that are installed with an application are displayed. The application you want to view these components for should be installed so that its files are loaded onto the instance and into the metadata table. Follow these steps to view filtered lists from the Applications Files table.

1.  In the filter navigator, enter **sys\_metadata.list** to navigate to the metadata table.
2.  Select the condition builder \(filter icon\), and select, **Application** &gt; **is** followed by the name of your application.
3.  In the condition builder, to add a second filter, click **AND**, then select, **Class** &gt; **is a** and choose one of the following classes from the list: **Role**, **Scheduled job**, or **Table**.
4.  Select **Run**.

The results for the class you selected are displayed in a filtered list.
