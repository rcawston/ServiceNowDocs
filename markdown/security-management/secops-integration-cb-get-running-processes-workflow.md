Actions specific to this flow are described here. For more information on other actions, see [Common Security Operations integration flows and orchestration activities](common-wf-activities.md).

-   **[Collect Carbon Black Configurations Flow Action](collect-cb-config-activity.md)**  
The Collect Carbon Black Configurations flow action gathers configuration information to use in the flow.
-   **[Check MID Server Status](check-mid-server-status.md)**  
Determines whether the MID Server identified in the **MID Server Host** field of the integration's configuration is up and running. If the field is set to **Any**, the flow action verifies that any MID Server is up and running.
-   **[Get Sensor ID Flow Action](get-sensor-id-activity.md)**  
The Get Sensor ID flow action gathers sensor identifiers to use in the flow.
-   **[Create Session Flow Action](create-session-activity.md)**  
The Create Session flow action establishes a Carbon Black session to use in the flow.
-   **[Check Session Status Flow Action](check-session-status-activity.md)**  
Determines the status of a Carbon Black session within the flow.
-   **[Create Command Process Flow Action](create-command-process-activity.md)**  
The Create Command Process flow action create a Carbon Black command process to use in the flow .
-   **[Check Command Status and Get Process Flow Action](check-command-status-get-process-activity.md)**  
Checks the Carbon Black command status and retrieves processes to use in the flow.
-   **[Map Processes Data Flow Action](map-processes-data-activity.md)**  
The Map Processes Data flow action maps Carbon Black process data within the flow.
-   **[Capability Execution Tracking - Complete Flow Action](capability-execution-tracking-complete.md)**  
The Capability Execution Tracking - Complete flow action updates the audit record when the flow is complete.
-   **[Close Session Flow Action](close-session-activity.md)**  
Closes a Carbon Black session within the flow.
