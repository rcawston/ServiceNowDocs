# Create an operating system group

Operating system groups are used to map an operating system to specific process types and scripts in Security Incident Response workflows. The scripts define how running processes for the defined operating system groups are retrieved. New operating systems can be added as needed.

    The base system includes scripts for three operating systems:

    -   BSD-based OS
    -   POSIX-based OS
    -   Windows OS
2.  Select **New**.
