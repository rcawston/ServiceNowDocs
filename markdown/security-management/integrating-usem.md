# Unified Security Exposure Management integrations

Unified Security Exposure Management supports multiple third-party integrations to help with vulnerability management, orchestration and remediation. This section provides guidelines for managing and developing integrations.

## How integrations work

Integrations work in the following way:

1.  Vulnerability entries are imported from the National Vulnerability Database \(NVD\), Central Vulnerability Database and third-party scanners.
2.  Detection data from third-party scanners are matched against assets in your Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\).
3.  When a match is found, a finding is created.
4.  The findings are then:
    -   Grouped into remediation tasks.
    -   Risk-scored with business context.
    -   Prioritized and assigned to the appropriate teams.

The following table provides a list of Unified Security Exposure Management integrations created by ServiceNow® and partners.

</table>## Custom integrations

You can manually create integrations not available in the ServiceNow Store. See [Manually create a vulnerability integration](vulnerability-response/c_VulnerabilityIntegrations.md) for more information.

## Configuring and managing integrations

-   You can install, configure, schedule, and launch many integration applications.
-   For integrations supporting multiple deployments, refer to [Create domain-separated imports for an integration](vulnerability-response/create-domain-separated-imports.md).
-   The Rapid7 Vulnerability Integration application can be installed from Setup Assistant, but its configuration isn’t supported within Setup Assistant. See [Install the Rapid7 Vulnerability Integration](vulnerability-response/install-and-configure-r7.md) for more information. You can install, configure, schedule, and launch on-demand many of the integration applications from within Setup Assistant.

## Performance and timeout handling

During integration execution, multiple processes are generated, and data is received in the form of pages. Each process can contain one or more import queue entries with attached data in pages. These entries must process the data within the one-hour time limit. However, if the payload size is large, the processing time may exceed one hour or get stuck, resulting in an integration timeout error. The integration continues to process the data despite the timeout error. To avoid this miscommunication, timestamps \(heartbeats\) are sent periodically to indicate if the queue is active and processing data. The **Last Record Processed** field in the Import Queue Entry page is updated based on the count of records the import queue creates or updates. In case an import queue entry exceeds the one-hour time limit, the system checks the **Last Record Processed** field to see if it’s also older than one hour. If it is, this indicates that the import queue entry is stuck, and it’s timed out to prevent any further delays in processing.

**Note:** The **Last Record Processed** field is updated based on what is defined in the following system properties:

-   **sn\_sec\_cmn.record\_threshold\_heartbeat**: Defines the number of processed records, after which the heartbeat \(timestamp\) is sent to the import queue entry.
-   **sn\_sec\_cmn.maximum\_heartbeat\_delay**: Defines the time after which the import queue entry must be timed out.

-   **[Review Unified Security Exposure Management integrations](review-usem-integrations.md)**  
The integration dashboard provides an overview of the installed third-party applications and the status of the integration runs.
