# View webhook batches

A webhook batch record is created for each webhook execution.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

In order to reduce the number of API calls sent to the webhook endpoints, batching of events is implemented in webhooks. For each webhook, if there are multiple events triggered almost during the same time, then all these events are sent as part of the same request to the webhook endpoint.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Threat Intelligence Security Center** &gt; **Administration**.

2.  Select **Webhooks Configurations** &gt; **Webhooks**.

    The Webhooks page displays.

3.  Select the webhook.

4.  Go to **Error Logs**.

5.  View the error logs.

    The list view shows all the error logs from one particular webhook.

6.  Go to **Batch** column.

7.  Click on any **Batch ID**.

    The Webhook Batch page is displayed.

    **Note:** All the batches are stored in the table `sn_sec_tisc_webhook_batch`.

    Below is the sample payload format that the webhook end point receives:

    ```
