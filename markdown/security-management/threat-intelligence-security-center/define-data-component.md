# Define Data Component

Define a data component to identify the properties or values of a data source

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_sec\_tisc.analyst

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Threat Intelligence Security Center**.

2.  Click on **Threat Intel Library** icon on the workspace.

3.  Go to **Data Component** object.

4.  Click **New**.

    **Note:** Whenever you create new object records for observables, indicators, entities or objects a source record is created and a prompt message is displayed that the new object record is created and then the user is redirected to the aggregated record.

5.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |ID|Unique ID to identify a Data Component.|
    |Name|A name used to identify the Data Component.|
    |Description|A description that provides more details and context about the vulnerability, potentially including its purpose and its key characteristics.|
    |Data Source|Indicates the normalized degree of severity of this vulnerability|
    |TLP|TLP is used to ensure that sensitive information is shared with the appropriate audience. It employs four colors \(White, Green, Amber, and Red\) to indicate different degrees of sensitivity.|
    |Source|Specifies the threat source from which this object record is created.|
    |Confidence|Indicates the confidence for this object. The confidence must be between 0-100.|
    |Revoked|Indicates that the revoked objects are no longer considered valid by the object creator.|

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Notes|Add any additional notes for this Data Component.|

</td></tr><tr><td>

Lang

</td><td>

This property identifies the language of the text content in this object.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Created Time In Source

</td><td>

Specifies the time the object is created in the source.

</td></tr><tr><td>

</table>6.  Click **Save**.

    After you save, a prompt message is displayed indicating that A new observable record is created. Click **Continue** to edit the record and create new relationships.

7.  Click **Continue**.

    **Important:** After you create a new observable record, **Prevent System Updates** check box is displayed.

    Select this check box to prevent any updates from the system after the observable or indicator or STIX objects records are created.

## What to do next

Click any of the following related lists to view additional information about objects associated with the Data Component.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Attack Patterns|Lists the attack patterns associated with this object.|

**Note:**

1.  You can link and unlink the related records associated with this object. For more information, see [Link Threat Intel Related Records](link-threat-intel-releated-records.md).
2.  The various SDOs within the TI library also contains the potential relationships. To establish a relationships between any two objects, you use the **Potential Relationships** link from the **Threat Intel Library** to confirm the relationships between the objects. For more information, see [Confirm object-object potential relationships](define-object-object-potential-relationships.md).
3.  Also, use the **Related Records** section from the objects form view to confirm the relationships between two Objects using the **Potential Relationships** section available on the form view. For more information on see, [Confirm Potential Relationships from Related Records](confirm-potential-relationships.md).
4.  You can add objects to cases. For more information, see [Add to Case](add-to-case.md).
