# Add artifacts to case\(s\) or case task\(s\)

After you have created a case, you can view or add artifacts, such as security incidents, CIs, and indicators of compromise, to the case. These artifacts act as clues in solving the case.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

**Note:** Artifacts are available only to the existing cases. For observables and indicators, the artifacts can also be added or associated to a case from the import job using the Import Intelligence button. For more information on how to import see, [Import Intelligence in TISC](importing-threat-intelligence.md)

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Threat Intelligence Security Center**.

2.  Click **Threat Analyst Workbench** icon.

3.  Go to **Case Management** &gt; **All Cases**.

    All the cases are displayed.

4.  Select any case or case task.

5.  Go to **Artifacts** tab.

    The associated artifacts are displayed as the related lists for that specific case or case task.

6.  Link or Unlink the records from the case or case task.

    **Note:** For more information, see [Link Threat Intel Related Records](link-threat-intel-releated-records.md)

    Following table lists the artifacts related lists related to the case\(s\) or case task\(s\):
