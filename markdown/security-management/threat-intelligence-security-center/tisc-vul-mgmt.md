# Vulnerability Management Support

Learn how a new vulnerability is created in TISC with a related vulnerability in VR.

## Before you begin

Role required:

-   System Administrator \(view, create or edit\)
-   sn\_sec\_tisc.admin \(view\)

## About this task

When new vulnerability is created in TISC and there is a related vulnerability in VR.

-   If VR vulnerability\(v2\) score is &gt; 8 OR VR vulnerability\(v3\) score is &gt; 8.
-   Total VI’s associate to it are greater than 0.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Threat Intelligence Security Center** &gt; **Administration**.

2.  Select **Automated Flows**.

3.  Select **Vulnerability Management Support** action link to view the respective rule details in the flow designer.

4.  View the flow designer action for the following trigger:

    ```
    When new vulnerability is created in TISC and there is a related vulnerability in VR.
    ```

5.  **If the percentage of total VI’s remediated that are associated to that vulnerability is 100%, then:**

    1.  Add a tag called Remediated to the observable.

6.  **Else, enrich the observable data with available capabilities:**

    1.  Create a remediation task for VR.

    2.  Notify the concerned VR team’s regarding it.
