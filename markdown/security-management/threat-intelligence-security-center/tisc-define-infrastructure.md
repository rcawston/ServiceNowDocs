# Define infrastructure

Define an Infrastructure that is any systems, software services, and any associated physical or virtual resources intended to support some purpose of an attack.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_sec\_tisc.analyst

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Threat Intelligence Security Center**.

2.  Click on **Threat Intel Library** icon on the workspace.

3.  Go to **Infrastructure** object.

4.  Click **New**.

    **Note:** Whenever you create new object records for observables, indicators, entities or objects a source record is created and a prompt message is displayed that the new object record is created and then the user is redirected to the aggregated record.

5.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_wtw_tcd_nyb"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

ID

</td><td>

Unique ID for a course of action to prevent an attack.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

Enter a descriptive name for this course of action.When referring to a specific entity \(an individual or organization\), this property must contain the canonical name of the specific entity.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Description

</td><td>

A description that provides more details and context about the Infrastructure, potentially including its purpose, how it is being used, how it relates to other intelligence activities captured in related objects, and its key characteristics.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Infrastructure Types

</td><td>

Describes the categorisation of infrastructure.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Aliases

</td><td>

Alternative names to identify this infrastructure.**Note:** To add new alias which is not existing in the application click on the **Add New Aliases** icon which is available within the Alias field itself.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Attack Phases

</td><td>

Represents attack phase in a kill chain such as LM, MITRE ATT&amp;CK.

</td></tr><tr><td>

TLP

</td><td>

TLP is used to ensure that sensitive information is shared with the appropriate audience. It employs four colors \(White, Green, Amber, and Red\) to indicate different degrees of sensitivity.

</td></tr><tr><td>

First Seen

</td><td>

The time that this infrastructure was first seen performing malicious activities.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Last Seen

</td><td>

The time that this infrastructure was last seen performing malicious activities.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Confidence

</td><td>

Enter the confidence for this course of action.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Source

</td><td>

Specifies the threat source from which this object record is created.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Revoked

</td><td>

Indicates that the revoked objects are no longer considered valid by the object creator.

</td></tr></tbody>

Additional Context

</td><td>

Add any additional context for this infrastructure.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Spec Version

</td><td>

The version of the STIX specification used to represent this object.The value of this property must be 2.1 for STIX Objects defined according to this specification.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Lang

</td><td>

This property identifies the language of the text content in this object.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Created Time In Source

</td><td>

Specifies the time the object is created in the source.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Extensions

</td><td>

Indicates the extensions of attack pattern.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Modified Time in Source

</td><td>

Specifies the time the object is modified in the source.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Processing Status

</td><td>

Represents the processing status of this object, course of action.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Created

</td><td>

Specifies the time when the record is created in the source.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Updated

</td><td>

Specifies the time when the record is modified in the source.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Created By Ref

</td><td>

This property specifies that the identity object that describes the entity had created this object.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>6.  Click **Save**.

    After you save, a prompt message is displayed indicating that A new observable record is created. Click **Continue** to edit the record and create new relationships.

7.  Click **Continue**.

    **Important:** After you create a new observable record, **Prevent System Updates** check box is displayed.

    Select this check box to prevent any updates from the system after the observable or indicator or STIX objects records are created.

**Note:**

1.  You can link and unlink the related records associated with this object. For more information, see [Link Threat Intel Related Records](link-threat-intel-releated-records.md).
2.  The various SDOs within the TI library also contains the potential relationships. To establish a relationships between any two objects, you use the **Potential Relationships** link from the **Threat Intel Library** to confirm the relationships between the objects. For more information, see [Confirm object-object potential relationships](define-object-object-potential-relationships.md).
3.  Also, use the **Related Records** section from the objects form view to confirm the relationships between two Objects using the **Potential Relationships** section available on the form view. For more information on see, [Confirm Potential Relationships from Related Records](confirm-potential-relationships.md).
4.  You can add objects to cases. For more information, see [Add to Case](add-to-case.md).
