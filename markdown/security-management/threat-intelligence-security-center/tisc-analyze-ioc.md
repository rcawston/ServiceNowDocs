# Analyze and assess threat IoC’s

Learn how to analyze an IOC’s which are a threat and notifying the security incident team.

## Before you begin

Role required:

-   System Administrator \(view, create or edit\)
-   sn\_sec\_tisc.admin \(view\)

## About this task

Whenever a sighting search enrichment is requested:

-   if the observable is sighted \(count &gt; 0\) and
-   Observable Reputation is Malicious and
-   Observable Threat score is &gt; 80 and
-   Observable Confidence &gt; 80

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Threat Intelligence Security Center** &gt; **Administration**.

2.  Select **Automated Flows**.

3.  Select **Analyze, assess the IoCs related to the threat and create incident** action link to view the respective rule details in the flow designer.

4.  View the flow designer action for the following trigger:

    ```
    Sighting Created where (Sighting count greater than 0, and Observable. Reputation is Malicious, and Observable. Threat Score greater than 80, and Observable. Confidence greater than 80)
    ```

5.  **If Sighting Created where \(Sighting count greater than 0, and Observable. Reputation is Malicious, and Observable. Threat Score greater than 80, and Observable. Confidence greater than 80\), then:**

    1.  Create an security incident and add the observable to the incident.

    2.  Add Observables to Security Incident V1.

    3.  Send an email communication.
