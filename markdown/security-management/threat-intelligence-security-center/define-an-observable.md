# Define an Observable

Observables can be retrieved from scheduled feed ingestion or from the import assistant. However, you can create observables, as needed.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_sec\_tisc.analyst

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Threat Intelligence Security Center** &gt; **Threat Intel Library** &gt; **Observables** &gt; **All Observables**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  Select the **Observable Type**.

    Create New Observable record form is displayed.

    **Note:** Whenever you create new object records for observables, indicators, entities or objects a source record is created and a prompt message is displayed that the new object record is created and then the user is redirected to the aggregated record.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    **Note:** Whenever you either create a new observable or view the existing observables, the **Attachments** pane is by default displayed on the form view. You can either click the Attachments icon on the right-contextual menu or go to **Preferences** &gt; **Workspaces** and disable the **Show the sidebar**. For more information, see [Configure Next Experience Workspace preferences](https://servicenow.com/docs/bundle/washingtondc-platform-user-interface/page/get-started/servicenow-overview/task/next-experience-workspace-preferences.html).

</table>    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Resolves To|Specifies a list of references to one or more IP addresses or domain names that the domain name resolves to.|
    |Is FQDN|A fully qualified domain name\(FQDN\) is the complete address of an internet host or computer. It provides its exact location within the domain name system \(DNS\) by specifying the hostname, domain name and top-level domain \(TLD\).|

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Threat Level|Indicates the threat level of the observable record.|
    |First Seen|The time that this observable record was first seen performing malicious activities.|
    |Threat Severity|Indicates the threat severity of the observable record.|
    |Last Seen|The time that this observable record was last seen performing malicious activities.|
    |Usage Categories|Categories that the observable falls under, such as botnet or phishing.|
    |Attack Phases|Represents attack phase in a kill chain such as LM, MITRE ATT&amp;CK.|
    |Additional Context|Add any additional context.|
    |Sources|Specifies the threat source from which this record is created.|

    **Important:** **Source Reported Score**: This field contains the aggregated value of threat scores reported by the sources from which the observable is ingested. To see this field on the observable record form, you must add it manually, as it is not available by default.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Resolves To|Specifies a list of references to one or more IP addresses or domain names that the domain name resolves to.|
    |Is FQDN|A fully qualified domain name\(FQDN\) is the complete address of an internet host or computer. It provides its exact location within the domain name system \(DNS\) by specifying the hostname, domain name and top-level domain \(TLD\).|

    **Note:** **Resolves To** and **Is FQDN** attributes are only applicable to the **Domain Name** type of observables.
