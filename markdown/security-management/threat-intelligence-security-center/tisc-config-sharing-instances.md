# Share Threat Intelligence data between TISC instances

You can share threat intelligence data between TISC instances using one of the following methods.

## Sharing Methods

-   **Manual sharing through the user interface \(GUI\)**: Manually curate and share intelligence records with a target instance through the TISC interface. For more information, see [Sharing of Outbound Intelligence Records from the GUI](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/security-management/threat-intelligence-security-center/tisc-create-intel-records-lib.html).
-   **Automated sharing using flows**: Configure flows to automatically share intelligence data to a target instance based on a defined condition. For more information, see [Automated Sharing of Outbound Intelligence Records](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/security-management/threat-intelligence-security-center/tisc-automated-outbound-intel-share.html).
-   **Sharing through a TAXII server**: Exchange threat intelligence data through TAXII collections using standardized threat intelligence sharing protocols. For more information, see [Exploring TAXII Outbound Server](tisc-taxii-outbound-server.md).

**Data transfer mechanism**

-   For Manual sharing via GUI and automated flow based sharing, the source TISC instance pushes the data directly to the target instance.
-   For TAXII based sharing, the target TISC instance pulls data from TAXII collections configured on the source instance.
