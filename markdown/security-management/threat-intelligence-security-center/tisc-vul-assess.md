6.  Fill in the required details such as **Title** and **Primary CVE**.

    A confirmation message appears indicating that Vulnerability assessment \{\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\} created successfully.

    **Note:**

    -   When you click the link from the confirmation message, the Vulnerability assessment record opens in read-only mode. The record includes a reference to the originating vulnerability, and relevant fields are automatically populated to maintain consistency.
    -   A corresponding work note is also added to the vulnerability record. To view it, navigate to the **Details** section and view the **Activity** stream.

## Result

**Verify your assessments**

1.  Navigate to the **Internal Intelligence** section on the Vulnerability record.
2.  View all associated vulnerability assessments under the **Vulnerability Response** section.
