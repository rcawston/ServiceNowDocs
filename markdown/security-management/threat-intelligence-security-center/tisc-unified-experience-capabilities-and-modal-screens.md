</table>-   **[Observable Enrichment](tisc-observable-enrichment.md)**  
The Enrich Observable WhoIs workflow performs enrichment on selected observables. If the observables are of a type recognized by the WhoisXML API Integration, the observables are enriched.
-   **[Run Threat Lookup](tisc-run-threat-lookup.md)**  
Select one or more implementations as applicable to run threat lookup on observables.
-   **[Run Sighting Search](tisc-run-sighting-search.md)**  
Perform Run Sighting Search related integration.
-   **[Run Observable Enrichment](tisc-run-observable-enrichment.md)**  
Select one or more implementations as applicable to run threat lookup on observables.
