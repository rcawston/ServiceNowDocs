# Import data using raw text

    **Important:**

    -   Any defanging characters will be cleaned as part of parsing and extraction of observables.
    -   For this pasted text option only URL, domain, file name, hashes, and IP address will be extracted and no other observable types will be extracted for the data import and in case of such type of observables such as registry, directory types, those will be skipped from importing.
3.  Click **Import from raw text** card.

    **Important:** While importing the threat intelligence data in the raw text format the characters are limited to 10,000. The raw text option can be used as a workaround to extract the observables from the PDF.
