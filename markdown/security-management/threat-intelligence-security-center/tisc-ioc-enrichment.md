# Automated IOC Enrichment

Learn how to automate enrichment of IOC’s using flows when they match a certain criterion.

## Before you begin

Role required:

-   System Administrator \(view, create or edit\)
-   sn\_sec\_tisc.admin \(view\)

## About this task

Automate enrichment of IOC’s triggers only when:

-   the type of the observable is a domain name, IPv4 address, or IPv6 address.
-   the observable is in a processed state.
-   the observable does not have the tags enriched or Skip Enrichment.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Threat Intelligence Security Center** &gt; **Administration**.

2.  Select **Automated Flows**.

3.  Select **Automated IOC Enrichment** action link to view the respective rule details in the flow designer.

4.  View the flow designer action for the following trigger:

    ```
    Observable Updated where (Type is Domain Name, or Type is IP address (V4), or Type is IP address (V6); and Processing Status is Processed; and TISC Tags does not contain Enriched, or TISC Tags does not contain Skip Enrichment, or TISC Tags does not contain Potential New Threat)
    ```

5.  **If the observable is an IPv4 or IPv6 address and it falls within an allowed CIDR range, then:**

    1.  Add the observable to Allow List.

    2.  Update the observables tags to Skip Enrichment.

    3.  End the flow for this observable.

6.  **Else, enrich the observable data with available capabilities:**

    1.  Perform threat lookup and sighting search to gather additional information about the observable.

    2.  Update the observable with enriched data.

    3.  Add a tag **Enriched** to indicate that the IOC has been processed.

7.  **Also, if the observables reputation is clean, then:**

    1.  Mark observable as false positive and inactivate.

8.  **Else, if observable reputation is unknown**

    1.  Add tag **Not Potential Threat &amp; Enriched** to indicate that it is not a threat.
