Fetch Data From

</td><td>

Start date from when the data needs to be fetched. Set this field with the time from when data needs to be ingested from the corresponding source. After setting this field, the next ingestion run fetches data from the configured time and consecutive runs fetch incremental data.For example, a source is scheduled to ingest data every hour. If you set **Fetch Data From** to Jan 12 6:00AM on Jan 12 9:30AM, the ingestion triggering on Jan 12 10:00AM fetches data from Jan 12 6:00AM to Jan 12 10:00AM. The next ingestion at 11:00AM fetches only incremental data from Jan 12 10:00AM to Jan 12 11:00AM.

**Note:** This means the scheduled runs will fetch data incrementally starting from the specified date onwards.
