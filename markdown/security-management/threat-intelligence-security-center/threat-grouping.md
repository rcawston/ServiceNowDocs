# Threat Grouping

A Threat Groupings object explicitly asserts that the referenced STIX Objects have a shared context. Threat groupings applies for STIX 2.x.

A Threat Groupings object represents a set of data that, given sufficient analysis, matures to convey an incident or threat report as a STIX Report object. For example, a Grouping could be used to characterize an ongoing investigation into a security event or incident.

A Threat Groupings object could also be used to assert that the referenced STIX Objects are related to an ongoing analysis process. For example, a threat analyst may collaborate with others in their trust community to examine a series of Campaigns and Indicators.

The Threat Grouping SDO contains a list of references to SDOs, SCOs, and SROs, along with an explicit statement of the context shared by the content, a textual description, and the name of the grouping.
