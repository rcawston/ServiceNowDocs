# View RSS Feeds

A threat intelligence feed is a real-time, continuous data stream that gathers information related to cyber risks or threats. RSS Feeds provides an easy way to stay up to date with your favorite security blogs or latest cyber security news.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_sec\_tisc.analyst

**Note:** Using this section, you can browse through ingested feeds. However, creating new records isn't supported.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Threat Intelligence Security Center**.

2.  Select the **Threat Intel Library** icon on the workspace.

3.  Go to **RSS Feeds** &gt; **All RSS Feeds** object.

4.  On the form, the following fields are automatically populated.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Title|Title of the RSS Feed.|
    |Description|Description that provides more details and context about the RSS feeds, potentially including its purpose and key characteristics.|
    |Link|Web link added to the RSS feeds.|
    |Source|RSS feed source from which this object record is created.|
    |Published Date|Date when the RSS feed is published.|
    |Author|Author for the RSS feed.|

5.  Select **Save** to apply the changes.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Notes|Additional notes for this feed.|

Media URL

Indicates the media URL.

Feedback Comments URL

</td><td>

Indicates the link to the feedback comments.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Status

</td><td>

Indicates the state of an RSS feed record in relation to its configured expiration period. This field is introduced to support tracking of ingested records.-   When a record is created through RSS feed ingestion, the application assigns an initial status based on its active validity period.
-   The status changes automatically as the record approaches or reaches its configured expiration time.
**Note:** This field identifies whether records are still valid for analysis or have aged out based on the data retention settings.

The **Status** field works in conjunction with the **Expiration time** field and reflects the retention behavior defined by the feed's **Expiry days** configuration.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Expiration time

</td><td>

The **Expiration time** value is automatically calculated based on the configured **Expiry days** period for the feed. When records are ingested, the application sets the expiration time by adding the configured number of days to the record creation date.If the expiry period isn't specified for an integration, the **Expiry period** field remains empty for the RSS feed record. As a result, the RSS feed record continues to remain active and doesn't expire.

**Note:**

For all feed integrations, the field configuration includes an Expiry days setting that defines the retention period for ingested data. Previously, records created through RSS feeds didn't include expiration tracking.

For example, if the expiry period is set to 30 days, each ingested record receives an expiration time equal to the ingestion date plus 30 days.

    -   Select **Add TISC Tags** to associate tags with the RSS feed record.
    -   Search and select the desired TISC tag.
    -   Select **Submit** to add the tag.

        A confirmation displays indicating that the tags are applied successfully.

    **RSS Feed Actions from the list view: Add Taxonomy**

    -   Select any RSS feed from the list view.
    -   Select **Add Taxonomy** to associate taxonomies with the RSS feed record.
    -   Select **Submit** to add the taxonomies.

        A confirmation displays indicating that the tags &amp; taxonomy values are applied successfully.

    **RSS Feed Actions from the list view: Add to Case**

    -   Select any RSS feed from the list view.
    -   Select **Add to Case** to associate the RSS feed record with a case.
    -   Select the case\(s\).
    -   Select **Add** to add the case to the RSS feed record.

        A confirmation displays indicating that the selected records are added to case\(s\) successfully.

6.  Modify the feed details, if required.

7.  Navigate to the **TISC Tags &amp; Taxonomies** section.

    1.  In the **TISC Tags** related list, **Select TISC Tags** to add tags.

    2.  In the **Taxonomy** related list, **Select Taxonomy** to add taxonomies directly from the RSS feed form view.

8.  Select **Save**.
