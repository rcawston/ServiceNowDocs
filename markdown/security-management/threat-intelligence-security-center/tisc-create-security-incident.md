# Create Security Incident from a Vulnerability Record

Create a security incident to track and manage remediation efforts for identified vulnerabilities. This process helps prioritize security responses and maintain audit trails.

## Before you begin

Role required:

-   sn\_sec\_tisc.analyst
-   sn\_si.analyst

## About this task

Before you begin, ensure that Security Incident Response \(SIR\) application is installed.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Threat Intelligence Security Center**.

2.  Select the **Threat Intel Library** icon on the workspace.

3.  Go to **Vulnerability Artifacts** &gt; **All Vulnerabilities**.

4.  Open a vulnerability record.

5.  Select **Create Security Incident**.

6.  On the form, **Short description** is automatically populated \(required\) and optionally update category, priority, assignment group, and description as necessary.

7.  Select **Submit**.

    A confirmation message appears indicating that Security incident \{\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\} created successfully, and a link to the Security Incident record is provided.

    **Note:**

    -   When you click the link from the confirmation message, the Security Incident opens in read-only mode. The record includes a reference to the originating vulnerability, and relevant fields are automatically populated to maintain consistency.
    -   A corresponding work note is also added to the vulnerability record. To access it, go to the **Details** section of the vulnerability record.
    -   Additionally, the system records a work note on the activity stream of the Security Incident Response Workspace indicating that the incident record is originated from a TISC vulnerability and providing a link to the related vulnerability record.
    The **TISC Context** feature in the Security Incident Response Workspace provides analysts direct access to threat intelligence linked to vulnerabilities associated with incidents. For more information, see [Working with TISC Context](../security-incident-response/working-with-tisc-context.md).

    This capability allows analysts to view and investigate related threat objects without leaving the Security Incident Response Workspace, streamlining analysis and enhancing incident response efficiency.
