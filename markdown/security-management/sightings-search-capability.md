# Security Operations Integration- Sightings Search capability

The **Sightings Search** capability accepts a set of observables, finds any integrations that support a Sightings Search, then executes these searches.

The Sightings Search capability has a workflow, [Security Operations Integration - Sightings Search Flow](secops-integration-sightings-search-workflow.md), that executes the sightings search. This workflow accepts a list of observables, finds any implementing capabilities, creates the queries based on Sightings Search Configurations, and executes the searches based on the configured workflow. Once the search is complete, a note is added to the incident Work notes including whether any sightings were found and if so, how many.

To view Sightings Search Configurations, navigate to **Security Operations** &gt; **Integrations** &gt; **Sightings Search Configurations**.

**Note:** If no implementations are available, capability actions are not displayed in product menus.

-   **[Create sightings search configuration records](sightings-search-configurations.md)**  
Create multiple sightings search configuration records and use them while querying multiple log stores or varying the search parameters.
