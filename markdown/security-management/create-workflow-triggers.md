# Create Security Operations workflow triggers

Create a workflow trigger that contains a condition on a table.

## Before you begin

Security Operations contains several workflow triggers in the base system:

-   **Configuration item changes on an active Security Incident**

    Uses integration to enrich CI-related data as configuration items change.

-   **Rescan vulnerable group**

    Rescans a vulnerable group, using the [Scan vulnerability workflow](vulnerability-response/scan-vulnerability-workflow.md), when you **Close/Ignore** the group.

-   **Rescan vulnerable item**

    Rescans a vulnerable item, using the [Scan vulnerability item workflow](vulnerability-response/scan-vulnerable-item-workflow.md) when you **Close/Ignore** the item.


Roles required:

-   To read: sn\_sec\_cmn.read
-   To create or update: sn\_sec\_cmn.write
-   To delete: sn\_sec\_cmn.admin
