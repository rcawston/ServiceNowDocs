# Add a compensating control to the library

As a Vulnerability Manager or Analyst, add a list of compensatory controls to the Compensating Controls library in the Security Exposure Management Workspace, which can be applied for the risk reduction of host vulnerable items and remediation tasks.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_vul.vulnerability\_analyst, or sn\_vul.vulnerability\_admin

## About this task

Some commonly used compensating controls are shipped with the base system. You can view these compensating controls by navigating to **Workspaces** &gt; **Security Exposure Management Workspace** &gt; **Lists** &gt; **Libraries** &gt; **Compensating controls**. You can activate or deactivate these compensating controls as per your requirement.

**Note:** The compensating controls feature is available for host vulnerabilities only.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Security Exposure Management Workspace**.

2.  On the List page under Libraries, select **Compensating Controls**.

3.  Click **New**.

4.  On the Create Compensating Controls form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Name|Name of the compensating control, which appears as an option in the **Compensating controls** drop-down of the Request exception modal.|
    |Description|Brief information that provides details about the Compensating Control.|
    |Active|Status of the compensating control. Only active controls appear in the **Compensating controls** drop-down of the Request exception modal.|

5.  Select **Save**.

6.  On the Compensating Controls list under Libraries, select the desired compensating control and select **Edit**, activate or deactivate a compensating control and click **Save** to modify the compensating controls.

    All the active compensating controls appear as an option in the **Compensating controls** drop-down of the Request exception modal for risk reduction requests.


## What to do next

Starting from v21.0 of Vulnerability Response, you can associate compensating controls with CVEs or TPEs after adding a compensating controls to the library. For more information on how to associate compensating controls, see [Associate compensating controls with CVEs or TPEs for risk reduction requests](vulnerability-manager-workspace/associate-controls-cve-risk-reduction.md).

-   **[Associate compensating controls with CVEs or TPEs for risk reduction requests](sem-associate-controls-cve-risk-reduction.md)**  
As a Vulnerability Manager or Analyst, you can associate relevant compensating controls with a Common Vulnerability Entry \(CVE\) or Third-party Entry \(TPE\) in the Security Exposure Management Workspace, which can be used for reducing the risk posed by a vulnerability.
-   **[Disable or enable risk reduction for a CVE or TPE](sem-disable-risk-reduction.md)**  
As a Vulnerability Manager and Analyst, you can disable or enable the risk reduction requests for the host vulnerabilities associated with a Common Vulnerability Entry \(CVE\) or Third-party Entry \(TPE\) in the Security Exposure Management Workspace.
