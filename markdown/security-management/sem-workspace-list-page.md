# Security Exposure Management Workspace List view

The List view in the Security Exposure Management Workspace permits vulnerability and security managers and analysts to view remediation progress on records, drill down into records, and view the status of their approval requests and exceptions.

Role required:

-   sn\_vul.vulnerability\_analyst, sn\_vul.vulnerability\_admin, or sn\_vul.remediation\_owner for host vulnerable items \(VITs\)
-   sn\_vul.app\_sec\_manager, sn\_vul.app\_security\_champion for application vulnerable items \(AVITs\)
-   sn\_vul\_container.vulnerability\_analyst, sn\_vul\_container.vulnerability\_admin, or sn\_vul\_container.remediation\_owner for container vulnerable items \(CVITs\)
-   sn\_vulc.admin, sn\_vulc.remediation\_owner for configuration test results \(CTRs\)

These lists and links provide you with easy access to records and tasks. It contains two tabs:

-   **Lists** tab: Displays the default lists for remediation efforts, remediation tasks, vulnerable items, configuration test results, solutions, exceptions, and libraries.
-   **My Lists** tab: Displays any lists that you’ve renamed from the Lists tab and any lists that you create.

    You can also create your own list to monitor remediation progress. For more information, see [Create a customized list of records](sem-create-custom-list.md).


## Lists tab

The following table shows the lists available in the Lists tab of the List page:

**Tip:**

If the **sn\_vul\_cmn\_ws.navigate\_to\_workspace** system property is set to `true` by an admin, upon selecting the predefined filter links in the Vulnerability Response, Application Vulnerability Response, Container Vulnerability Response and Configuration Compliance modules from the **All** menu, these links open in the List page of the Security Exposure Management Workspace based on your role.

For example, if you select **Assigned to My Groups** by navigating to **All** &gt; **Security Exposure Management** &gt; **Remediation Tasks** &gt; **Assigned to My Groups**, this link is redirected to the Security Exposure Management Workspace. The **Assigned to My Groups** list in the **Remediation Tasks** module opens in the List page of the Security Exposure Management Workspace if you have the vulnerability admin or analyst role. To view the host remediation tasks group the tasks by Record Type.

You can hide the record count on the lists using the **glide.ui.list.seismic.omit.count** system property. For more information on how to turn off/on the record count on a list, see the [KBB0010402](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KBB0010402) KB article.
