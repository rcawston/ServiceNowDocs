# Examples for remediation task creation in the Security Exposure Management Workspace

When you create remediation tasks manually in the Security Exposure Management Workspace, records are grouped into a remediation task based on the grouping criteria you select.

Consider the following example where 10 records are selected for remediation task creation. After providing the record selection details and a brief description, select the **Grouping criteria** according to your requirement and then select how you want to manage the records that are already part of existing remediation tasks.

## Remediation task creation based on the grouping criteria

|Vulnerable item id|Existing remediation tasks|Assignment group|Configuration item|Vulnerability|Risk rating|
|------------------|--------------------------|----------------|------------------|-------------|-----------|
|VIT10001|VUL10021, VUL10022|Remediation Manager|APSVR-NY-1672|CVE-2018-9020|4|
|VIT10002|-|Vulnerability Response|DEV-IBM-NY-682|CVE-2018-9020|2|
|VIT10003|VUL10021|LDAP Admins|DEV-IBM-NY-682|CVE-2012-5357|1|
|VIT10004|-|Remediation Manager|CRMBK-SD-4210|CVE-2013-1710|4|
|VIT10005|VUL10022|Vulnerability Response|DEV-IBM-NY-682|CVE-2018-9020|2|
|VIT10006|-|Remediation Manager|CRMBK-SD-4210|CVE-2013-1710|2|
|VIT10007|-|LDAP Admins|DEV-SAP-SD-9388|CVE-2013-3906|1|
|VIT10008|-|LDAP Admins|DEV-IBM-NY-682|CVE-2013-3906|1|
|VIT10009|-|Remediation Manager|CRMBK-SD-4210|CVE-2013-1710|2|
|VIT10010|-|LDAP Admins|DEV-SAP-SD-9388|CVE-2013-3906|4|

The following list shows how the records are grouped into remediation tasks based on the grouping criteria selected when creating the remediation task.

-   **Scenario1: Grouping criteria is selected as “Assignment group” and Managing records in other remediation tasks is selected as “Skip records for the new remediation tasks”**

    The records with the same assignment group are grouped into one remediation task. The records that are already part of existing remediation tasks are not added to the new remediation tasks. Here, three remediation tasks are created, each containing the records that are assigned to the **Remediation Manager**, **LDAP Admins**, and **Vulnerability Response** assignment groups.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>-   **Scenario 2: Grouping criteria is selected as “Assignment group and configuration item” and Managing records in other remediation tasks is selected as “Transfer records to the new remediation tasks”**

    The records with the same configuration item that are assigned to the same assignment group are grouped into a remediation task. The VIT10001, VIT10003, and VIT10005 records are removed from their old remediation tasks and moved to the new remediation tasks. Here, five remediation tasks are created.

</table>-   **Scenario 3: Grouping criteria is selected as “Assignment group and vulnerability” and Managing records in other remediation tasks is selected as “Keep records in both the current and new remediation tasks”**

    The records with the same vulnerability that are assigned to the same assignment group are grouped into a remediation task. The VIT10001, VIT10003, and VIT10005 records will be added to their respective new remediation tasks without being removed from their old remediation tasks.Here, five remediation tasks are created.

    The records with the same risk rating that are assigned to the same assignment group are grouped into a remediation task. The VIT10001, VIT10003, and VIT10005 records will be added to their respective new remediation tasks without being removed from their old remediation tasks. Here, five remediation tasks are created.
