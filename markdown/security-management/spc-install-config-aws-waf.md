# Configure the AWS WAF integration for mitigation controls monitoring

Determine if your virtual machines are protected with the AWS WAF integration for mitigation controls monitoring.

## Before you begin

Data is imported by two separate applications:

-   The Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application imports the names and the default actions, allow or block, of the Web ACLs that you define in your AWS Service Account. The Discovery Pattern `Amazon AWS - Web ACL (LP)` is activated with the application.
-   The Mitigations Controls Monitoring application imports the actual Web ACL rules and the relationships between associated resources like an application load balancer. This extension is included as a part of the Mitigations Controls Monitoring application.

Verify you have completed the steps to define Web ACLs and rules and activated the required applications for the AWS WAF Integration described in [Exploit Protection \(WAF\) mitigation controls](spc-controls-policies-for-exploit-waf.md) prior to activating the applications.

Roles required:

-   admin for installation of plugins in your ServiceNow AI Platform® instance.
-   SPC Admin Group for configuration of integrations in the workspace.
-   AWS credentials for the AWS service account you want to use.

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Security Posture Control Workspace** &gt; **Connectors and use cases setup** &gt; **SPC API Integrations tab**.

2.  Select the **AWS WAF** tile.
