# Download and activate applications

Download the required Security Exposure Management Workspace applications from the ServiceNow® Store into your ServiceNow AI Platform® and activate them to upgrade.

## Before you begin

-   Download core products and applications.
    -   A product contains one or more applications. For example, Vulnerability Response is a product.
    -   An application is a standalone piece of code that implements a collection of features.
    -   A plugin is a set of customizations that extends the functionality of the ServiceNow AI Platform® and any apps already installed on your instance. Some plugins are pre-activated in your instance, while others might need to be activated manually by you or by ServiceNow® personnel.
-   Some applications have dependencies that you must download and install separately.

For more information about downloading and activating applications see [Download an application from the ServiceNow Store for the first time](download-app-first-time.md).

**Note:** If you're downloading applications to sub-production or development instances, it's not necessary to get entitlements.

Role required: admin for download, installation, and activation of all applications.

## Procedure

1.  Click the link provided to you in the email you received to access the required applications in the ServiceNow Store.

    Select the **Dependencies** link to view the dependencies for an application on the application's listing page in the ServiceNow Store.

2.  After you have downloaded the applications into your ServiceNow AI Platform, navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

3.  To activate the applications you downloaded along with any of their dependencies and plugins in the order listed in the following table, locate the cards for the applications and select **Install**.

    Any dependency applications are typically installed automatically along with an application and are displayed in the Application installation dialog. However, if you are prompted to install dependency plugins during the installation, follow the prompts provided.
