# Creating your own API connectors in Security Posture Control

Create your own Security Posture Control \(SPC\) API connectors using the connector framework that is included with the application.

## Overview for the connector builder framework

## Benefits

Create your own SPC API connectors quickly to help you integrate with security tools and import asset data that is based on the unique requirements of your environment. Use imported data to help you monitor your overall security posture and identify assets that are missing key security tools.

The connector framework includes the following features.

-   A step-by-step process to guide you through the connector builder.
-   A single place to build and maintain all your SPC integrations to import custom data into your CMDB.
-   After you publish them, monitor your API connectors on the SPC API Integrations tab in the **Security Posture Control** workspace.

## The API connector builder

You use the Connector builder in the Security Posture Control workspace to create and publish your customized API connectors.

## Prerequisites

Before you start creating your API connector, you might prefer to set up any credentials for the service \(vendor\) that you want to implement with and have their API documentation and credentials handy as you work through the Connector builder. See [Enter metadata](spc-sgc-template-stepper1.md) for more information.
