# Exploring supported applications for Software Bill of Materials

Third-party vulnerability intelligence and other integrations with the Software Bill of Materials applications can enhance the data of your uploaded files.

## Supported applications benefits

Third-party vulnerability intelligence and other integrations with the Software Bill of Materials applications permit you to view counts for components that are considered stale and abandoned, as well as information about if you can fix any vulnerabilities associated with components.

The ServiceNow® applications and third-party integrations listed in the following table are supported by the SBOM applications. These applications provide you with enriched vulnerability data, vulnerability intelligence, and other key information that can help you view and prioritize the vulnerabilities associated with SBOM files. All these applications and integrations are available from the ServiceNow® Store.
