# ServiceNow Security Operations integration development guidelines

The ServiceNow platform provides several mechanisms for developing integrations with external systems. The ServiceNow Security Operations product suite adds integration capabilities intended to streamline the process of integrating with security-focused external systems.

-   Script includes
-   Inbound/outbound web services
-   Data sources
-   Import sets
-   Transform maps
