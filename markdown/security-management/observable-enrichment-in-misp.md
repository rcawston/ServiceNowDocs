# Observable enrichment in MISP

By enriching observables with additional information from various MISP sources during incident response investigations, you can contain identified threats.

**Parent Topic:**[Using MISP to investigate and analyze threats](using-misp-to-detect-and-analyze-threats.md)

## Enable automatic observable enrichment in MISP

Enable automatic observable enrichment in the ServiceNow AI Platform MISP when new observables are associated with the security incident.

### Before you begin

-   Enable the Security Incident Response system property for the **Enables or Disables the scheduled job, Lookup Security Incident Observables** option to trigger the observable enrichment capability in SIR.
-   Role required: sn\_si.analyst

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Security Incident** &gt; **Show All Incidents**.

2.  Select the security incident that contains the observables that you want to enrich the observable data in MISP for.

3.  Review the work notes after new observables have been associated with the security incident.

    The following example shows that a work note posts when the [Security Operations Integration - Enrich Observable flow](secops-integration-enrich-observ-wf.md) triggers.

4.  In the MISP Enrichment Results related list of the security incident, view the enrichment results after the flow execution completes.

    ![View the work notes of the Observable Enrichment status after the execution is completed.](../image/flows-misp-worknotes-end.png)

    **Note:** You must configure that the MISP Enrichment Results related list appears in the security incident related lists. For more information, see [related list configuration](security-incident-response/sir-new-ui-setup-form-uiaction.md).

    The following example shows the enrichment results in the MISP.

## Perform a manual observable enrichment in MISP

Select individual or multiple observables and perform a manual observable enrichment so that you can enrich observables with additional information from various MISP sources.

### Before you begin

-   [Review the MISP user role and permissions](misp-user-roles-and-permissions.md) for using the MISP bi-directional features.
-   Role required: sn\_si.analyst

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Security Incident** &gt; **Show All Incidents**.

2.  Select the security incident that contains the observables that you want to perform the enrichment for.

3.  Click **Show All Related Lists** and the **Associated Observables** tab.

4.  Select the observable and from the Actions menu, click **Run Observable Enrichment**.

    You can select multiple observables for a sighting search.

    The Run Observable Enrichment dialog box appears.

5.  Select a MISP source and in the Selected column, select an implementation to enrich the selected observables.

6.  Click **Submit**.

    A work note shows that the [Security Operations Integration - Enrich Observable workflow](secops-integration-enrich-observ-wf.md) has triggered. The associated implementation workflows execute to perform the enrichment. You can view the work notes in the security incident to view the status.

    The following example shows how to view the work notes for a manual observable enrichment.

    ![View work notes for manual observable enrichment.](../image/misp-enrichment-manual-worknotes.png "Work notes for manual observable enrichment")

    The enrichment message lists the created event. You can view the event in the ServiceNow AI Platform or in the MISP instance and view the details of the record in the MISP Enrichment Results tab.


## Add or remove tags to MISP attributes

Add or remove tags in MISP to classify events or attributes. You can use tagging globally to enable your classification or use tags locally when you don't want MISP events to be modified during your classification.

### Before you begin

-   [Review the MISP user role and permissions](misp-user-roles-and-permissions.md) for using the MISP bi-directional features.
-   Verify that the attribute that you are editing belongs to the same organization as the MISP user.
-   Note that the tags and galaxies that are available to you are based on the MISP source and its distribution permissions.
-   Role required: sn\_sec\_misp.write

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Security Incident** &gt; **Show All Incidents**.

2.  Select the security incident that contains the observables, attributes, or events that you want to add the tags for.

3.  Click **Show All Related Lists** and the MISP Enrichment Results related list.

4.  Click the preview icon ![Preview icon.](../image/misp-attribute-preview-open.png) next to a record, and then click **Open Record**.

    The following example shows how to review the **MISP Enrichment Results** and how to open a MISP enrichment record.

Distribution

</td><td>

Distribution option controls, such as who can view this event after it is published. This option also controls whether the event is synchronized to other servers. The distribution is inherited by the attributes, and the most restrictive setting wins. The distribution options are as follows: -   Your organization only: Enables only members of your organization to view this event. The event can be pulled to another instance by one of your organization members where only your organization has the access to view it. Events with this setting are not synchronized.
-   This community only: Enables users that are part of your MISP community to view the event, including your own organization, organizations on this MISP server, and organizations that run MISP servers that synchronize with this server. Any other organizations that are connected to these linked servers are restricted from viewing the event.
-   Connected communities: Enables users that are part of your MISP community to view the event, including all organizations on this MISP server, all organizations on MISP servers that synchronize with this server, and the hosting organizations of servers that connect to any server that is two hops away. Any other organizations that are connected to the linked servers that are two hops away are restricted from viewing the event.
-   All communities: Shares the event with all MISP communities, which allows the event to be freely available.
