# Visualization library

The Visualization library lists all the widgets that you can use to visualize and categorize findings. It includes a set of default widgets and any custom widgets that you create for organization-specific reporting. You can browse the available widgets, understand the data they use, and add them to dashboards to build tailored security exposure views.

You can use the Visualization library to:

-   **Explore available widgets**

    Review the complete set of default and custom widgets available for building dashboards.

-   **Understand widget behavior**

    Review key details such as data sources, grouping, visualization type, and activation status to choose the appropriate widget for your analysis.

-   **Create a custom widget**

    Build and configure your own widgets to visualize specific metrics or data insights that matter most to your organization.


The following table lists the available widgets, associated tables, and what they display.

</table>If your instance uses localization, make sure that the widget titles show up correctly in all supported languages. Default widgets already include translated titles.But if you update a default widget, create a custom widget, or rename a widget, remember to add or update the translation entry. This keeps titles consistent across languages. For steps, see [Localize widget titles](sem-localize-widget-titles.md).
