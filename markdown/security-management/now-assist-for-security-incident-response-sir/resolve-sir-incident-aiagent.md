# Resolve a security incident

Chat with an AI agent in the Now Assist panel to resolve an incident.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_si.analyst

## About this task

**Important:** This agentic workflow is turned on by default. For more information, see [Now Assist skills, agents, and agentic workflows on by default](../../intelligent-experiences/now-assist-skills/now-assist-skills-on-by-default.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Security Incident** &gt; **Security Incident Response Workspace**.

2.  Open the security incident that you want to resolve using the AI agent.

3.  Select the Now Assist \(![Now Assist panel for AI agent icon.](../image/ai-icon-now-assist.png)\) icon.

    The Resolve security incident agentic workflow is on-demand. You can enter a query in natural language to resolve a security incident by using this agentic workflow.

4.  On the Now Assist panel, ask the agent to resolve the security incident by entering `Resolve this incident`, `Resolve this security incident`, or `Resolve the security incident: SIR0012345`.

    The Now Assist panel provides all the actions that you can perform on the security incident.

5.  Select **Resolve security incident**.

    ![Sample resolution plan for a security incident.](../image/ai-agent-resolution-plan.png)

    The AI agent analyzes the security incident and provides a summary of the incident and its current state. Additionally, by using the incident details, knowledge articles, and similar closed security incidents, the AI agent provides a resolution plan.

6.  Enter positive responses such as `looks good` or `Ok` if you agree to the resolution plan.

    For a positive response, the AI agent investigates each step in the resolution plan and assists the analyst \(the user with the sn\_si.analyst role\) to resolve it. For each step, the AI agent provides feedback and requests for intervention from the analyst. For example, if the AI agent identifies the incident generated for a phishing email, the following agentic workflow occurs:
