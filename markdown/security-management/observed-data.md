    |-----|-----------|
    |**First Observed**|The initial time when the data was seen.|
    |**Last Observed**|The last time when the data was seen.|
    |**Observed Count**|The number of times that each Cyber-observable object was seen. The value must be an integer from 1 through 999,999,999.|
    |**Source**|Specifies the threat source from which this record is created.|
    |**Source ID**|Unique identifier for this object in the threat source.|
