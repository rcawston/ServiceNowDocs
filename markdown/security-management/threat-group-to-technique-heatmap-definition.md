# Threat group to technique heatmap definition

Define the threat group to technique heatmap definition so that on the heatmap you can measure and detect the attack patterns that threat groups are using to attack your organization. The probability of an attack using a particular technique increases when you have a high number of attackers.

## Before you begin

Role required:

-   sn\_ti.admin, sn\_si.admin: write access
-   sn\_ti.read: read access

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Threat Intelligence** &gt; **MITRE ATT&amp;CK Administration** &gt; **Threat Group-Technique Heat Map Definition**.

2.  Review the threat group to technique heatmap definition and customize the entries for your environment.

<table id="table_tm2_qx2_vrb"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Number of Threat Groups \(min range\)

</td><td>

The minimum number of threat groups using a particular technique.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Number of Threat Groups \(max range\)

</td><td>

The maximum number of threat groups using a particular technique. The probability of an attack using a particular technique increases when you have a high number of attackers.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Heat Map Color

</td><td>

Color that is assigned to the threat group category. The color that you define is used to highlight the threat group category in the heat map.You can customize the colors using HEX codes and RGB\(A\) values.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Text Color

</td><td>

Color that is assigned to the threat group text. The color that you define is used to highlight the threat groups in the heat map.You can customize the colors using HEX codes and RGB\(A\) values.
