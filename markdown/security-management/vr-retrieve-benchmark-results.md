# Opt-in for benchmark scores

Get benchmark scores by registering your instance to the ServiceNow central instance. The latter maintains information of multiple industries to provide the benchmark score.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

For more information on Benchmarking, see [Benchmarks overview](../it-service-management/benchmarks/c_BenchOverview.md).

    1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Properties** &gt; **All Properties**.

    2.  Select **sn\_bm\_client.central\_instance\_url** system property.

    3.  In the **Value** field, enter the benchmark central instance URL.

        **Note:** If the instance is provisioned, your details are pushed to the central instance automatically.

    4.  Select **Opt-in** from the widget to validate and establish a connection with the central instance.

2.  To upload your score to the central instance, follow these steps:
