# Summarize a case by using Now Assist for Customer Service Management \(CSM\)

Generate a summary from the fields that you selected on the case record and quickly understand the case context by using the case summarization skill in the Now Assist for Customer Service Management \(CSM\) application.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_customerservice\_agent, sn\_customerservice.consumer\_agent

## About this task

The case summarization skill provides you with a concise summary of a customer service case, including the issue, actions taken, and resolution details. With this skill, you can do the following tasks:

-   Generate an initial summary of a case so that you can understand the case context.
-   Summarize all the work that has been done on a case.

The case summarization skill is available in CSM Configurable Workspace and in Core UI.

-   In CSM Configurable Workspace, you use the Case summary by Now Assist component to generate a summary. This component appears before the activity stream.

    **Note:** You can also generate a case summary on demand from the Now Assist panel.

-   In Core UI, you select the **Summarize** button on the case record to generate a summary.

The case summarization skill checks the case record to determine if there’s enough information available to create a summary:

-   When an agent opens the case record
-   When an agent refreshes the case record page

If there’s enough data the Case summary component displays the **Summarize** button. If there isn’t enough data, the component displays a message in place of the button.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **CSM Configurable Workspace** and open a customer service case.

2.  In the Case summary by Now Assist component, select **Summarize**.

    The Case summary by Now Assist component appears above the activity stream. When automatic triggering is enabled for case summarization, the system proactively generates a summary when a case is opened. When automatic triggering is turned off, **Summarize** button is displayed, enabling agents to generate the summary on demand. The component is collapsed by default and expands to display the summary. For longer summaries that don't fit in the window, select **View more** and use the scroll bar to view the rest of the content.

    **Note:**

    -   The case summary card is available in CSM Configurable Workspace version 26.1.0 and earlier.
    -   Generating and displaying the summary may take several seconds.

3.  After summarizing a case, you can add it to the case work notes, expand or collapse it, provide feedback, copy it, or view information about it.

**Provide feedback for the summary**

</td><td>

If you think that the summary was helpful, select the helpful icon \(![Helpful icon.](../image/icon-helpful.png)\). If you think that the summary wasn’t helpful, select the not helpful icon \(![Not helpful icon.](../image/icon-not-helpful.png)\).This feedback improves the generative AI model and can help to improve the future versions of this skill. The system gathers the feedback on each generated summary and stores it in the generative AI logs \(sys\_generative\_ai\_log\_list.do\).
