This AI agent does the following actions:

-   Gathers the context from the case, including the attempted steps.
-   Identifies the missing context by analyzing the similar cases, knowledge base articles, and Standard Operating Procedure \(SOP\) documents that are attached to knowledge base articles.
-   Proposes additional troubleshooting steps.

Agentic workflows can access this AI agent in Core UI or CSM/FSM workspace.
