## General Configuration Steps

Each skill has it’s own configuration process. However, skill activation follows the same guided setup. What configuring steps are required varies depending on the skill.

Common Configuration components:

-   **Trigger:** Allows you to configure the circumstances in which a skill is generated. For example, chat summarizations can be configured to generate when the chat handoff is done from a live agent to a live agent.
-   **Input:** Configure the data used to create the information generated by the skill. For example, resolution notes information is generated from the description, short description, work notes, and the additional comments fields of existing case notes.
-   **Availability:** customize how and when the skill capability is active and accessible. For example, email reply recommendations can be configured to be always available, or defined using the condition builder to determine whether or not a user can activate the skill.
-   **Access:**determine who can access this skill. By selecting specific roles, you're controlling who can use it. The roles you choose will also be available in the next step **Select display**.
-   **Display:** determine where the skill appears. For example, the call summarization skill can be configured to display on forms and workspaces or in the Now Assist panel.

Saving and activating the configuration setup process is the same across all Now Assist skills.

**Finalize and Activate Setup**

1.  After selecting **Review and Activate** to examine changes, select **Done** to close the skill configuration settings.
2.  Select **Skill** to turn on the skill for agents and complete the configuration.
