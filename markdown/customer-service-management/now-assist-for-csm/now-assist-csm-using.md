# Using Now Assist for Customer Service Management \(CSM\)

If you have an agent role, you can summarize the customer chat conversations, summarize the case details, and generate the case resolution notes with the Now Assist for Customer Service Management \(CSM\) application.

## Skills reuse

By default, all skills exist in the global domain. When you use Now Assist in a domain-separated environment, users are only able to access data within their domain. For example, if a user uses the summarization skill, Now Assist only uses material that exists within the user's domain when generating that summary. Additionally, there is no co-mingling of data for domain-separated instances when using generative AI skills. The data resides only on the instance, and the shared services used for generative AI do not persist any requests \(prompts\) and responses. For more information, see [Domain separation in the Now Assist Admin console](../../intelligent-experiences/domain-separation-in-the-now-assist-admin-console.md). \(Note that global domain is not the same as global scope. For more information, see [Exploring Next Experience pickers](../../platform-user-interface/next-experience-pickers.md).\)

Summarize your chat conversations to understand the chat context quicker:

-   Summarize the chat between the Virtual Agent and the customer when the chat is handed off to a live agent.
-   Summarize the chat between a live agent and a customer when a chat is handed off to another live agent or when an agent wraps up the conversation and ends the interaction.
-   Summarize the chat at any point during the conversation using the `/summarize` quick action.

Summarize the case details to understand the case context quicker. These summaries are useful for long-running or complex cases that include multiple conversations between agents and customers.

Generate the case resolution notes to wrap up cases faster. When you're ready to propose a solution to a customer, this feature can generate resolution notes and add them to the Case form. The resolution notes also provide the context about the case resolution to other agents who might encounter similar issues.
