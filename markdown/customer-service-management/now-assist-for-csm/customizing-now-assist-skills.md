# Customizing a Now Assist for CSM skill

Learn how to access, activate, and customize a Now Assist for CSM skill using the Now Assist Admin console and Now Assist Skill Kit.

Role required: admin

Now Assist for CSM provides base system skills that can be tailored to meet specific business requirements. Customization ensures that skills align with your organization's workflows, data sources, and user roles. There are two main ways to customize:

-   Using Now Assist Admin console: Modify base system skills, input configurations, and display settings.
-   Using Now Assist Skill Kit: Build and publish custom skills for advanced use cases by customizing inputs and prompts, and then publish it. You can also use the Now Assist Skill Kit to clone base system skills, as long as they are the latest versions created after the release of the Now Assist Skill Kit.
