# Change an insight to use a different field for trending topics

Change the field used in a trending topics insight to display data from a different field, such as changing from Assignment Group to Consumer or Product.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin or maint

## About this task

For trending topics insights, it is simple to change the field being analyzed. This procedure allows you to duplicate an existing insight and modify it to use a different field while preserving optimization and formatting.

The different UI Builder Component names for Trending topics dashboard are OOB Trending Topics Dashboard, Top Trends, Trending topics by Field Insight \(accounts, products, assignment group, channels\), OOB Topic Details Dashboard, Topic Over Time Visualization, Topic Breakdown Visualization, Topic Affected Regions Visualization.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **UI Builder**.

2.  Under **Components** tab search for the corresponding component.

    For example, open **OOB Trending Topics Dashboard**. Make a clone if needed.

3.  Select **Insight Carousel Item 1** and [duplicate](../../application-development/ui-builder/duplicate-components.md) it.

    Drag the newly duplicated component to reorder as needed.

4.  Select the component within the carousel item and on the right-hand panel, change the field to your desired field ID.

5.  Select **Save**.

    The insight now displays trending topics data based on the newly specified field.
