Lookup by name, phone, or email

The contact lookup component enables agents to do the following:-   Look up a contact by name, phone number, or email address. As the agent types characters in the search box, matching information appears in record cards below the search box.

You can also create a record to add a guest user as a contact. For more information, see [Create a customer contact](create-a-customer-contact_EaaI.md).
