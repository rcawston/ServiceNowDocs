# Playbook page templates

Use playbook page templates to create pages and page variants for use in CSM Configurable Workspace. These pages and page variants provide agents with either horizontal or vertical playbooks that they can use to complete tasks and resolve cases.

The following page templates are available with the Playbooks for Customer Service Management application \[com.sn\_csm\_playbook\]. For more information, see [Playbook plugins](setting-up-csm-playbooks.md#playbook-plugins).

|Page template|Description|
|-------------|-----------|
|[Case playbook: horizontal stages](csm-playbook-templates.md#case-playbook-horizontal-stages-page-template)|Includes a horizontal stage picker that displays across the top of the UI and shows persistent information in the left panel.|
|[Case playbook: vertical stages](csm-playbook-templates.md#case-playbook-vertical-stages-page-template)|Includes a vertical stage picker that displays in the left panel. This stage picker can track overall progress on the UI in a vertical view.|

Considerations for using these page templates include the number of stages that appear in the picker and the length of the stage names. For example, longer stage names in the horizontal playbook can be truncated.

**Note:** By default, the playbook page templates aren’t active. To activate a page template, see [Activate a playbook page or page variant](activate-process-based-page.md).

</table>## Using multiple form controllers

The multiple form controller feature enables page authors to add multiple form components to UI Builder templates. This feature is available with the following playbook page templates:

-   Case playbook: horizontal stages
-   Case playbook: vertical stages

With this feature, page authors can:

-   Integrate inline tabs with forms that use dedicated form controller instances, eliminating the need for page collections and enhancing UI Builder usability and runtime performance.
-   Enhance record pages with custom component bundles that include a form controller.
-   Incorporate modals containing forms into record pages, facilitating the transmission of notifications and form updates back to the main page.

For more information about using multiple form controllers, see [Add forms to UI Builder pages](../application-development/ui-builder/add-forms-to-ui-builder-pages.md).
