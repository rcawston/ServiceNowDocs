# Walk-up feature configuration

Understand the configuration of the Walk-up feature in Engagement Messenger module to configure the field values.

To enable walk-up feature for your customers, ensure that you activate the following plugins in your ServiceNow instance:

-   Walk-up for CSM plugin \(com.snc.walkup\_for\_csm\) for authenticated users
-   Guest Walk-up Experience for Customer Service plugin \(sn\_guest\_walkup\_cs\) for unauthenticated users

Once the plugin is active, navigate to the Features section of the guided configuration view of your Engagement Messenger module and enable the Field service feature.
