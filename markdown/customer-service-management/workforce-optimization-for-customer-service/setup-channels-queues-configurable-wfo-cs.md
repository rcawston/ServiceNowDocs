# Setting up service channels and queues

You can set up service channels, queues, and key performance indicators \(KPIs\) to route work items automatically to agents based on an agent's availability, capacity, and skills.

With Workforce Optimization for Customer Service, you, as a channel administrator, can set up service channels and work item queues so that managers can view the real-time operational metrics for the work that is being done by their teams and the specific items that their teams are working on. You can also configure real-time refresh intervals for the metrics and lists so that managers can always see the latest information about their teams.

Configure filters to refine the search and view targeted results. Filters are persisted across all channel management pages in the session. To view a list of the default interactive filters and the KPI reports for channels, queues, agents, and groups that you can map to the interactive filters, see [Interactive Filters](components-installed-configurable-wfo-cs.md) under the Channel Management section. By default, the assignment group filter is applied to all lists and groups that you manage. You can disable interactive filters by using the **sn\_channel\_mgmt.filter\_config.enable** property.

## Add service channels and queues

Add service channels and queues to automatically route incoming work items to agents.

### Before you begin

Role required: sn\_channel\_mgmt.admin

### About this task

A service channel is a means of assigning a specific type of work items to agents. You can modify the existing service channels or create your own custom service channel.

### Procedure

1.  To create a service channel, do the following:

    1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workforce Optimization for Customer Service** &gt; **Channel Management** &gt; **Service Channels**.
    2.  Click **New** and see [Create a service channel](../../conversational-interfaces/advanced-work-assignment/awa-create-service-channel.md) to create the service channel.
    3.  Click **Submit**.
    The service channel is created.

2.  To create a queue, do the following:

    1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workforce Optimization for Customer Service** &gt; **Channel Management** &gt; **Queues** or select the service channel and click the **Queues** tab.
    2.  Click **New** and see [Create a work item queue](../../conversational-interfaces/advanced-work-assignment/awa-create-queue.md) to create the queue.
    The queue is created in the service channel.


## Create assignment rules and groups

Define agent assignment rules and specify groups of agents who are eligible to receive overflow work assignments for a queue.

### Before you begin

You must first create a new assignment rule before you create a service channel. For more information, see [create a service channel](../../conversational-interfaces/advanced-work-assignment/awa-create-service-channel.md). Use [Advanced Work Assignment](../../conversational-interfaces/advanced-work-assignment/awa-overview.md) \(AWA\) to route work items automatically to agents based on an agent's availability, capacity, and skills.

Role required: sn\_channel\_mgmt.admin

### About this task

An eligible assignment group can consist of one or more groups of agents available to work on items in the queue.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workforce Optimization for Customer Service** &gt; **Channel Management** &gt; **Queues**.

2.  Click the queue to which you want to define an assignment rule.

3.  In the **Assignment Eligibility** tab, click **New**.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_nln_krq_lfb"><thead><tr><th>

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>5.  Click **Submit** to create the eligible or **Update** if modifying an eligible assignment pool.

    The Queues \[awa\_queues\] table is updated with the eligible assignment group.

    **Note:** For a new service channel, you must first create a new assignment rule and then [create a service channel](../../conversational-interfaces/advanced-work-assignment/awa-create-service-channel.md).


## Configure KPIs for service channels

Configure key performance indicators \(KPIs\) in service channels to your teams to track the ongoing work and real-time performance of teams.

### Before you begin

Role required: sn\_channel\_mgmt.admin

### About this task

Add the [channel Management reports](components-installed-configurable-wfo-cs.md) that are by default configured with Workforce Optimization for Customer Service or create a new KPI report that matters the most to you. Key performance indicators help managers perform the following actions:

-   Review real-time performance as the team is actively working on tasks across channels and queues.​
-   Track progress against KPIs and drill down into agents, team, and individual performance.​
-   Drill down into all queues and monitor ongoing cases, interactions, and tasks.
-   Jump in and support agents for help-requested work items using chat whisper or add work notes to a task.​
-   Refine data in the dashboard using the Assignment Group interactive filter without modifying the reports. For more information, see [Interactive Filters](../../now-intelligence/interactive-filters/c_HomepagePublishers.md).

The KPI scores are automatically refreshed at an interval of five seconds. However, you can modify the refresh interval by adding the **sn\_channel\_mgmt.kpi\_auto\_refresh.interval.seconds** [property](components-installed-configurable-wfo-cs.md) or choose to not automatically refresh using the **sn\_channel\_mgmt.channels\_card\_auto\_refresh.enable** [property](components-installed-configurable-wfo-cs.md). Also, the service channel cards refreshes automatically in 2 minutes as configured in the **sn\_channel\_mgmt.channel\_card\_auto\_refresh.interval.seconds** [system property](components-installed-configurable-wfo-cs.md) or you can manually refresh by clicking the Refresh \(![Refresh overview data icon](../image/refresh-sync-new.png)\) icon.
