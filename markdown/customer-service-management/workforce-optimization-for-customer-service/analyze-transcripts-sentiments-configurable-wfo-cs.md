# Analyze transcripts and sentiments for the Amazon Connect phone channel

Analyze your agent's call recordings, transcripts, and sentiment reports. With this information, you can assess the call quality and train your agents to handle calls better in the future.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cti\_core.user\_manager

## About this task

When an agent interacts with an external caller, the call gets recorded and transcribed. The application tags every statement within a transcript with a sentiment score. After a call has been completed, a sentiment report is automatically generated.

**Note:** The manager must have an active session with Amazon Connect to view the transcripts and sentiments. The transcripts and sentiments are generated in the Amazon Connect application. They are then displayed in the Channels application in Workforce Optimization for Customer Service.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Manager Workspace**.

2.  Select an interaction record to analyze transcripts and sentiments.
