# Synchronize team calendar with Microsoft Outlook

Managers and agents can synchronize their calendars and events with Microsoft Outlook.

As a user with admin role, you can enable this feature by installing Microsoft Exchange Online Spoke. See [Set up](../../integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-ms-exch-ol.md).

**Note:** Ensure that you grant the following Graph API permissions to synchronize Microsoft Outlook with team calendar.

|Permission|Type|
|----------|----|
|Calendars.ReadWrite|Delegated|
|Calendars.ReadWrite.Shared|Delegated|
|Calendars.ReadWrite|Application|

After installing Microsoft Exchange Online Spoke, set the **sn\_wfo\_outlook.enable\_outlook\_sync** system property to `true` in the System Properties \[sys\_properties\] table. Add the email IDs that you want to synchronize in the User \[sys\_user\] table.
