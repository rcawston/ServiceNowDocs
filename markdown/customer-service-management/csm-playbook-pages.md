# Playbook pages

Use playbook pages in CSM Configurable Workspace so that your agents can view the stages and activities in a playbook, work on activities, and have quick access to in-context information.

## Overview of templates, pages, and page variants

Pages provide the base structure for how the system displays record information in CSM Configurable Workspace. You can create and customize pages with [UI Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/ui-builder-overview.md), a web user interface builder.

A page template is a pre-defined page configuration. When you create a page in UI Builder, you can select a page template as a starting point. You can also create a page from scratch or by copying another page and then customizing the page to meet your needs.

A page variant is a version of a page that includes unique settings such as the audience, conditions, and page order. For more information about templates, pages, and page variants, see [Creating pages and page variants](config-csm-ws-create-page-variant.md#section_bt3_stk_1bc).

Pages and page variants can also include playbooks, which are created in Workflow Studio. A playbook provides step-by-step guidance for resolving a specific type of case. The workflows that are associated with a specific type of case and the activities that need to be completed to resolve cases of this type are detailed in the playbook.

## Playbook pages

The Playbooks for Customer Service Management plugin provides the following playbook pages:

-   [Case playbook: horizontal stages](csm-playbook-horizontal-stages.md) page
-   [Case playbook: vertical stages](csm-playbook-vertical-stages.md) page

Additional CSM playbook applications provide playbook pages that you can activate and use with case types in CSM Configurable Workspace.

|Application|Page variant|Description|
|-----------|------------|-----------|
|Case Playbook for Complaints v5.0|Complaint case process page|Includes a horizontal stage picker that provides an end-to-end view of the complaint process.|
|Case Playbook for Onboarding v5.0|Onboarding case process page|This playbook page includes a horizontal stage picker at the top of the record that provides an end-to-end view of the onboarding process.|
|Case Playbook for Product Support v4.0|Product Support process page|This playbook page includes a horizontal stage picker at the top of the record that provides an end-to-end view of the product support process.|

For more information, see [Playbook plugins](setting-up-csm-playbooks.md#section_qgq_ylk_llb).

**Note:** By default, playbook pages are read-only. To use a playbook page, [activate the page](activate-process-based-page.md) and set the page order.

## Benefits of using playbook pages

Resolving customer issues or requests often involves the execution of tasks across multiple users, departments, and systems. Different users are responsible for different tasks within the overall resolution process. Using playbooks provides the following benefits:

-   An experience that is tailored to customer service agents and other users.
-   Visibility into the overall resolution process, the current stage in the process, and the activities that need to be completed within that stage.
-   Access to in-context information.

If a playbook is configured to use the playbook record generator feature, an agent can create a record by using a playbook activity. Creating a record opens the playbook and initiates the first activity, which is to guide an agent through the record creation process.After saving the case, an agent moves to the next activity in the current stage or to the first activity in the next stage.
