A playbook experience is a defined set of configurations that determines how the system renders a playbook in Workspace. You can use playbook experiences to customize the look and feel of a playbook, map user actions, and override activities.The Playbook Experience plugin \(com.playbook\_experience\) includes the Global Playbook Experience record, which defines a default playbook configuration.

The Playbooks for Customer Service Management plugin \(com.sn\_csm\_playbook\) includes the following additional playbook experience records:

-   CSM Configurable Workspace Playbook
-   CSM Agent Workspace Playbook

Users with the system administrator role can select a playbook experience when adding a playbook to a page in UI Builder.

Different playbooks for the same record type can use different playbook experiences. For example, if a complaint case uses two playbooks, each playbook can use a different playbook experience.

</table>## Playbook experiences

Playbook experiences are used to customize the look and feel of a playbook. Settings in a playbook experience control how [UI Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/ui-builder-overview.md) renders a playbook in the CSM workspaces. System administrators can configure settings in the playbook experience record that determine the playbook stage and activity visibility.

Within UI Builder, system administrators can configure playbook component settings such as:

-   Selecting a playbook experience
-   Selecting an activity view
-   Enabling compact mode
