# Migrate to CSM Configurable Workspace

Follow the instructions in this topic to migrate from CSM Agent Workspace to CSM Configurable Workspace.

If you are currently using CSM Agent Workspace and want to migrate to CSM Configurable Workspace, you can continue using most of your existing configurations. Some features, however, need to be configured specifically for CSM Configurable Workspace. You can migrate some of the configurations using lists and forms and others using the [UI Builder](../application-development/ui-builder/ui-builder-overview.md) tool.

</table>Also, be aware that some configuration changes made for one workspace can also affect the other. For example, changes to the CSM Agent Workspace configuration may impact CSM Configurable Workspace. The same applies to changes to the CSM Configurable Workspace configuration, which may impact CSM Agent Workspace.

**Note:** For customers who are **not** currently using CSM Agent Workspace and want to implement CSM Configurable Workspace, use the CSM Configurable Workspace guided setup by navigating to **Customer Service** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Guided Setup** &gt; **CSM Configurable Workspace**. Clicking **Configure** in this category takes you to the Configurable Workspace guided setup. The information and instructions in the different guided setup categories can help you set up a new implementation of CSM Configurable Workspace.
