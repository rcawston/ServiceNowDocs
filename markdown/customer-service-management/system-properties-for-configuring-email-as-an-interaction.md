# System properties for configuring Email Interaction

You can manage certain workflows based on system properties, such as enabling or disabling the creation of email interactions for guest users. You can set an inactivity period after which email interactions are automatically closed. Configure the system to create single or multiple outbound email interactions when different agents contact the same customer, enable rerouting, and set reminder periods.

Navigate to **All****&gt;System Properties****&gt;All Properties** .

Alternatively, in your instance, enter `sys_properties.list` in the filter navigator and customize the Email Interaction system properties.

</td></tr><tr><td>

**period\_for\_reminders\_to\_customers\_interaction**

</td><td>

Specify the number of days after which an automatic email reminder is sent to customers. This value determines how long the system waits after receiving the last email response from the customer before sending a reminder.
