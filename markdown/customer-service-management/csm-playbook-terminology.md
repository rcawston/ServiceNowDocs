# Playbook terminology

Use the following list of terms to gain an understanding of playbook structure, tools, and configuration.

A playbook is an end-to-end workflow that includes the steps, strategies, and guidance to lead users through a business process. A playbook:

-   VISUALIZES a workflow in a task-oriented view and guides users through sequences of tasks.
-   INCLUDES a series of steps that a user must complete to achieve a particular goal.
-   PROVIDES guidance for completing those steps.

## Playbook structure

A playbook contains one or more stages, or groups of tasks, and sequences of activities within each stage. A playbook also includes a trigger. The structure of a playbook is created in [Workflow Studio](../build-workflows/workflow-studio/workflow-studio.md).

Customer service agents interact with playbooks in CSM Configurable Workspace. The record pages that display playbooks in a workspace are created or customized in [UI Builder](../application-development/ui-builder/ui-builder-overview.md). Different components make up the playbook record pages.
