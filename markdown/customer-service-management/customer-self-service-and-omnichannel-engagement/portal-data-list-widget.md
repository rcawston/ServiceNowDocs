For more information about how to configure the instance options for the Portal Data List widget, see [Add and configure the Portal Data List widget](config-data-list-widget-inst-optns.md).

The Data List portal widget can be used in the following scenarios:

-   Dynamic data list: Enables you to display records dynamically based on the configuration provided in the URL parameters. It avoids the need to create duplicate list pages. You can use a common page to display records from any table by passing the following URL parameters: table, filter, sort order, view, and target view page.
-   Static data list: Ability to display records from one or more tables specified in the widget instance options. It enables you to personalize the data list experience for a particular entity or table, such as cases, products, contacts, and so on.
-   Related data list: Enables you to display records associated with an entity on the record view page. The data list is configured to identify the entity specified in the URL and filters the records accordingly.
