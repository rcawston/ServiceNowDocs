# Install Conversational Appointment Booking

Install the Conversational Appointment Booking application \(sn\_va\_appt\_schedul\) if you have the admin role. The application installs related ServiceNow® Store applications and plugins if they are not already installed.

## Before you begin

-   Ensure that the application and all of its associated ServiceNow Store applications have valid ServiceNow entitlements. For more information, see [Get entitlement for a ServiceNow product or application](https://store.servicenow.com/$appstore.do#!/store/help?article=KB0030186).

Role required: admin

## About this task

Conversational Appointment Booking requires the following plugins. Ensure that these plugins are activated before you install Conversational Appointment Booking.

-   **Required ServiceNow plugins**
    -   **Walk-Up for CSM \(com.snc.walkup\_for\_csm\)**

        **Note:** Conversational Appointment Booking can be used without the Walk-Up for CSM plugin. However, custom control and Virtual Agent topic blocks shown in [Configure Conversational Appointment Booking](conv-appt-booking-config.md) cannot be used without this plugin.

        The following items are installed with this plugin:

        -   NLU model for Conversational Appointment Booking.

            **Note:** In order to use the NLU model, you need to train and publish the model. See [Natural Language Understanding](../../intelligent-experiences/nlu-service/nlu-landing.md) for more information.

        -   Virtual Agent topics: Schedule a Walk-up appointment, Reschedule a Walk-up appointment, and Cancel a Walk-up appointment.
        -   Virtual Agent topic blocks: Get Walk-up location and Walk-up appointment scheduling.
    -   **Appointment Booking \(com.snc.appointment\_booking\)**

        Enables the appointment booking feature for Walk-up Experience.

    -   **Glide Virtual Agent \(com.glide.cs.chatbot\)**

        Activates the Virtual Agent platform. Virtual Agent requires additional licensing. See [Virtual Agent](../../conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/virtual-agent-landing-page.md) for more information.

    -   **NLU Workbench \(com.snc.nlu\_studio\)**

        Enables the creation of custom ServiceNow Natural Language Understanding models used by Virtual Agent.

    -   **Studio \(com.glide.dev-studio\)**

        Used for adding and updating application files.
