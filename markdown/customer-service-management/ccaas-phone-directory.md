# Phone directory

Agents can use the phone directory integrated into their ServiceNow instance to make outbound calls to queues, other agents, and external numbers. They can also enter a phone number directly in the global call list window or use the phone directory to make calls.

## Phone directory overview

**Note:** The contact center admin must enable and configure the phone directory for the agents to view and use it in their global call list from their ServiceNow instance. Once the back end integration is done, the phone directory displays in CSM Configurable Workspace.

The following CCaaS Store Apps offer voice channel integration:

The phone directory helps agents make outbound calls to contacts within their organization and external numbers. Organizations can integrate with any third-party CCaaS call integration feature that allows agents to access their contacts and queues via their integrated contact center. The phone directory displays tabs for queue, agent contacts, and external contacts, and the contact center admin can configure the number of contacts displayed. Use **Search** on the phone directory to display a list of a maximum of 25 results at a time. The limit can be set by configuring the system property setting called ‘icc\_search\_limit’ using an integer value. The default minimum value is 10, and a limit can be set to return a maximum of 25 results according to list of queues, agents, or external data.
