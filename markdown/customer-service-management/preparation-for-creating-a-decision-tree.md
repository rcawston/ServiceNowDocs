# Preparation for creating a decision tree

Before configuring a decision tree, process analysts should document the flow of the decision tree using a flow chart including the questions, answers, associated paths, and guidance.

Anita, who is a process analyst at the StellarVest bank wants to create a decision tree that enables agents to troubleshoot a failed credit card transaction.

Anita first creates a flowchart to document the flow of a decision tree to determine the questions, answers, and possible guidance to configure.
