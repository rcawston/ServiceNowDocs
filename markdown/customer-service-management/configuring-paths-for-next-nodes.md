# Configuring paths with conditions whether the amount is debited or not

Configure paths with conditions to determine the next question or guidance node that is displayed in a decision tree.

-   If any amount is debited during a failed transaction, the path that leads to the Initiate transaction tracking guidance is taken.
-   If no amount is debited during a failed transaction, the path that leads to the next question node is taken.

## Configure the path for the amount-debited condition

Configure a path for the amount-debited condition for the next guidance node.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin, sn\_gd\_core.decision\_tree\_author

### About this task

When a customer answers that the amount is debited from the credit card, the path that leads to the Initiate transaction tracking guidance is taken.

### Procedure

1.  In Decision Tree Builder, select the Add path icon \(![Add path icon](../image/icon-add-path.png)\) on the start node.

    A new path and a new node are added to the canvas.

2.  Select the new path.

3.  In the **Path name** field, enter `Amount is debited`.

4.  In the **Path priority** field, enter `100`.

5.  Select the appropriate fields to set the condition "Has any amount been debited? \| is \| true".

6.  Select **Save and close**.


### What to do next

[Configure a guidance node](configure-guidance-node-initiate-transaction-tracking.md) that allows agents to initiate the transaction tracking for a failed transaction.

## Configure the path for the amount-not-debited condition

Configure a path for the amount-not-debited condition for the next question node.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin, sn\_gd\_core.decision\_tree\_author

### About this task

When a customer answers that the amount isn’t debited from the credit card, the path that leads to the next question node is taken. The question node asks for failure codes that the user received.

2.  Select the new path.

3.  In the **Path name** field, enter `Amount is not debited`.

4.  In the **Path priority** field, enter `200`.

5.  Select the appropriate fields to set the condition "Has any amount been debited? \| is \| false".

6.  Select **Save and close**.


### What to do next

[Configure a question node](configure-question-node-to-ask-failure-codes.md) to ask for the failure codes that customer received after the failed transaction.
