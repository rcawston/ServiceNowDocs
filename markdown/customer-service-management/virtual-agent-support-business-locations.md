# Virtual Agent support for business locations

Customer service agents receive chat requests from your business location staff members on the CSM Agent Workspace. These agents can assist your staff members to resolve issues and manage the cases more efficiently if your staff members fill out a pre-chat survey first.

## Overview of pre-chat survey

Before your staff members can use a pre-chat survey to initiate a chat, your administrator must activate the pre-chat configuration for the Business Location Service Portal. The preconfigured surveys are activated by default in the base system. If your business location has upgraded the system to manually activate the pre-chat configuration, then staff members can fill in the pre-survey before the chat. To learn more about the pre-chat survey, see [Pre-chat surveys](csm-pre-chat-overview.md).

You must also assign the service organization contributor \(sn\_customerservice.service\_organization\_contributor\) and location manager \(sn\_customerservice.svc\_location\_manager\_core\) roles to the staff members using the pre-survey chat feature.

Let's say that a staff member with the correct role fills out a pre-chat survey on the Business Location Service Portal \(BLSP\). The chat is then assigned to a customer service agent or Virtual Agent via the advanced work assignment \(AWA\) routing. To learn more about AWA, see [Exploring Advanced Work Assignment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/advanced-work-assignment/awa-overview.md).

Before entering into a chat conversation with the staff member, the assigned agent reviews the context of the case so that agents know how to handle the case.

## Pre-chat survey

The pre-chat survey lets staff provide location and support details before a chat. It gives agents context about the case, enabling them to assist more effectively. The pre-chat survey makes the chat more efficient and helpful to your staff. To learn more about how a chat is initiated from the BLSP, see [Chat with Virtual Agent from the Business Location Service Portal](agent-chat-business-location-service-portal.md).

The pre-chat survey isn't displayed for service organization contributors who are associated with a single business location. The location is picked by default.

The business locations that are listed in the pre-chat configuration are limited to the locations that are assigned to the business location manager. You can't select a child business location.

To learn more about the configuration of the pre-chat surveys, see [Define pre-chat survey configurations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/ac-configure-pre-chat-surveys.md).
