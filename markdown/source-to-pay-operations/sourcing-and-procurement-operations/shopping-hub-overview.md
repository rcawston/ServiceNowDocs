# Shopping Hub

Shopping Hub \(sn\_spend\_uib\) is a self-service procurement portal that employees use to purchase products and services. It supports browsing internal catalog items and supplier catalogs, submitting purchase requests, and tracking orders from checkout through fulfillment.

Shopping Hub is part of the Sourcing and Procurement Operations \(SPO\) application and runs on the Next Experience UI Framework.

## Shopper workflow

A typical purchase in Shopping Hub begins with product discovery. You can browse the catalog by category or by supplier, or enter search terms to locate a specific product or service. Selecting a product opens its detail page, where pricing, availability, supplier information, and product attributes are available for review.

After adding products to the cart, you proceed to checkout to specify delivery details, a payment method, and a cost center. The full checkout flow supports per-product delivery date and location customization. After submitting the purchase, the portal creates a purchase order or requisition depending on the procurement configuration.

You monitor purchase status in **My Purchases**. If the procurement workflow generates tasks, such as approval actions, receipt confirmations, or supplier selections, those tasks appear in **My Tasks** for you to complete. For frequently purchased items, the **Buy Again** option in **My Purchases** shortens the process by pre-populating cart and checkout details from a previous order.
