# Work on a sourcing event

You can work on a sourcing event and complete an entire workflow, right from starting negotiations with multiple suppliers, to awarding one or multiple suppliers, or rejecting bids. Awarding suppliers create purchase requisitions for the selected suppliers and items.

## Before you begin

Ensure that you’ve qualified all the suppliers involved in the sourcing event before you start negotiating with them. You can add additional relevant sourcing requests and qualified suppliers to the ongoing sourcing event, as and when required, when working on the event. This allows you to manage complex negotiation activities. Adding a sourcing request or supplier auto-creates purchase lines and creates a new negotiation record to manage negotiation activities for that specific supplier.

Role required: sn\_shop.procurement\_specialist

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Procurement Case Management** &gt; **Source-to-Pay Workspace**.

2.  On the list page, navigate to **Review needed** &gt; **Sourcing event: ready to negotiate**.

3.  Select and open the sourcing event that you plan to work on.

4.  Select **Start negotiating**.

    The sourcing event moves to the Work in Progress state.

5.  Select **Add sourcing requests** if you want to add more similar sourcing requests to this sourcing event.

6.  Select **Add suppliers** if you want to add more suppliers to this sourcing event.

7.  On the **Purchase Lines** tab, update the **Negotiated unit cost** field for each purchase line.

    This moves the purchase request lines to the Pricing Obtained state.

8.  On the **Negotiations** tab, select **Finish negotiating** for each negotiation.

    This moves the sourcing event and all its associated negotiations, sourcing requests, and purchase lines to the Requires Decision state.

9.  Do one of these actions.
