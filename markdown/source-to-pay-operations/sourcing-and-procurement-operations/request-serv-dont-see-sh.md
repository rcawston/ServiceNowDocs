6.  Select **Submit**.

    Individual sourcing requests are created for each service that you've requested for, with individual lines for the selected suppliers.


## What to do next

View your sourcing request details from the **Requested items** tab, where a complete summary of your request lines is displayed. You can also view the details from the My Purchases page in Shopping Hub.

In case of errors, check your system logs to detect any issues with the record producer submission. ​However, if you were able to submit successfully, check your event logs to verify whether the asynchronous event sn\_shop.process\_non\_catalog\_sourcing was triggered to initiate creation of the sourcing requests.
