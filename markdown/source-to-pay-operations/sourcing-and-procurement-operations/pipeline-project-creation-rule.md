# Pipeline project creation rule for high-value sourcing requests

By default, the Pipeline project creation rule decision table is used to create pipeline projects automtatically in Sourcing Pipeline Management.

**Note:** You must have the `sn_spend_pipeline.pipeline_management_admin` role to update the Pipeline project creation rule decision table configuration.

The `sn_spend_pipeline.pipeline_management_admin` role contains the `decision_table_admin` role, which enables you to create, read, edit, and delete decision table inputs, columns, and values. For more information about configuring decision tables, see [Configuring decision tables](../../build-workflows/workflow-studio/configuring-decision-builder.md).

When a shopper requests pricing for items exceeding $250,000 through ShoppingHub, the following decision inputs are automatically evaluated to apply the rule conditions:

-   Sourcing request \[sn\_shop\_sourcing\_activity\]
-   Purchase line \[sn\_shop\_purchase\_line\]

The Pipeline project creation rule is applied to the Budget field in the Sourcing Request \(SR\). This rule determines whether a pipeline project should be created for the SR based on the following conditions:

-   If the amount exceeds $250,000 USD, a pipeline project is created.
-   If the amount is $250,000 USD or less, a pipeline project isn’t created.

**Note:** If the currency is different from the USD, it's converted to USD before the rule conditions are applied.
