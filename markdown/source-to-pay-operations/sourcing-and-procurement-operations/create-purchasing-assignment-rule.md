# Create a purchasing assignment rule

Automatically assign a sourcing request, negotiation, or purchase requisition to a procurement specialist user or a task fulfiller’s group based on pre-defined conditions by using a purchasing assignment rule.

## Before you begin

To create a purchasing assignment rule, you must have set up your product catalog \(with the necessary product categories, product models, and supplier products\) and should be able to raise a purchase request. For more information on how to set up your product catalog, see [Create a product category](create-product-model-categories.md), [Create a product model](create-product-models.md), and [Add a supplier product](add-supplier-product.md). You should have also set up user attributes on the sys\_user record appropriately.
