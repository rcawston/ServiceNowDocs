# Submit multi-product sourcing requests

Requesters can submit sourcing requests with multiple products in a single sourcing intake form. When a sourcing request form contains multiple products, the third-party sourcing solution automatically creates individual sourcing events for each product.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_shop.shopper

## About this task

When a requester submits a sourcing intake form with multiple products, the third-party sourcing solution automatically:

-   Creates individual sourcing request for each product.
-   Maps each sourcing request to its own sourcing event.
-   Links all sourcing requests to a single purchase record.
-   Synchronizes data to the third-party tool, generating a separate Request for Quote \(RFQ\) for each sourcing request.
-   Updates third-party RFQ data, such as RFx ID, RFx status, and RFx URL, in the corresponding sourcing request and sourcing event.

2.  Select the **Purchases and expenses** drop-down list and select **Purchase request**.
