# Purchasing tasks and procurement cases

All automated purchasing tasks and procurement cases are created using flow designer from the Service Delivery Common \(SDC\) application. The flow designer uses the underlying task and case generation decision tables, and purchasing tasks and procurement cases are created based on the conditions defined in the decision tables.

## Conditions and triggers for task and case creation

While the **Sourcing decision dependent on case** and **Order dependent on case** fields in the Finance Case table determine the need for a [procurement case](spo-glossary.md#) to be created, the **Sourcing decision dependent on task** and **Order dependent on task** fields in the Finance Task table determine the need for a [procurement task](spo-glossary.md#) to be created.

Tasks and cases are generated when the following rules are triggered, with the decision tables supporting this generation via decision inputs.

-   Purchase Requisition Task and Case Generation Rule
-   Sourcing Request Task and Case Generation Rule
-   Negotiation Task and Case Generation Rule
-   Sourcing Event Task and Case Generation Rule

## Procurement case types

Here’s a list of the types and subtypes of procurement cases:

-   Edit a purchase
-   Edit a receipt
-   GL Coding Review
-   Budget Review
-   Contract Review
-   Send NDA for Signature
-   Return a purchase
-   Replace a purchase
-   Request a Corporate Card
-   Inquiry
-   Delivery Address Review
-   Request a copy of contract
-   Due Diligence

For procurement cases, you can also create child cases or associate child cases to parent cases. However, remember that you must close all child cases and associated child cases before you can close any parent case. Similarly, you can reopen a child case or associated child case only when the parent case is still open.

## Procurement case states

The states that are available for a procurement case are listed.

-   Draft
-   Processing Case
-   In Review
-   On Hold
-   Work in Progress
-   Closed Canceled
-   Closed Rejected
-   Closed Completed
-   Awaiting Acceptance

When the condition in the **Enable case resolution acceptance** decision table is set to **True**, the procurement case state automatically changes to **Awaiting Acceptance** after the fulfiller sets it to **Closed Completed**.

The requestor gets an email notification to accept or reject the resolution within a set time.

-   If the requestor accepts the case resolution, a predefined email is generated for them to send and the case automatically changes to **Closed Completed**.
-   If the requestor rejects the case resolution, the case moves back to **Work in Progress**.
-   If the requestor does not respond in time, the case is automatically marked as **Closed Completed**.

For more information on email notifications, see [Alerts and email notifications from ShoppingHub](alerts-messages-email-notifications.md#awaiting_acceptance_email_notification).

## Purchasing task types

You can also create child tasks or associate child tasks to parent tasks. However, remember that you must close all child tasks and associated child tasks before you can close any parent task. Similarly, you can reopen a child task or associated child task only when the parent task is still open.
