# Alerts and email notifications from ShoppingHub

Several alerts and email notifications are triggered from ShoppingHub. This may be a result of your action, an assignment for you, or to keep you updated on the status of your purchases, including blanket contracts.

## Alerts

You receive an alert triggered from ShoppingHub when:

-   You switch the user that you’re shopping as in ShoppingHub
-   You switch to shop as someone else's delegate
-   You submit a revision
-   You complete a to-do that isn't an approval
-   You approve a purchase
-   You reject an approval
-   ShoppingHub has a global fail or fails to complete an action, due to server issue

## Email notifications

ShoppingHub sends out emails in a predefined template and uses flow designer to trigger the different email conditions. You can use the deep links that are provided in the emails to view relevant details. You’re notified through email when:

-   You submit a purchase request, irrespective of approval requirement \(for one or multiple purchase lines\)
-   You submit a new purchase request from a third-party site​.
-   Your delegate submits a purchase request, irrespective of approval requirement \(for one or multiple purchase lines\)
-   You submit a purchase request, irrespective of approval requirement that is automatically merged with an existing purchase request \(for one or multiple purchase lines\)
-   A purchase request that triggers an approval rule, is submitted, and you’re assigned as an approver for that purchase.

    **Note:** As an approver, you can approve the purchase from the email itself. For details, see [Approval email notification templates](approval-email-notifications-template.md).

    **Note:** The requestor gets an email notification with options to accept or reject the case resolution within a set time. The admin can set this time limit by navigating to **All &gt; Finance Common &gt; S2P Custom Configuration &gt; Case resolution acceptance config** and updating the `auto_close_in_days` value to an integer greater than 1 in the **Script** column. To turn off the email notifications, the admin can set the `email_acceptance` value to **False**. The requestor can also respond directly in the Employee Center by clicking **View case details**. For more information on procurement case states and approve request from Employee Center, see [Procurement case states](purchasing-tasks.md#procurement-case-states) and [Approve a request from Employee Center](approve-request-from-employee-center.md).


You can adjust the email trigger conditions and content in flow designer or email scripts, if necessary. You can also choose to fetch and use other details that aren’t displayed in the email by default, such as order type for purchase requisitions, product type or request type for sourcing requests, and so on. For detailed information on email templates and how to work with them, see [Email templates](../../platform-administration/c_EmailTemplates.md). You can also configure the email layout, and change the background color or font color, for example. The html field in the email layout record must be modified to achieve this. For detailed information on email layouts and how to work with them, see [Email layouts](../../platform-administration/email-layouts.md).
