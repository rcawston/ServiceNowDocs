# Sourcing events

Sourcing events represent the type of sourcing activity needed to negotiate with each supplier, and track the individual negotiations with each supplier. They help sourcing managers manage multi-supplier and multi-product negotiations.

Instead of individually managing negotiations of similar item requests from various suppliers who provide that item, sourcing managers can create a sourcing event for a negotiation intent or objective to manage multi-supplier and multi-product negotiations. Multiple negotiations and sourcing requests can be mapped to a single sourcing event as child entities.

Through this sourcing event, the sourcing managers can view and effectively manage the progress of the negotiations created for each supplier​. They can also discuss, follow, update, or cancel the event, as required. Further, they can award a single supplier or multiple suppliers, or even reject bids by selecting **Award**, **Award multiple suppliers**, or **Reject bids** respectively. Selecting **Award multiple suppliers** redirects them to the Source-to-Pay Workspace, where they can complete the process. For more information on this, see [Award multiple suppliers from a sourcing event](award-multiple-suppliers-from-a-ne.md).

Sourcing events can be best viewed from the Source-to-Pay Workspace list page.
