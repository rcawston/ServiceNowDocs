# Spend and Savings Management

Category management is a strategic procurement approach that involves managing a group of related products or services to maximize value, optimize costs, and enhance supplier relationships. Essentially, it’s the structured management of category taxonomy, ensuring that goods and services are categorized, sourced, and managed efficiently to drive better decision-making and operational efficiency.

The Spend and Savings Management \(sn\_spend\_mgmt\) feature enables category managers to import and manage their organization's category taxonomy. By incorporating this taxonomy into the ServiceNow system, category managers can streamline procurement processes, track spending, and evaluate savings more effectively at the category level.

**Important:** Check your entitlements to determine whether you have access to Spend and Savings Management.

The Spend and Savings Management application offers the following key benefits:

-   **Cost optimization**: Analyze spending across categories to identify areas for cost reduction through better supplier negotiations, volume discounts, and contract optimization.
-   **Improved visibility**: Categorize spend to gain insights into where money is being spent, enabling better decision-making and control over expenses.
-   **Strategic sourcing**: Consolidate spend within specific categories to achieve better pricing and terms with suppliers.
-   **Risk management**: Identify potential supplier risks early on by closely monitoring spend within categories and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.
-   **Enhanced procurement efficiency**: Streamline the procurement process by focusing on key categories, reducing unnecessary administrative tasks.
-   **Data-driven decision making**: Use data analytics to identify trends and make informed procurement decisions based on category performance.
