# Track risk assessments from the due diligence playbook

As procurement specialists, use the due diligence playbook to track supplier risk assessments and complete the associated tasks.

## Before you begin

Role required: Procurement specialist

## About this task

When a sourcing request is added to a sourcing event, in the Qualification needed state, a supplier case of type due diligence is triggered to address risk assessments. You can choose to close the case through the playbook if there are duplicate requests. In case of no duplicates, a new due diligence is initiated through the playbook. The same Third-Party Risk Management \(TPRM\) record producer is used here. You are notified at each step in the TPRM workflow, such as inherent risk assessment, third-party risk assessment, and so on. You can review the risk rating after the due diligence is complete. Now, you can either accept or reject the risk rating, and take necessary actions based on this decision. Select **Mark Complete** to close the due diligence case.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Procurement Case Management** &gt; **Source-to-Pay Workspace**.

2.  Select the List icon \(![List icon.](../../supplier-lifecycle-operations/image/cases-list-icon.png)\) and select **All work** &gt; **Cases**.
