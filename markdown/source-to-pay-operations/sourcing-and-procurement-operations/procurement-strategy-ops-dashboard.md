# Procurement Strategy &amp; Ops Dashboard

Visually analyze how your organization is placed strategically and operationally, over a given period of time.

**Note:** This dashboard is available only if you install the Performance Analytics for Sourcing and Procurement Operations application.

You can use the Procurement Strategy &amp; Ops Dashboard to view your organization's strategic performance, which includes year-to-date total spend, spend categorization, total savings, negotiation outcomes, spend by category and supplier, and utilization of active blanket purchase orders. On the operations side, you can view your organization's open sourcing requests, negotiations, expiring contracts, and purchase requisitions and their details. You can filter by cost center or department and select specific elements to view relevant details.

On the SLA side, you can view the basic cycle times for different record types, time taken for each state, comparison of breached versus unbreached records, breached time in comparison with standard SLA time, and team performance in terms of processing records and also the excess time taken for breached records. You can filter the records by task type.

**Note:** The widgets plot metrics or data from the day the upgrade is taken, as the triggers for collecting metrics are enabled only after the upgrade. So, historical data isn’t available automatically after the upgrade but is accumulated thereafter. Also, if any new case types are introduced in the system and you want to add its metrics to the SLA dashboard, ensure that you update the indicator source.
