# ITAM shipment field and state mappings to SPO

Lists the field and state mappings between ITAM Shipment records and SPO Shipment records.

## Field mappings

Shipment records created in asset management have corresponding readN/Aonly records created on the SPO shipment details table. ITAM shipment state mappings are driven by the ITAM shipment table, which contains conditional logic. The SPO shipment table is readN/Aonly.
