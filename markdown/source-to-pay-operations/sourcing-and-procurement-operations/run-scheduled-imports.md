# Run scheduled imports

A scheduled import allows administrators to import data on a regular schedule. Run import operations on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis based on your business requirements. Scheduled import runs a datasource similar to how a scheduler job runs the script.

## Before you begin

Role required: import\_scheduler, import\_admin, or admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Import Sets** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **** &gt; **Scheduled Imports**.

    A list of available scheduled imports appears with Run, Data source, Active, and Updated information.

2.  Select **Example File Based Catalog Import**

3.  Follow the steps for [data import](../../integrate-applications/system-import-sets/t_ScheduleADataImport.md).


## What to do next

-   You can verify the data transfer records from **Procurement Integrations** &gt; **Catalog** &gt; **FTP Catalog Imports**. You can see all the data as one single payload content. See Payloads for more information.
-   The same record is then transformed and available from **Procurement Integrations** &gt; **Catalog** &gt; **Catalog Imports**.
