# Sourcing request

A sourcing request is created for when an item that a shopper, employee, or requester needs, must be sourced. This record is created when an active contractual price for the product that the shopper intends to purchase doesn’t exist. This includes items in both the product catalog and off-catalog.

A purchase line is created, which is then grouped into a sourcing request. Sourcing requests are grouped by product models.

As a procurement specialist or sourcing manager:

-   To view all sourcing requests from the Source-to-Pay Workspace, navigate to **All** &gt; **Procurement Case Management** &gt; **Source-to-Pay Workspace**, and select the List icon \(![List icon.](../../supplier-lifecycle-operations/image/cases-list-icon.png)\), followed by **All team work** &gt; **Sourcing Requests**.
-   To view all sourcing requests from the Platform, navigate to **Sourcing and Purchasing Automation** &gt; **All Work**, and select **All Sourcing Requests**.
-   To view sourcing requests assigned to you from the Platform, navigate to **Sourcing and Purchasing Automation** &gt; **My Work**, and select **My Sourcing Requests**.

After the shopper places a request for a catalog or non-catalog item from ShoppingHub, the information that the shopper provides is mapped to the fields of a sourcing request as follows:

</table>## Sourcing and negotiation workflow

![Sourcing and negotiation workflow](../image/sourcing-workflow.png)

After a sourcing request is created, the procurement specialist can create a purchasing task of the subtype **Ask a question** if more details are needed from the shopper.

The procurement specialist can decide if a negotiation for this purchase can be created or not. If time doesn’t permit for a negotiation, the supplier can be contacted directly for pricing details. After the suppliers respond with their quotes, a purchasing task is systematically created requesting the shopper to select a supplier to award. This is a sourcing task of the subtype **Select a supplier**. For an awarded supplier, the Awarded column value of a purchase line is automatically set to **Yes**, and this creates an associated purchase requisition.

A shopper can select **Cancel** to update the status of the sourcing request and its associated purchase lines to Closed Canceled.

## Sourcing request state flows

Let's consider a simple scenario where qualification is needed. If a price is entered on a purchase line \(PRL\), the PRL indicates that the price has been added or updated, and moves to the Pricing Obtained state, where it remains in that state. All the other PRLs without price and the sourcing request \(SR\) continue to remain in the Qualification Needed state. Once qualified, the SR and other PRLs that are in the Qualification Needed state move to the Qualified state, while the PRL that had price remain in the Pricing Obtained state.

Manually creating a new PRL re-triggers the qualification flow. If pricing has been added to this PRL, the PRL remains in the Pricing Obtained state while qualification work is being done. The SR also remains in the Qualification Needed state, as needed.

When sourcing events \(NEs\) and negotiations \(NEGs\) are considered in the sourcing flow, consider the following scenarios:

-   Qualification is needed, where NE is in the Planned state, and NEG, SR, and PRL are all in the Qualification Needed state:

    If a price is entered on a PRL, the PRL indicates that the price has been added or updated, and moves to the Pricing Obtained state, where it remains in that state. All the other PRLs without price and the SR continue to remain in the Qualification Needed state. Once qualified, the SR and other PRLs that are in the Qualification Needed state move to the Qualified state, while the PRL that had price remain in the Pricing Obtained state.

-   NEG is in progress, where NE is in WIP, and NEG, SR, and PRL are all in the Negotiation in Progress state:

    If a price is entered on a PRL when NEG is in progress, the PRL indicates that the price has been added or updated, and moves to the Pricing Obtained state, where it remains in that state. All the other PRLs without price and the NEG and SR remain in the Negotiation in Progress state, while the NE remains in WIP.

-   New SRs or suppliers are added after **Start negotiating** is selected on the NE, where NE is in WIP, and NEG, SR, and PRL are all in the Negotiation in Progress state:

    This triggers qualification cases to be evaluated on the affected PRLs and move the NEG to Qualification Needed. If qualification isn’t needed, both the NEGs and the newly created PRLs remain in the Negotiation in Progress state.

    If qualification is needed, NEs remain in WIP even when new SRs or existing suppliers are added. Once qualification cases are complete, Individual NEGs automatically move from Qualified to Negotiation in Progress, without the need to re-select **Start negotiating** on the NE. The newly evaluated PRLs also move to Negotiation in Progress.

    However, at any point, if a price is entered on any of the newly created PRLs, the PRL indicates that the price has been added or updated, and moves to the Pricing Obtained state, where it remains in that state.
