# Review your service acknowledgment task from Employee Center

Review and acknowledge the receipt status of your ordered service from your supplier from Employee Center.

## Before you begin

Service acknowledgment tasks are auto-created the first time on purchase order creation, and are triggered on a monthly basis by the Create Service Acknowledgment Task scheduled job. This scheduled job automatically picks all purchase order lines that have started and are yet to reach their end dates, and have some remaining amount or percentage or quantity to be delivered.

To review your service acknowledgments, your service request should have been reviewed and approved by a Procurement Specialist and converted to a purchase order. Only then, this task is displayed to you on Employee Center.
