For more information on these applications and their dependencies, see [Application plugin installation sequence in Sourcing and Procurement Operations](application-plugin-list.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  In the search bar, use the filter criteria to find the application.

    You can search for the application by its name or ID. If you can't find an application, you can request it from the ServiceNow Store. Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/store-release-notes/page/release-notes/store/sn-store-release-notes.html).

3.  Select **Install**.

4.  In the Application installation dialog box, review the application dependencies.

    If your application requires other applications, you must install them first if they are not already installed.

    If the dependent applications or plugins are not installed already, installing your application automatically installs them.

5.  Select **Load demo data** if demo data is available and you want to install it.

    Some applications include demo data, which are sample records that describe application features for common use cases. Load demo data when you first install the application on a development or test instance.

6.  Select **Install**.
