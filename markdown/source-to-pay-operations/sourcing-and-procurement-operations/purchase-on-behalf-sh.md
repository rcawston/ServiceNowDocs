# Purchase on behalf of another user in Shopping Hub

Shoppers can purchase products and services on behalf of another user in Shopping Hub. When purchasing on behalf of another user, shoppers can also view the carts and purchases associated with that user. A shopper who is authorized to purchase on behalf of other users is referred to as a super shopper.

## Key benefits

This functionality provides the following benefits:

-   Shopping controls allow administrators to define purchasing eligibility, ensuring that restricted products cannot be purchased.
-   Checkout is allowed only if the product can be shipped to the delivery location of the user on whose behalf the purchase is made. If shipping is not supported, Shopping Hub prevents the purchase from being submitted.
-   Shoppers purchasing on behalf of other users can easily view those users’ carts and purchases by selecting the user name from the filter list.

</table>## How to configure

Role required: sn\_shop.shopping\_hub\_admin

Plugin required: Shopping Hub \(sn\_spend\_uib\)

Ensure that you configure the super shopper to purchase on behalf of other users. For more information, see [Enable a shopper to purchase on behalf of another user](config-shoppinghub-purchase-behalf.md).

## How it works

The following points describe how this capability works:

To make a purchase on behalf of another user, select a product and then select the **Purchase on behalf of** check box. From the **On behalf of** list, select the user for whom the purchase is being made \(for example, Andrew Griffin\).

![Shopping Hub product page showing "Purchase on behalf of" checkbox with "Andrew Griffin" selected.](../image/sh-purchase-behalf-field.png)

After **Request to buy** is selected, the system displays the relevant details configured for the selected user, such as cost center and delivery location. These details can be modified before the request is submitted.

![Request to buy dialog showing purchase details for Andrew Griffin with delivery and cost center options.](../image/sh-purchase-behalf-details.png)

After the request is submitted, the purchase is available in My purchases. By default, the page displays purchases made by you. You can use the filter to view purchases made on behalf of other users.

Tasks are not automatically assigned to the person the item was purchased for. To ensure they can confirm receipt of the item, make sure the selected address includes the business owner’s name in the **Recipient** field. For all other tasks, the procurement specialist can reassign ownership to the business owner.

If the **sn\_spend\_uib.purchased\_bahealf.enable.card.actions** system property is set to true, all available card options are displayed for purchases made on behalf of other users. If the property is set to false, only the View purchase option is available.

You can also view the carts of users on whose behalf you are making purchases.

![Shopping cart interface showing user drop-down with Shirley Ross and Warren Summers options.](../image/sh-purchase-behalf-cart.png)

If a user is selected from the **Shopping for** list \(for example, Warren Summers\), the **Purchase on behalf of** check box is disabled. In this case, Shopping Hub automatically sets the purchasing capability to the selected user only.
