# Procurement Case Management

With the Procurement Case Management application, you can enable your employees to submit procurement cases and access your organization's knowledge base. You can also enable your procurement teams to automate their fulfillment processes so that they can manage and monitor the progress of their tasks.

The Procurement Case Management \(PCM\) application enables you to manage the complete life cycle of the procurement process.

By using the PCM application, your organization gets the following benefits:

-   Procurement process optimization for task routing and tracking the progress of your tasks.
-   Knowledge article publish and performance workflows.
-   Visibility into the processes, progress, and overall efficiency of the procurement process.
-   Integration with IT Asset Management, Software Asset Management, and Contract Management.

## Installed plugins

Install Procurement Case Management from the ServiceNow Store.

The Procurement Case Management \(sn\_spend\_psd\) application installs the following dependent plugins:

-   Common Service Delivery \(sn\_spend\_sdc\)

-   Source-to-Pay Workspace \(sn\_spend\_workspace\)


## Required roles

You can configure the following roles and tasks:

-   sn\_spend\_psd.psd\_admin: Configure and make changes to the system properties, such as creating request types and categories.

    **Note:** An application-specific admin role enables a user to manage application-level configurations, roles, and access controls. Your system-level admin on the production instance must grant the application-specific admin role to the appropriate users, and then remove the application-specific admin role from all users with the system-level admin role to help prevent system-level admins from viewing sensitive application data via forms, lists, and the UI. For more information, see [Application administration](../../application-development/application-administration.md).

-   sn\_spend\_psd.manager: View, create, and update procurement cases and tasks.
-   sn\_spend\_psd.agent: Manage the workflows for fulfilling requests and knowledge articles.
-   sn\_spend\_psd.procurement\_task\_owner: Access and complete task assignments to fulfill the requests.
-   sn\_spend\_psd.requestor: Create procurement cases.

Work prioritization automatically assigns a priority level to purchase requisitions, sourcing requests, and procurement cases so that procurement specialists can work the most urgent items first.

As a procurement specialist or Procurement Case Management \(PCM\) agent, you would want to engage with suppliers who are qualified to fulfill your organization's purchasing needs.
