# Purchase requisition

A purchase requisition represents a request that is sent internally within an organization to obtain purchased goods or services. It consists of items that need to be ordered, and may need to go through approvals for a purchase order to be created.

A purchase requisition is created in either of the following scenarios:

-   When a shopper selects **Request to buy** from a product details page on ShoppingHub.
-   When a supplier is selected after providing quotes in a sourcing request.

Through a purchase requisition, the purchasing department understands details of the items that are requested, the quantity, supplier, cost, and reason for purchase.![Purchase requisition.](../image/create_purchase_requisition.png)
