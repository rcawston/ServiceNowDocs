# Purchase requisition, purchase order, and sourcing request states

Purchase requisitions, purchase orders, and sourcing requests move through a series of states as they progress through the procurement lifecycle. Each state reflects the current stage of processing and determines what actions are available.

## How states are determined

The state of a purchase requisition, purchase order, or sourcing request is calculated automatically based on the states of its associated lines. When a line changes state, the system recalculates and updates the parent record's state. You cannot set the state of these records directly.

When procurement cases or purchasing tasks are associated with a record, the state reflects whether those items are still open. For example, a purchase requisition remains in the Awaiting Task Completion state until all order-dependent cases and tasks are closed.

## Purchase requisition states

The following table describes each purchase requisition state, when the state is set, and where the purchase requisition can move from that state.

<table><thead><tr><th>
