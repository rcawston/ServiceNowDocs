# Procurement File Transfer Framework

Procurement File Transfer Framework \(PFTF\) helps you transfer information between the ServiceNow database and a third-party reseller through a File Transfer Protocol \(FTP\). You can set up an FTP server for access and transfer of reseller data without any spoke development by the third-party reseller.

When the PFTF application is installed, the following applications from the ServiceNow IntegrationHub Professional Pack Installer must be auto-installed. This is a prerequisite.

-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Action Step - SSH
-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Action Step - SFTP
-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Flow Trigger - REST

FTP integration helps when you intend to transfer files between ServiceNow and your resellers.

Use Procurement File Transfer Framework for the following activities:

-   Support the FTP-based integration for suppliers.
-   Standardize the file structure, formats, and naming conventions for each supplier.
-   Manage large-scale data through FTP import and export.
-   Simplify the import and export operations with mid server and flow designer.
-   Use the file transfer workflows to control the data operations.

Currently, the following integrations are supported:

**Imports**:

-   Catalog import
-   Order acknowledgment import
-   Shipment import
-   Invoice import

**Exports**: Order export

Your suppliers can upload the files with the recommended [folder](data-sources-info.md) structure and format on the server. ServiceNow imports and exports all the details automatically through scheduled data imports and exports.

-   **[Third‑party registration for PIF and PFTF integrations](third-party-registration-for-pif-pftf.md)**  
Third‑party registration enables you to configure supplier integrations for Source-to-Pay Integration Framework \(PIF\) and Procurement File Transfer Framework \(PFTF\).
-   **[Import data using FTP server](ftp-data-import.md)**  
Import a file from a local source, a remote network server, or another instance by providing a path and authentication information. Transfer and manage procurement data in a principled structure that administrators can use for various data management operations.
-   **[Perform export steps](validate-errors.md)**  
Export a file from a local source, a remote network server, or another instance by providing a path and authentication information.
-   **[Data source table information](data-sources-info.md)**  
The following information can help you with the FTP import and export data.
