# Providing Order and Shipping Confirmation URLs to Punchout Suppliers

When integrating with a punchout supplier, customers are required to provide specific URLs for Order Confirmation and Shipping Confirmation.

These URLs must be configured correctly to confirm seamless communication between the customer's instance and the punchout supplier’s system.

</td></tr><tr><td>

</table>Where:
