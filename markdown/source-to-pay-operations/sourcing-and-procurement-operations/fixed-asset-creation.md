# Fixed asset creation

As a procurement administrator, you can create fixed assets for products that are purchased for long-term use and are not likely to be converted quickly into cash.

Fixed asset creation is automated when capitalization policy criteria are satisfied. To ensure that fixed assets are created automatically on creation of a purchase order, you must first define an applicable capitalization policy. For more information on how to define a capitalization policy, see [Define a capitalization policy](define-capitalization-policy.md).

**Note:** Blanket purchase orders cannot result in the creation of a fixed asset.

You can navigate to **Sourcing and Purchasing Automation** &gt; **Primary Data** &gt; **Fixed Assets**, and review these fields.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Number|System-generated unique identifier for the fixed asset.|
|ERP asset number|Unique identifier generated within the ERP system for the fixed asset.|
|Display name|System-generated unique display name for the fixed asset. This is an auto-generated value derived from concatenating the ERP number and the product name into &lt;ERP number - Product name&gt;, where the values are taken from the **ERP asset number** and **Product name** fields respectively. If either of these fields are null or empty, then the corresponding value is left empty.|
|Supplier|Supplier from whom this fixed asset was purchased.|
|Product name|Name of the purchased product.|
|Purchase order line|The purchase associated with this fixed asset.|

|Original value|The amount originally paid for the fixed asset.|
