</table>**Note:** An application-specific admin role enables a user to manage application-level configurations, roles, and access controls. Your system-level admin on the production instance must grant the application-specific admin role to the appropriate users, and then remove the application-specific admin role from all users with the system-level admin role to help prevent system-level admins from viewing sensitive application data via forms, lists, and the UI. For more information, see [Application administration](../../application-development/application-administration.md).
