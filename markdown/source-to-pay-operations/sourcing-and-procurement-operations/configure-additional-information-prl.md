# Configure purchase requisition line-level questions in ShoppingHub

As a procurement administrator, you can create configurable, line-level questions for shoppers to provide the information needed to complete the purchase during the checkout process in Shopping Hub. These questions are defined in Catalog Builder and specific to certain products or product categories.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_shop.procurement\_administrator

## About this task

Plugin required: Shopping Hub \(sn\_spend\_uib\)

Use a record producer to create a custom set of questions to ask shoppers during the quick and full checkout for specific products or product categories. Build this record producer in Catalog Builder using the **ShoppingHub: Additional information on supplier products or product models or product categories** template. For information on how to create a record producer, see [Create a catalog item using a template](../../servicenow-platform/service-catalog/create-item-cat-builder.md).
