# Purchase lines

Purchase lines provide information of the individual lines under a purchase requisition or a sourcing request for the referenced supplier.

A procurement specialist or procurement administrator can manually create a purchase line, in Pending Review state. Populate the following fields on the purchase line:

-   Legal entity and cost center, based on the specified business owner
-   General ledger account fields, based on the ledger assignment rules
-   Starting unit cost and Negotiated unit cost, based on the supplier product's underlying contractual price
-   Unit, based on the underlying product model of the supplier product

If an ineligible supplier product is selected based on existing shopping controls and the “supplier delivers to” criteria, an error is displayed to the shopper when trying to save the purchase line.

A purchase line can also be created from the intake process. It captures the employee request details for the item that needs to be sourced or purchased.

If sourcing is required for the selected supplier product, a sourcing request is created on saving the purchase line. Updating the status of the sourcing request to Closed Canceled or Closed No Decision corresponds to an update in the status of the associated purchase lines. Credit purchases aren’t enabled in this scenario. The grouping logic determines if the line can be automatically merged with an existing purchase requisition.

The key fields of a purchase line are as follows:

Supplier

Supplier for which the shopper places the order.For a non-catalog intake, if the shopper provides a supplier name for which a supplier record doesn’t exist, a new supplier record is manually created with some of these details:

-   Legal name, according to the name provided by the shopper.
-   Onboarding status of the supplier. An onboarding playbook is triggered for new suppliers as part of Supplier Lifecycle Operations, to guide the registration process for the new supplier contact.
-   Relationship status of the supplier
-   Preferred status of the supplier

The contact details provided by the shopper for the supplier is also displayed as a record in the **Vendor Contacts** related list. This record is created with the help of the vendor contact creation API from Supplier Lifecycle Operations.
