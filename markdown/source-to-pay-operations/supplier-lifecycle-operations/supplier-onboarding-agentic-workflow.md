</th><th>

AI agent role

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Supplier data steward AI agent

</td><td>

-   Ensures that the supplier data is accurate, compliant, and continuously maintained across systems. During onboarding, this agent also checks for duplicate supplier records.

**Note:** Duplicate supplier onboarding requests can be resolved from the Now Assist panel by updating the legal name or the email domain of the primary contact's email address.

-   Handles supplier onboarding by creating an invitation case for the supplier contact and assigning the necessary supplier tasks. Additionally, it ensures that the supplier case status is updated appropriately in the system.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Supplier approval AI agent

</td><td>

On approval, confirms supplier activation, activates supplier record and updates supplier company information, sends welcome email to the supplier, notifies the requester on onboarding status, and updates the case status to Closed complete.

 On rejection, provides a reason for rejection, sends an email to the supplier, notifies the requester and supplier about onboarding status, and updates the case to Closed rejected.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Supplier document strategy generator AI agent

</td><td>

-   Generates dynamic onboarding flows that are customized to meet the supplier's compliance and regulatory documentation requirements. Flows are customized based on the following two factors:

    -   The region in which the supplier is based.
    -   The industry in which the supplier operates.
-   Automatically creates tasks for the onboarding flow by referencing all published Knowledge Base \(KB\) articles.

AI suggested similar suppliers

</td><td>

This activity is triggered when an onboarding request originates from a sourcing request. When a shopper selects an external supplier to fulfill a purchase request, an onboarding request is created automatically to onboard the external supplier.The AI suggested similar suppliers activity analyzes the sourcing request and suggests similar suppliers, eliminating the need to onboard a new supplier. You can select either of the following options to proceed:

-   Cancel the current onboarding request by selecting the reject button.
-   Continue with the current onboarding request by selecting the continue button.

</td></tr><tr><td>

AI driven primary data validation

</td><td>

This activity is triggered during the registration stage to validate banking details submitted by the supplier contact. It cross-references the banking details against the information in the attached proof and highlights any discrepancies, enabling the supplier relationship manager to resolve them.A supplier task is first created for the supplier contact to submit banking details through the Supplier Collaboration Portal. Once the supplier contact submits the banking details, the AI driven primary data validation activity is triggered. The supplier relationship manager can then choose to update either the record or the attached proof to resolve the discrepancies.

**Note:** Supplier contacts must select the **Extract values from the attachment to auto-populate form fields.** checkbox while completing the supplier banking information task to auto-populate bank name, account holder name, and account number.
