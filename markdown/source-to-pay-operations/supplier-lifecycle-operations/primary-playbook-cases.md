# Playbook for updating the supplier primary data

Source-to-Pay Workspace includes a playbook that you use for updating the supplier primary data.

## Review supplier primary data request playbook

This playbook provides step-by-step guidance for cases related to updating supplier primary data. The playbook includes a supplier case flow containing various stages and activities that you must complete to close the supplier case. For more information, see [Interact with Playbook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/playbook-ui.md).

This playbook is used for updating the supplier primary data when:

-   A supplier contact submits a request for updating the supplier primary data using the supplier catalog item from the Supplier Collaboration Portal
-   A supplier manager or fulfiller creates a case for updating the supplier primary data from the Source-to-Pay Workspace

The application opens the case on the **Playbook** tab on the Details page.

This playbook is displayed only for these case types:

-   Banking information change request
-   Supplier information change request
-   Supplier location change request
-   Conduct sanction screening
