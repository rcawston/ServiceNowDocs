# Use the supplier onboarding playbook to onboard suppliers

Supplier owners and supplier managers can use the supplier onboarding playbook to complete the tasks and activities that are needed to onboard new suppliers.

## Playbooks overview

Playbooks provide step-by-step guidance for onboarding suppliers. A playbook visualizes a workflow in a simple, task-oriented view. The workflow for a playbook is typically created using [Process Automation Designer](../../build-workflows/workflow-studio/process-automation-designer.md).

A playbook takes a workflow and breaks it into multiple stages. Each stage in a playbook includes one or more activities or steps for a supplier owner or supplier manager to complete. Stages can also include automated activities, such as sending an email to a supplier contact when a stage or activity is complete. For more information, see [Interact with Playbook](../../build-workflows/workflow-studio/playbook-ui.md).

When using a playbook, a supplier owner or supplier manager can:

-   View the playbook stages and activities.
-   View status indicators that display the current state of each activity or step.
-   View check boxes that indicate the stage you are currently at in the workflow.
-   Select an activity and perform the work necessary to complete that activity.
-   Mark an activity as complete and move to the next activity or stage.
-   Complete the stages and activities necessary to complete the case.

## Supplier onboarding playbook

You can use the Supplier onboarding playbook to onboard a new supplier. The Supplier onboarding playbook provides the activities and tasks that a supplier owner or supplier manager can perform during the onboarding process.

You can use the Supplier onboarding playbook with cases that are created using the Onboard a Supplier case type.

The Supplier onboarding playbook appears in the **Playbook** tab on the Case Details page in the Source-to-Pay Workspace.

After you submit a supplier onboarding request, the application creates a new case of type Onboard a Supplier and opens the Case Details page. You can select the **Playbook** tab and start the supplier onboarding process using playbook. For more information on creating a supplier, see [Add a supplier](../sourcing-and-procurement-operations/create-supplier.md).

**Important:** Supplier Lifecycle Operations creates an approval record if the "Ask For Approval" action is a part of any SLO flow. This approval record can be approved by the user who belongs to the Supplier Administrators group \(sys\_user\_group table\). For more information, see [Add a user to a group](../../platform-administration/user-administration/t_AddAUserToAGroup.md).

The Supplier onboarding playbook includes the following stages:

-   Registration: Includes activities to register the supplier.
-   Qualification: Includes activities to verify the eligibility of the supplier.
-   Activation: Includes activities to activate the supplier.
-   Rejection: Includes activities to reject the supplier.
