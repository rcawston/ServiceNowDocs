## Before you begin

Before performing this task, ensure that you do the following:

-   Configure self-registration for external users. For more information, see [Configure self-registration for external users](config-reg-for-external-users-slm.md).

Role required: sn\_slm.owner, sn\_slm.manager, sn\_slm.admin

**Note:** Users with the sn\_slm.owner role can add contacts only for the suppliers that they manage. Users with sn\_slm.manager and sn\_slm.admin roles can add supplier contacts for any supplier.
