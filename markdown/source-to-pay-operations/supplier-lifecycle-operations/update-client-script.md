# Update the field names in the UX client script

Update the field names in the UX client script to match the custom field names in the custom API response.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  In the navigation filter, enter `sys_ux_client_script.list`.

2.  In the UX Client Scripts form, in the **Name** search field, search for the Set 'news' activity state.

3.  Select the **Set 'news activity' section state** client script.

4.  Edit the **Script** field to update the field names so that they match the field names in the custom API response.

    For example, in your custom API response, if the **name** field entry is **title**, and the **description** field entry is **summary**, then you must update the field names accordingly in the script.
