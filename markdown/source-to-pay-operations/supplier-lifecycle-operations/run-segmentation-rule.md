# Run segmentation rule

Run a segmentation rule to create and activate KPIs corresponding to the KPI templates and suppliers in that segment. This action also creates new collection tasks and assigns them to suppliers to collect their KPI data.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_kpi.admin or sn\_slm.manager or sn\_slm.admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Supplier Lifecycle Operations** &gt; **Source-to-Pay Workspace**.

2.  Select the list icon \(![List icon.](../image/cases-list-icon.png)\) and navigate to **Lists** &gt; **Performance management** &gt; **Segmentation rules**.

3.  In the Name column, select the link to the segmentation rule.

4.  Select **Execute**.![Selected Execute button for running a segmentation rule.](../image/run-segmentation-rule.png)


## Result

Running the segmentation rule does the following:

-   Generates KPIs and KPI collection tasks from the KPI templates in the segment if they were never generated before for the newly added suppliers.
-   Sets the KPIs linked to this segment's KPI templates to active and creates new collection tasks for these KPIs.
-   Assigns the new collection tasks to suppliers in this segment.

**Note:** If the number of suppliers to be processed in the segmentation rule is too large, it may lead to a risk of a timeout.
