</td></tr><tr><td>

Active

</td><td>

Option to activate or deactivate the user criteria.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Companies

</td><td>

Companies that the user record must match.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Locations

</td><td>

Locations that the user record must match.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Departments

</td><td>

Departments that the user record must match.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Match All

</td><td>

Option to determine whether all elements from each populated user criteria field must match. If selected, only users who match all user criteria are given access. If cleared, the user must meet one or more of the set user criteria to be given access. By default, this check box is cleared so that any condition met provides a match.

 For example, consider a user criteria record for the following:

-   Locations A or B
-   Company C or D
With **Match All** selected, only users that meet all of these conditions are matched. For example, a user with a location A and a company C.

 If **Match All** isn’t selected, users meeting any of these conditions are matched. For example, a user with a location B.

**Note:** If you select **Match All**, verify that you don't create contradictory conditions that can never be met. For example, if all users in location A work for company G, the conditions in this example can never be met.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>4.  Select **Submit**.
