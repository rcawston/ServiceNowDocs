If you have installed only the Risk Assessments Integration for Supplier Lifecycle Operations \[com.snc.sn\_supplier\_tprm\] plugin, the Perform risk assessment playbook triggers the flow that includes activities to verify the eligibility of the supplier by creating risk assessments.

If you have installed both the Risk Assessments Integration for Supplier Lifecycle Operations \[com.snc.sn\_supplier\_tprm\] and GRC: Third-party Risk Due Diligence \[com.sn\_tprm\_onboarding\] plugins, the Perform risk assessment playbook triggers the flow that includes activities to create a due diligence request, complete Inherent Risk Questionnaire \(IRQ\) assessments, and conduct risk assessments for a third-party and an engagement.
