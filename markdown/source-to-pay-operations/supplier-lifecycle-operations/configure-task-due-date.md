# Configure due dates for tasks

Configure due dates for different task types so that the **Due date** field is auto-populated when you create tasks for internal users and suppliers.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_slm.admin

## About this task

Although the **Due date** field is auto-populated for a task type, you can always update this field as required.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Supplier Lifecycle Operations** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Default Due Dates for Tasks**.

    The Decision Builder opens and displays the Decision table for configuring the default due dates.

    |Task type|Default due date|
    |---------|----------------|
    |Mark complete|3|
    |View link|3|
    |Play video|3|
    |Upload documents|3|
    |Complete a form|3|
    |Sign document|3|
    |Complete checklist|3|
    |Complete survey|3|

2.  Under the Default due date column, select a row next to the task type row and enter a positive number.

    The number that you enter for a task type is auto-populated in the **Due date** field the next time you create a task of that task type.

    For example, let's say that you enter 3 as the due date for the task type Mark complete. If you create a Mark complete task on September 12, the due date will be in three days from this date; that is, September 15.

3.  Select **Save**.


## Result

The default due dates for the different task types are configured.
