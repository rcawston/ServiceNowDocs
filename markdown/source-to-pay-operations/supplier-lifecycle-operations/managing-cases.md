# Manage supplier cases from the Source-to-Pay Workspace

You can create and manage supplier cases for suppliers in the Source-to-Pay Workspace.

On the Source-to-Pay Workspace List page, navigate to **Lists** &gt; **Cases** and select any of the sub-modules to view a list of cases. Select the link to the case in the Number column to open the Case Details page.

For more information about viewing cases in the Source-to-Pay Workspace, see [View a supplier case from the Source-to-Pay Workspace](view-supp-case-ws.md).

The Case Details page contains the following options.

Multi-tab interface

When you select a link for a case, each case opens in a separate tab in the top-left corner, which enables you to easily navigate between multiple open cases. Each case displays information in the following tabs:

-   **Playbook** tab: Displays either the playbook to onboard a supplier or the generic playbook depending on the case type. For more information, see [Use the supplier onboarding playbook to onboard suppliers](use-playbooks-onboard-supp.md#) and [Case playbook for specific supplier case types](gen-playbook-cases.md).
-   **Details** tab: Contains the Supplier Case, Summary Details, and Resolution Information sections.
    -   Supplier Case: Displays information about the supplier case.
    -   Summary Details: Displays the parent case, related location, start and end dates for the case.
    -   Resolution Information: Displays the resolution information and close notes for the case.
-   **Supplier Information** tab: Displays information about the supplier. For more information about this tab, see [View information on supplier cases](supp-info-tab.md).
-   **Supplier Tasks** tab: Lists the supplier tasks for the supplier case.
-   **Related Cases** tab: Lists the child supplier cases related to the parent supplier case.

If you've not installed Third-party Risk Management, the playbook creates supplier cases of types **Risk assessment** and **Tiering assessment**. The Supplier Risk Assessment and Supplier Tiering Assessment cases are child cases of the parent **Onboard a Supplier** case and are displayed on the **Related Cases** tab. The supplier owner or supplier manager assigns these assessment cases to the TPR assessor.

-   **Approvals** tab: Lists the approval records, their approval status, and the persons who need to approve this case.

**Important:** Supplier Lifecycle Operations creates an approval record if the "Ask For Approval" action is a part of any SLO flow. This approval record can be approved by the user who belongs to the Supplier Administrators group \(sys\_user\_group table\). For more information, see [Add a user to a group](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/user-administration/t_AddAUserToAGroup.md).

-   **Risk Assessments** tab: Displays the risk assessments for a supplier.

If you have installed Third-party Risk Management, the playbook creates the risk assessment records and displays them in this tab.

-   **Tiering Assessments** tab: Displays the tiering assessments for a supplier.

If you have installed Third-party Risk Management, the playbook creates the tiering assessment records and displays them in this tab.

**Note:** The **Risk Assessments** and **Tiering Assessments** tabs are shown only for a supplier case of type **Supplier onboarding**.

-   **Draft Emails** tab: Displays a list of emails you saved as draft.
-   **Documents** tab: Enables you to manage supplier documents by uploading, updating and downloading the required documents

    -   **Supplier**: Name of the supplier.
    -   **Short description**: Brief description about the supplier.
    -   **Risk rating**: The risk rating of the supplier.

The risk rating scale helps business users better understand risk assessment results. For example, in the default settings, risk scores in the 20 through 39 range indicate high risk, while scores in the 60 through 79 range indicate low risk.

Depending on the risk score of the supplier, the following risk ratings are displayed:

        -   1 - Very High
        -   2 - High
        -   3 - Moderate
        -   4 - Low

 Select the attachments icon \(![Attachments icon.](../image/attachments-icon.png)\) to open the Attachments panel, which enables you to attach documents to the case.

 Select the agent assist icon \(![Agent Assist icon.](../image/agent-assist-icon.png)\) to open the Agent Assist panel, which enables you to search for information across multiple sources such as catalog items, knowledge articles, supplier cases, problems, and open incidents.
