# Run fix script to update the Aggregation method field in the KPI table

Run this fix script to update the new fields added in the KPI table \(sn\_kpi\_kpi\) after the May 2025 Australia release.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

After the upgrade, the new fields **Aggregation method**, **Collection level**, and **Current threshold value** are added in the KPI table \(sn\_kpi\_kpi\).

It is mandatory to run the script to be able to use new features for the existing KPI records. Without the aggregation method and current threshold values, the calculated KPI behavior and KPI performance calculations might get impacted.

**Note:**

For new KPI templates and KPIs, there’s no impact even if the script is not run.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Definition** &gt; **Fix Scripts**.

2.  Search for the **KPI - May 2025 data upgrade script** script.

3.  Open the fix script record.

    **Note:** In the **Script** field, the batch size variable is set to 9500. If there are more than 9500 KPI records, you can do one of the following:

    -   Run the fix script repeatedly until all active records are checked and copied.
    -   In the **Script** field, set the batch size variable to a number equal to the number of KPI records in your instance and select **Update**.
4.  Select **Run Fix Script**.
