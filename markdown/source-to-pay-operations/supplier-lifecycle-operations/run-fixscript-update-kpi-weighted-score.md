# Run fix script to update the KPI weighted score field in the KPI score table

Run this fix script to update the KPI weighted score field values \(from integer to decimal type\) in the KPI score table \(sn\_kpi\_score\) after the March 2026 Australia release.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

After the upgrade, the old field **Weighted score** is replaced by **KPI weighted score** field in the KPI score \(sn\_kpi\_score\) table.

With the updated decimal type **KPI weighted score** field, all performance scores are calculated in decimal up to three decimal places.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Definition** &gt; **Fix Scripts**.

2.  Search for the **Backfill KPI Weighted Score** script.

3.  Open the fix script record.

    **Note:** In the **Script** field, the batch size variable is set to 10000. If there are more than 10000 KPI records, you can do one of the following:

    -   Run the fix script repeatedly until all active records are checked and copied.
    -   In the **Script** field, set the batch size variable to a number equal to the number of KPI records in your instance and select **Update**.
4.  Select **Run Fix Script**.
