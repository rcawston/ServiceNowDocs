# Emails view for supplier managers

Supplier managers can access all emails including system-triggered emails, inbound replies, and error emails from the Source-to-Pay Workspace at case, task, and supplier levels.

Supplier managers can access all emails linked with a case, task, or supplier from the **Emails** tab in the case, task, and supplier details pages respectively. Email actions are reflected, incomplete email errors are handled, and email-related activities can be summarized from the workspace.

## Email sources

-   System-triggered outbound notification emails \(for task creation\)
-   Inbound replies from supplier contacts \(for example, task completion email\)
-   Inbound replies from internal stakeholders \(for example, task completion email\)
-   Error handling emails

## Email notification to supplier stakeholders for tasks

When a task is created and assigned, the system automatically triggers an notification email to the assigned stakeholder.

-   When the task is assigned to a supplier contact, the email provides the receiver with two options: complete the task directly from the email, or view the task in the Supplier Collaboration Portal.
-   When the task is assigned to an internal stakeholder, the email provides the receiver with two options: complete the task directly from the email, or view the task in the Source-to-Pay Workspace.

**Note:** If the email subject or reference ID is modified while marking the task as complete via email, the system detects the mismatch and sends an automated error notification emails.

## Email summarization for tasks and cases

An AI summary of all emails linked to a task or case can be generated using the **Summarize** button on the **Emails** page.

The following sections are displayed:

-   **Summary**: Includes number of emails, key theme, tone, and actions required.
-   **Next steps**: Includes list of tasks, outstanding questions or escalations, and further updates.

To enable email summarization, set the default model for the One Extend capabilities.

1.  Navigate to **Sys\_One\_Extend\_Capability**.
2.  Open the **Summarize** record.
3.  In the **OneExtend Definition Configs** related list, verify that at least one model is marked as **Default** to **True**.

**Note:** Email summarization is not available for supplier records.
