# Enable M2M mapping between supplier contact and suppliers

Many-to-many \(M2M\) mapping between supplier contact and suppliers enables one supplier contact to be the contact for multiple suppliers, provided the suppliers share a parent-subsidiary relationship.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

**Important:** M2M mapping between supplier contact and suppliers is available from the Xanadu December 2024 release onwards. The following steps are required to enable M2M mapping.

## Procedure

1.  Create and run a fix script to enable M2M mapping.

    For detailed steps, see [Run the fix script to enable M2M mapping](run-fix-script.md).

2.  Verify that the version record is created for the script `include M2MSupplierSupportUtil`.

    For detailed steps, see [Verify version record](verify-version-record.md).

3.  Configure the Supplier Email Domain \[sn\_slm\_email\_domain\] table to remove the `unique` constraint from the `Email Domains` column.

    For detailed steps, see [Remove the unique constraint from Email Domain](remove-unique-constraint.md).

    **Note:** This step is required only for the upgrade scenarios \(for all earlier versions upgrading to the Xanadu December 2024 release\).
