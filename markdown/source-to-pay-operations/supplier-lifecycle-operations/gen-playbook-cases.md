# Case playbook for specific supplier case types

Source-to-Pay Workspace includes a generic case playbook to complete supplier cases of specific case types.

## Case playbook for supplier cases

The case playbook provides step-by-step guidance for completing specific types of supplier cases. The case playbook includes a generic supplier case flow containing various stages and activities that you must complete to close the supplier case. For more information, see [Interact with Playbook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/playbook-ui.md).

When a supplier contact submits a request using the supplier catalog item from the Supplier Collaboration Portal or when a supplier manager or fulfiller creates a case from the Source-to-Pay Workspace, the application opens the case on the **Playbook** tab on the Details page.

The case playbook is displayed only for these case types:

-   Supplier issue
-   Supplier support request
-   General inquiry

## Case playbook flow

The following diagram illustrates the flow of the activities in each stage of the Case playbook.
