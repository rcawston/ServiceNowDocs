# Supplier Document Management

Supplier Lifecycle Operations uses the ServiceNow® Document Management functionality to enable supplier managers, supplier owners, supplier administrators, and supplier contacts to manage supplier documents.

**Important:** Check your entitlements to determine whether you have access to Document Management.

Supplier Lifecycle Operations extends the Document Management plugin \(com.snc.platform\_document\_management\), which is installed along with the Supplier Operations \(com.snc.sn\_so\) application. For more information, see [Document Management](../../servicenow-platform/document-management-services/doc-management-landing.md).

You can create a supplier document configuration to configure various aspects of the document upload process. The document configuration determines when this configuration is run, who can view, update, and upload a document, and whether to send notifications when a document is uploaded or has expired. You can set run conditions to determine when the configuration should be run or you can run the configuration manually.
