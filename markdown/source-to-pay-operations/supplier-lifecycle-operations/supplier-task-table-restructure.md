# Restructured Supplier Task table

The Supplier Task table architecture has been restructured in the Washington DC and Yokohama releases.

In releases before the Washington DC release, the Supplier Task \[sn\_slm\_task\] table extended the Task \[task\] table.

Starting with the Washington DC release, the Supplier Task \[sn\_slm\_task\] table extends the Service Task \[sn\_spend\_sdc\_service\_task\] table.
