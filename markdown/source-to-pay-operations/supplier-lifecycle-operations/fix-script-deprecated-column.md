# Run fix script to migrate existing data from the deprecated Action type column after upgrade

In the May Store 2024 release, the **Action type** column in the Supplier Task \(sn\_slm\_task\) table has been deprecated.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

In the May Store 2024 release, the Supplier Task \(sn\_slm\_task\) table uses the **Action type for task** column from its parent Service Task \[sn\_spend\_sdc\_service\_task\] table. After you upgrade to the May Store 2024 release, ensure that you run the fix script to migrate existing data from the deprecated **Action type** column to the newly added **Action type for task** column in the Supplier Task table.

**Important:** Before you run the fix script, ensure that you restructure the Supplier Task table to extend the Service Task table.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Definition** &gt; **Fix Scripts**.

2.  Search for the **SLO - upgrade scripts for may 2024** script.

3.  Open the fix script record.

4.  In the **Script** field, set the batch size variable to a number equal to the number of supplier task records in your instance.

    For example, if your instance has 10000 supplier task records, set the batch size variable as follows:

    `var batchSize = 10000;`

5.  Select **Update**.

6.  Select **Run Fix Script**.
