# Create KPI thresholds

Create KPI thresholds that consist of predefined values that serve as benchmarks or limits for evaluating performance against specific objectives.

Create KPI thresholds. 

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_slm.manager or sn\_slm.admin

## About this task

Ensure that you add at least two active thresholds to activate a KPI template. You can add a maximum of five thresholds to a KPI template.

**Note:** Thresholds help determine what score the supplier receives in the **KPI management** tab and in the scorecard. For more information, see [Manage supplier KPIs from the supplier record page of the Source-to-Pay Workspace](kpi-mgmt-tab-supplier.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Supplier Lifecycle Operations** &gt; **Source-to-Pay Workspace**.

2.  Select the list icon \(![List icon.](../image/cases-list-icon.png)\), and navigate to **Lists** &gt; **Performance management** &gt; **KPI Templates**.

3.  In the Name column, select the link to the KPI template.

4.  Select the **Thresholds** tab and select **New**.

5.  On the form, fill in the fields.
