</table>9.  Navigate to **Action plan items** and select **Create**.

10. Create milestones or supplier tasks for each KPI to track the action plan.

    For more information on how to create milestones and supplier tasks, see [Create milestones for the action plan](create-milestones-for-the-action-plan.md) and [Create supplier tasks for the action plan](create-supplier-tasks-for-the-action-plan.md).

11. Select **Submit** to activate the action plan.

    The corresponding milestones and tasks are generated for the action plan.

    Internal users can add comments through the **Work notes** and the progress of the action plan can be tracked in the **Activity** stream section.

## Result

After the milestones are run, corresponding tasks are generated for the users assigned to those milestones. When they complete their tasks, performance metrics are recalculated to determine whether the KPIs are still on target or failing. If a KPI is linked to a milestone or an action plan, the dashboard highlights its status:

-   On Target – if the KPI is meeting or exceeding the target
-   Failing - if the KPI is not meeting its current target
-   Failing in a plan - if the KPI is in an action plan and isn’t meeting its milestone targets
-   Part of a Plan - if the KPI is in a plan and progressing but not failing

Emails are sent to the assignees when action plans are created. Emails are also sent in the following scenarios:

-   When there’s any change in the action plan
-   When an action plan fails \(tasks or milestones aren’t completed after the due date\)
-   When an action plan expires
-   When an action plan is completed

The action plan can be tracked continuously, with updates based on the subsequent KPI runs. Managers can monitor the progress of milestones and tasks using the Gantt chart.

The following color code is followed to represent different tasks in the Gantt chart:

-   Teal: Active tasks within due date
-   Blue: Active tasks past due date and completed
-   Orange: Active tasks past due date but not completed
