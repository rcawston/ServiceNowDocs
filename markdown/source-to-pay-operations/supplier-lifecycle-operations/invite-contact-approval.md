# Configure the flow to create approval records for all supplier contact invite requests

## Before you begin

## About this task

After you perform this task, an approval record is created for the Enroll a new supplier user case type, regardless of whether a supplier contact self-registers or a supplier manager invites a new supplier contact.

This approval record can be approved by the user who belongs to the Supplier Administrators group \(sys\_user\_group table\). For more information, see [Add a user to a group](../../platform-administration/user-administration/t_AddAUserToAGroup.md).
