# Tax integration in playbook

The Accounts Payable Operations playbook enables AP specialists and tax specialists to perform invoice tax validation using tax engine integration. Use the playbook for implementing and viewing the different stages of tax validation using the tax engine integration.

## Before you begin

Role required: AP specialist, tax specialist

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Source-to-Pay Workspace**.

2.  Select the list icon \(![List icon](../../supplier-lifecycle-operations/image/cases-list-icon.png)\).

    A list of options within the workspace is displayed.

3.  Select **Invoices &gt;****All invoices.**

    You can create an invoice manually. For more information on invoices, see [Work with invoices](work-with-invoices.md). Invoices can be entered manually or extracted using DocIntel. For more information on invoice extraction, see [Configure data extraction modes](set-up-extraction-modes-di.md).

4.  Select **View Invoice processing case**.

5.  Select **Validate invoice**.

    1.  Select the **Review header** details.

        Review the invoice header details and make any required changes. Tax mentioned in the invoice copy is entered or extracted as supplier tax \(editable\) at header level and the system tax is the sum total of system tax \(read only, derived from external tax engine\) for all the tax lines.

    2.  Select **Save**.

    3.  Select **Continue** to move to the next activity in the playbook.

    4.  Select the **Review invoice lines** activity and manually review the invoice lines associated with the invoice.

        **Note:** When tax integration is disabled, you can create tax lines from related list of invoice lines or invoice case. For more information on tax lines in related list see [Using Playbook in Accounts Payable Operations](how-to-use-playbook.md). If tax integration is enabled, you can add tax lines using the related list but the tax lines are deleted and new tax lines are added as a response from external tax engine. Tax mentioned for each invoice line in the invoice copy is entered or extracted as supplier tax \(editable\) at invoice line level and the system tax \(read only, derived from external tax engine\) is the sum total of system tax \(read only\) for all the tax lines of that particular invoice line.

    5.  Select **Add new invoice lines** to create invoice lines.

    6.  Select **Continue** to move to the next activity in the playbook.

    7.  Select **Submit invoice**.

        **Note:** During invoice processing \(straight-through processing\), when the invoice is sent to tax engine for validation, you can view the progress in the **Review compliance** swim lane. You will be prompted with a message "No action is needed. The system automatically runs a tax validation using a third-party tax engine. This verifies tax details from the invoice and ensures compliance by validating tax rates and jurisdictions. After tax validation is complete, the system moves to the next step automatically.![Tax validation in progress](../image/tax-validation-in-progress.png)

</td></tr><tr><td>

Under tax amount variance \(invoice header\) exception

</td><td>

Total tax amount on the invoice header is lesser than the total tax \(considering the variance\) for the invoice received through tax engine
