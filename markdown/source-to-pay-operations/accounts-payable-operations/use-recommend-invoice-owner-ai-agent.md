# Use Recommend invoice owner AI agent

Use the Recommend invoice owner AI agent to detect business owners for Non-PO invoices and Non-PO credit memos that lack an owner. The AI agent analyzes historically processed invoices to recommend the most likely business owner, which an accounts payable specialist can review, approve, or override.

## Before you begin

Role required: Accounts Payable specialist \(sn\_ap\_apm.accounts\_payable\_specialist\)

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Accounts Payable Operations** &gt; **Accounts Payable Workspace**.

2.  Select the list icon ![](../../supplier-lifecycle-operations/image/cases-list-icon.png).

3.  Select **My work** &gt; **Invoice exceptions**.

4.  From the **Number** column, select the link for the 'Missing or invalid business owner' exception with the status **Review needed**.

    The missing or invalid business owner exception opens. A message that Now Assist has a resolution plan to solve the exception displays.

5.  Select **View plan**.![View resolution plan](../image/apo-view-resolution-plan.png)

    The AI agent summarizes the exception and provides a resolution plan. For more details on the resolution plan, see [Resolution plan scenarios](resolution-plan-scenarios.md).

6.  Review and confirm the resolution plan.![Confirm recommendation](../image/apo-confirm-resolution-plan.png)

    In this scenario, a business owner is assigned. ![Review and confirm the resolution plan](../image/apo-resolution-plan.png)


## Result

When a business owner is found, the AI agent updates the **Business owner** field on the invoice based on the closest matching invoice, updates the activity, and changes the exception status to **Review complete**.

If no business owner is found, the AI agent suggests creating a task.
