# Invoice processing cases

Typically, Accounts Payable Operations integration with Document Intelligence automatically creates the invoice processing case by extracting data from the invoice that you receive as an attachment via email. However, the Accounts Payable Specialist may need to manually create a new invoice or update details of a partially created invoice in situations where the automated invoice creation process encounters issues or is not available.

By default, when an inbound email is received in Accounts Payable Operations integration with Document Intelligence, the invoice processing flow is triggered and an invoice case with a category of **Invoice automation** and sub-category of **Invoice processing** is created. For more information, see [Install Accounts Payable Operations integration with Document Intelligence](apm-integration-docintel.md).

## Invoice processing case life cycle

The following figure illustrates the various states that the Invoice processing case goes through during its life cycle, from its creation to closure.

|State|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|New|The case is created.|
|Assigned|The case is assigned.|
|Work in progress|The case is being worked on.|
|Closed complete|The case moves to this state after the invoice approval request is approved by the approver or after the invoice is auto-approved by the approval engine.|
|Closed incomplete|The case moves to this state when the invoice is in the Suspected duplicate state and the Accounts Payable Specialist selects the **Confirm duplicate** option.|
|Canceled|The case is canceled because it was created in error or is no longer required.|
