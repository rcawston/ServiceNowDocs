# Configuring invoice owner prediction settings

The Recommend invoice owner AI agent uses a set of configurable system properties. These properties define the logic to identify and assign business owners for Non-PO invoices and Non-PO credit memos.

Navigate to **All** &gt; **Accounts Payable Operations** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Properties** to access the invoice owner prediction settings. These settings influence the number of historical invoices analyzed, the time considered, and the confidence threshold used to make recommendations. The AP admin can modify these settings. For more information on the settings, see [Set APO properties](set-apo-properties.md).
