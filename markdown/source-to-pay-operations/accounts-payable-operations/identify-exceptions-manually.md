# Check for invoice exceptions on a single invoice

Manually check for invoice exceptions on a single invoice so that you can resolve them.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ap\_apm.accounts\_payable\_specialist or sn\_ap\_apm.admin

## About this task

The **Check exceptions** option is available for all invoices that are in **Exceptions found** state.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Accounts Payable Operations** &gt; **Accounts Payable Workspace**.

2.  Select the list icon \(![List icon](../../supplier-lifecycle-operations/image/cases-list-icon.png)\).

3.  Navigate to **Lists** &gt; **Primary Data** &gt; **Invoices**.

4.  Open an invoice that is in the **Exceptions found** state.

5.  Select **View invoice processing case**.

    **Note:** If you open an invoice processing case for an invoice that is in Exceptions found status, the invoice processing case form displays the following notification at the top:

    `Invoice has one or more exceptions. Resolve all issues in "Invoice exceptions" to continue processing.`

6.  On the invoice processing case form, select **Check exceptions**.

7.  Select **Yes**.

    While exceptions are being identified on the invoice, the status of the invoice changes to **Checking exceptions** for a short period of time and the following occurs:

    -   If no exceptions are found on the invoice, the status of the invoice changes to No exceptions found.
    -   If exceptions are found on the invoice, the status of the invoice remains as Exceptions found.
