# Invoice exceptions

Invoice exceptions are issues that are identified in an invoice during invoice processing.

The Accounts Payable Operations exception engine automatically identifies discrepancies in invoices and lists them as invoice exceptions in the Source-to-Pay Workspace workspace. The Accounts Payable Specialist can analyze the identified invoice exceptions and take appropriate action to resolve them.

The Accounts Payable Operations exception engine is run for the PO invoices that are in either the PO matching completed or Exceptions found state.

The Accounts Payable Operations exception engine is run for Non-PO invoices that are in the Accepted or Exceptions found state.

The Accounts Payable Operations exception engine identifies invoice exceptions of the following types.

If Sourcing and Procurement Operations \(PSM\) is installed, and if no receipt task exists for the purchase order line, Accounts Payable Invoice Processing creates a receipt task and displays the task in the **Related tasks** tab of the exception form. For more information, see [Invoice exception form](exception-form-fields.md).

The receipt task is assigned to the user specified in the **Recipient** field on the PO line. The recipient must have the sn\_shop.acknowledgement\_task\_owner role to complete the receipt task from Employee Center.

For more information, see [Confirm receipt of your order from Employee Center](confirm-receipt-task.md).

If Sourcing and Procurement Operations isn’t installed, then the Accounts Payable Specialist must manually create an exception task, which is assigned to the business owner. The business owner must mark this task as complete in Employee Center. For more information, see [Mark an exception task as complete from Employee Center](complete-exception-task-ec.md).

</table>By default, the exception engine is configured to run once every 5 minutes through the **Exception Monitoring Job**. This is a scheduled job, which is inactive in the state by default. For information on how to activate the scheduled job, see [Activate the Exceptions Monitoring Scheduler](activate-exception-flow.md).

However, you can also run the exception engine manually. For more information, see [Check for invoice exceptions on a single invoice](identify-exceptions-manually.md).

When you run the exception engine manually on a single invoice, it checks for exceptions only on that invoice, whereas the automated exception engine checks for exceptions on all the invoices that are valid for exception check.

You can bypass an exception in situations where that exception is not applicable to an invoice. For more information, see [Bypass an invoice exception](bypass-invoice-exception.md).

The Accounts Payable Operations exception engine finds exceptions and lists them in the list page of the Source-to-Pay Workspace. View the list of exceptions by navigating to **All** &gt; **Accounts Payable Operations** &gt; **Accounts Payable Workspace**.

In the workspace, select the list icon \(![List icon](../../supplier-lifecycle-operations/image/cases-list-icon.png)\) and do one of the following:

-   Navigate to **Lists** &gt; **My Work** &gt; **My open invoice exceptions**.
-   Navigate to **Lists** &gt; **All Work** &gt; **All open invoice exceptions**.

The Accounts Payable Specialist can analyze the invoice exceptions, create exception tasks, and assign these tasks to the relevant individuals to fix the exceptions and resolve the case. For more information, see [Work on an invoice exception](work-invoice-exception-case.md).
