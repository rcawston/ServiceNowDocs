# Create a copy of the default Invoice Processing use case

Create a copy of the default invoice processing use case to customize the invoice flow in your environment.

## Before you begin

Ensure that the application scope is set to Accounts Payable Operations integration with Document Intelligence.

Role required: admin

## About this task

Do this task to copy the default **DO NOT USE- Invoice Processing V3** use case along with its fields, field groups, integrations, flows, and all the related machine learning \(ML\) models.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **All** &gt; **Document Intelligence** &gt; **Document Data Extraction Administration** &gt; **Use cases**.

2.  Open the **DO NOT USE- Invoice Processing V3** use case.

3.  Select **Duplicate use case** icon \(![Duplicate use case](../image/duplicate-di-usecase.png)\).

    You will be prompted with a message `"Choose the name for this use case"`.

4.  Click **Duplicate** button

    -   The copy is saved automatically into your environment.
    -   A copy of the DO NOT USE - Invoice Processing V3 use case is created with the name entered. You can see the copied use case by navigating to **All** &gt; **Document Intelligence** &gt; **Use Cases**. For more information on configuring use case, see [Configuring Document Intelligence](../../intelligent-experiences/document-intelligence/doc-intel-administration.md).
    -   A flow named DocIntel Extract Values Flow is created. This flow is suffixed with the name of the copied use case that was created after you clicked the copy \(![duplicate di case](../image/duplicate-di-usecase.png)\) icon. For example, DocIntel Extract Values Flow - name of the entered use case - Invoice Processing v2. You can see this flow by navigating to **All** &gt; **Process Automation** &gt; **Flow Designer** and searching for the flow name.

        You must add the missing information in the newly created flow by copying the existing information from the default DocIntel Extract Values Flow - Invoice Processing v2.0. For more information, see [Configure the newly created DocIntel Extract Values Flow](configure-extract-values-flow.md).


## Result

Copy of the default invoice processing use case is created.
