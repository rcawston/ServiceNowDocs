# Invoice inquiry cases

Invoice inquiry cases help you resolve invoice-related issues raised by the suppliers or employees.

When you receive an email for an inquiry, the application automatically creates an invoice case with a category of **Inquiry** and one of the following sub-categories:

-   **Payment inquiry**
-   **Invoice inquiry**
-   **Expedite payment request**
-   **Payment terms issue**
-   **Invoice entry assistance**
-   **Other**

**Note:** An invoice case with a category of **Inquiry** is referred to as an invoice inquiry case.

However, an agent \[sn\_ap\_cm.agent\] can manually create invoice inquiry cases and work on them or create Accounts Payable tasks for those cases and assign them to a user or group. For more information, see [Create an invoice inquiry case manually](create-inquiry-case.md).
