# Create an invoice manually

As an Accounts Payable Specialist, you can create an invoice manually from the Source-to-Pay Workspace when the automated invoice creation process is encountering issues or not available.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ap\_apm.accounts\_payable\_specialist or sn\_ap\_apm.admin

## About this task

Invoices are created automatically by integration with Document Intelligence. However, you can also create invoices manually.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **All** &gt; **Accounts Payable Operations** &gt; **Source-to-Pay Workspace**.

2.  Under Quick actions, select **Create New Invoice**.![Create invoice manually](../image/create-invoice-manually.png)

3.  On the Create New Invoice form, fill in the fields.

    For a description of the field values, see [Create New Invoice form](create-new-invoice-form.md).

4.  Select **Save**.

    A new invoice is created in the Draft state, a new invoice case is created with a category of Invoice automation and sub-category of Invoice processing, and the new invoice is associated with the invoice case.

    For more information about working with an invoice processing case, see [Work on an invoice processing case](work-manual-invoice-ingestion-case.md).


## What to do next

Create invoice lines for the invoice. For more information, see [Create an invoice line manually](create-invoice-line.md).
