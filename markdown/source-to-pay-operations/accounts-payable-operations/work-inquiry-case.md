# Work on an invoice inquiry case

## About this task

An invoice case with a category of Inquiry is referred to as an invoice inquiry case.

Typically, an invoice inquiry case is automatically created when you receive an inquiry email. However, the agent can also manually create an invoice inquiry case from the Source-to-Pay Workspace. For more information, see [Create an invoice inquiry case manually](create-inquiry-case.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Accounts Payable Operations** &gt; **Accounts Payable Workspace**.

2.  Select the list icon \(![List icon](../../supplier-lifecycle-operations/image/cases-list-icon.png)\).

3.  Do one of the following:

    -   Navigate to **Lists** &gt; **My Work** &gt; **Open cases**.
    -   Navigate to **Lists** &gt; **All Work** &gt; **Cases**.

    -   To assign the case to yourself, select **Assign to me**.

6.  Do one of the following:

    -   Request more information about the invoice inquiry case from the requester. For more information, see [Request additional information from the requester for an invoice inquiry case](request-caller-info-inquiry-case.md).

        The state of the case updates to Awaiting requester info.

    -   Submit the invoice inquiry case for an internal review. For more information, see [Submit an invoice inquiry case for an internal review](submit-inquiry-case-internal-review.md).

        The state of the case updates to Awaiting internal info.

    -   Create an invoice task and assign it to a user or group to resolve the invoice inquiry case. For more information, see [Create an invoice task](create-apm-task.md).
    -   The state of an inquiry case changes from Awaiting requester info and Awaiting internal info to Work in progress in the following scenarios:
        -   An email reply from a requester triggers an action to move the inquiry case state to Work in progress.
        -   When all inquiry tasks are closed, the inquiry case state is automatically changed to Work in progress.
        -   An agent can manually change the inquiry state from Awaiting requester info to Work in progress.
7.  Close an invoice inquiry case when all the activities and tasks for resolving the case are completed.

    For more information, see [Close an invoice inquiry case](close-inquiry-case.md).

    The inquiry case and related tasks are closed successfully.
