# ERP source configuration for SAP Ariba

Configure your Source-to-Pay \(S2P\) instance to support inbound and outbound integration with your ERP system. This integration configuration enables you to post purchase order, receipt, invoice, and download primary data automatically from the ERP system.

ERP source configuration enables the implementation of specific logic to populate values pertinent to third-party ERP systems. It includes all service mappings defined between Source-to-Pay \(S2P\) and the third-party ERP system. If multiple ERP sources exist, they’re stored as distinct ERP source entries with their corresponding service mappings.

To meet specific requirements, you can customize the service-mapping logic by modifying the relevant service element map entry within the service map record. For organizations using multiple ERP systems, an ERP Source field has been incorporated into the tables to accurately identify the respective integrated ERP system.

The ERP source configuration for SAP Ariba enables customers to establish multiple SAP Ariba instances. Each instance is identified by a distinct source, and the connection alias for each instance must be unique.

## Prerequisites

Before you start the integration configuration, complete the following tasks.

-   Add the following roles to the Integration user:
    -   sn\_fcms\_intg.admin
    -   sn\_spend\_intg.admin
-   Get the following details from the ERP team:
    -   ERP integration user credentials.
    -   REST API details based on your ERP system you're using for the integration.

**Note:** If the application must support multiple ERP instances, configure Source-to-Pay to integrate with each ERP instance separately.
