# Look up primary data in SAP Ariba

You can run a job to look up primary data from different ERP sources into ServiceNow.

Before the ERP integration, configure the integration services record for the target ERP source using the `sn_fcms_intg_service` table. The `sn_fcms_intg_service` table is a mapping table between the subflows and targets the ERP source. For more information on creating an integration service record, see [Create Integration Service record](create-integration-service-record.md).
