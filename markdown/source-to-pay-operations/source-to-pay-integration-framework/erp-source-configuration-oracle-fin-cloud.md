# ERP source configuration for Oracle Financial Cloud

Configure your Source-to-Pay \(S2P\) instance to support inbound and outbound integration with your ERP system. This integration configuration enables you to automatically post purchase order, receipt, invoice, and download primary data from the ERP.

ERP source configuration enables the implementation of specific logic to populate values pertinent to third-party ERP systems. It includes all service mappings defined between Source-to-Pay \(S2P\) and the third-party ERP system. In cases where multiple ERP sources exist, they’re stored as distinct ERP source entries with their corresponding service mappings.

To meet specific requirements, you can modify the service-mapping logic by updating the relevant service element map entry within the service map record. For organizations using multiple ERP systems, an ERP Source field has been incorporated into the tables to ensure accurate identification of the respective integrated ERP system.

The ERP source configuration for Oracle Financial Cloud enables customers to establish multiple Oracle instances. Each instance is identified by a distinct source, and the connection alias for each instance must be unique.

## Prerequisites

Before you start the integration configuration, you must complete the following tasks.

-   Add the following roles to the Integration user:
    -   Import\_transformer
    -   SOAP
-   Get the following details from the ERP team:
    -   ERP integration user credentials.
    -   SOAP or REST API details based on your ERP system and the type of web services you’re using for the integration.

**Note:** If the application must support multiple ERP instances, configure Source-to-Pay to integrate with each ERP instance separately.

## ERP Source Configuration

To perform the ERP Source configuration for Oracle Financial Cloud, follow these steps:

1.  Define the ERP source that you want to integrate with Oracle Financial Cloud integration.
2.  Create a basic authentication profile that can be used for web service integration with Oracle Financial Cloud.
3.  Register the Oracle Financial Cloud integration username and password to create the authentication profile and associate it to service maps.
4.  Define source configuration for ERP source. The ERP source configuration determines the ERP source to which your ERP system connects. For more information, see [Define ERP source configuration for Oracle Financial Cloud](define-erp-source-config-oracle-fin-cloud.md).
5.  Configure service maps for the following entities:

    -   **Suppliers**

        Set up subflows for the source configuration to lookup suppliers from Oracle Financial Cloud.

    -   **Payment Terms**

        Set up subflows for the source configuration to lookup payment terms from Oracle Financial Cloud.

    -   **Legal Entities**

        Set up subflows for the source configuration to lookup legal entities or company code details from Oracle Financial Cloud.

    -   **Currencies**

        Set up subflows for the source configuration to lookup currencies from Oracle Financial Cloud.

    -   **GL Accounts**

        Set up subflows for the source configuration to lookup GL accounts from Oracle Financial Cloud.

    -   **Purchase Groups**

        Set up subflows for the source configuration to lookup purchase groups from Oracle Financial Cloud.

    -   **Purchasing Orgs**

        Set up subflows for the source configuration to lookup purchasing orgs from Oracle Financial Cloud.

    -   **Cost Center**

        Set up subflows for the source configuration to lookup purchasing cost center from Oracle Financial Cloud.

6.  Configure a scheduled job to synchronize primary data updates from Oracle Financial Cloud.
7.  Set up the interval in the lookup Cost Center scheduled job to periodically synchronize primary data updates from the ERP, for posting services to work.

    **Note:** Similarly, you can configure schedule jobs for the other integrations services.

8.  Load data to the Oracle Financial Cloud user-mapping table.
9.  Set up Source-to-Pay and ERP User ID mapping `(sn_fcms_intg_erp_user_map)` for the integration to work.

    The mapping is maintained for all active users who have the procurement buyer role in ERP. These users should be used in the requisition assignment rule.

    You have configured the ERP source for Oracle Financial Cloud.
