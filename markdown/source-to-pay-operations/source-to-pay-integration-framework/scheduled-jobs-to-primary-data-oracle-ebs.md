# Scheduled jobs to look up primary data in Oracle EBS

You can schedule on-demand jobs to be run at specific intervals of time to fetch primary data from different Oracle EBS ERP sources into ServiceNow.

Before you start the Oracle EBS ERP integration, you must configure the integration services record for target ERP source using the `sn_fcms_intg_service` table. The `sn_fcms_intg_service` table is a mapping table between sub flows and target ERP source. For more information on creating an integration service record, see [Create Integration Service record](create-integration-service-record.md).

Scheduled jobs are configured for entities using scripts. Example: Fetch cost center from ERP systems. For more information on configuring scheduled jobs using scripts, see [Automatically run a script of your choosing](../../platform-administration/time-configuration/t_ScheduleAScriptExecution.md). The script invokes a subflow, which is associated with an entity as shown in the following figure. The subflow queries the active entities or ERP source configuration \(optional\) listed in the integration service table.
