4.  Select **More actions**, and select **Copy flow**.

    **Important:** Perform this step only if you plan to customize or make specific changes to the flow.

    1.  In the Create a copy of this flow dialog, provide a name for the new flow.

        The Application is SAP Ariba Spoke, by default.

5.  Activate the flow or subflow.

    -   Make sure that the flow or subflow is available and activated in the base system.
    -   Activate the copied flow after making the required changes.

    **Note:**

    Once data is pulled into staging tables, transform maps move data into target tables. For more details, refer to [Source-to-Pay integration framework transform maps and subflows](s2p-transform-maps-flows.md).

    You have successfully copied and executed the flow.
