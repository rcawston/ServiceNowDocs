## Before you begin

-   Verify that the application scope is set to Coupa spoke.
-   Verify that the MID Server is installed and configured in your ServiceNow instance to connect to the ERP server. For more details, see [Installing the MID Server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/mid-server/mid-server-installation.md).

## About this task

If the application requires multiple Coupa ERP instances, create separate web services for each ERP instance. You can create Integration Service records for entities using the `sn_fcms_intg_service` table.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Finance – ERP Integration** &gt; **ERP Source Configuration**.

2.  Open the ERP source for which you need to configure Integration services.

    For example, Coupa.

3.  In the Integration Services list, select the service that you want to configure.

    ![Look up Legal Entities from Coupa](../../source-to-pay-operations/image/coupa-fulllpull.png "Look up Legal Entities from Coupa")

4.  On the integration service record, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_ygn_3bx_y2c"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Entity

</td><td>

Type of entity for which you want to configure the integration service.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Application

</td><td>

Name of the application. For example, Coupa.

</td></tr><tr><td>

ERP Source configuration

</td><td>

The ERP source mapped to the entity. For example, Coupa.

</td></tr><tr><td>

</td></tr><tr><td>

Properties

</td><td>

Properties of the service.

 The property creates a JSON record in the integration service, which is then passed to the ERP subflows to retrieve complete data.

 To pass JSON into the subflow, create a property named "query" and assign it a JSON query as its value, like this:

```
[
  {
    "parameter": "LEGAL_ENTITY_NAME",
    "operator": "=",
    "value": "Vision ADB",
    "operand": "NONE"
  }
]
```

 -   **Enabling Full Pull**:

Create a property named "`full_pull`" and set its value to `true`

-   **Enabling Delta Pull**:

Use this property to fetch the incremental data.

Set the value of the "`full_pull`" property to `false`.
