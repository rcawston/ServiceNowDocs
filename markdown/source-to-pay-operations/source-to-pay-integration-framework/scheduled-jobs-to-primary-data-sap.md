# Scheduled jobs to look up primary data in SAP

You can schedule on-demand jobs to be run at specific intervals of time to fetch primary data from different SAP ERP sources into ServiceNow.

Before you start the SAP ERP integration, you must configure the integration services record for target ERP source using the `sn_fcms_intg_service` table. The `sn_fcms_intg_service` table is a mapping table between sub flows and target ERP source. For more information on creating a integration service record, see [Configure integration services for SAP](configure-service-maps-sap.md).
