# Configure integration services for SAP

For configuring integration services, provide the connection end point and the SAP ERP credentials that you set up for your authentication profile. Also, create a separate integration service record for each service request that you want to customize.

Configure integration services for SAP 

## Before you begin

-   Verify that the application scope is set to SAP ECC and SAP S4 HANA spoke.
-   Verify that the MID Server is installed and configured in your ServiceNow instance to connect to the ERP server. For more details, see [Installing the MID Server](../../servicenow-platform/mid-server/mid-server-installation.md).
-   For REST type service, REST API details, as provided by ERP.

Role required: sn\_fcms\_intg.admin

## About this task

If the application requires multiple SAP instances, create separate integration services for each ERP instance. You can create integration service records for entities using the `sn_fcms_intg_service` table.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Finance – ERP Integration** &gt; **ERP Source Configuration**.

2.  Open the ERP source for which you need to configure integration services.

    For example, SAP ECC or SAP S4 HANA.

3.  In the Integration Services list, select the service that you want to configure.

    ![Look up Legal Entities from SAP S4 HANA OData](../../source-to-pay-operations/image/sap-integration-full-pull.png "Look up Legal Entities from SAP S4 HANA OData")

4.  To modify the Integration service record, select **here**.

5.  On the Integration service record, fill in the fields.
