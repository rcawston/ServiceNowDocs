# Use schedule flows in Oracle EBS

Use the schedule flows to retrieve information from Oracle EBS, including invoices, cost centers, product models, payment terms, purchasing organizations, departments, GL accounts, currencies, FX rates, invoice payment details, suppliers, plant addresses, and legal entities.

You can either use the subflows to perform the required tasks or you can create a copy of the subflows and then customize it according to your requirements.

**Important:**

These subflows are read-only. To modify a flow or subflow, create a copy and then apply the required changes.

The Source-to-Pay with Oracle EBS integration supports the following subflows.
