# Configure integration services for SAP Ariba

For configuring integration services, provide the connection end point and the SAP Ariba credentials that you set up for your authentication profile. Also, create a integration service record for each entity you want to customize.

## Before you begin

2.  Open the ERP source for which you must configure integration services.

    For example, select SAP Ariba REST.

3.  In the Integration Services list, select the service that you want to configure.

    For example, select **Invoices**.

4.  To edit the ERP source, select **here** from the label **To edit this record click here**.

5.  On the integration service record, update the fields to modify the configurations.
