# Configure integration services for Oracle Financial Cloud

For configuring integration services, provide the connection end point and the Oracle Financial Cloud ERP credentials that you set up for your authentication profile. Also, create a separate web service record for each service request that you want to customize.

## Before you begin

-   Verify that the application scope is set to Oracle Financial Cloud spoke.
-   Verify that the MID Server is installed and configured in your ServiceNow instance to connect to the ERP server. For more details, see [Installing the MID Server](../../servicenow-platform/mid-server/mid-server-installation.md).

    **Note:** The MID Server integration is required only for an Oracle Financial Cloud ERP integration using SOAP services.

-   For REST type service, REST API details, as provided by ERP.

Role required: sn\_fcms\_intg.integration\_user

## About this task

If the application requires multiple Oracle Financial Cloud ERP instances, create separate web services for each ERP instance. You can create Integration Service records for entities using the `sn_fcms_intg_service` table.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Finance – ERP Integration** &gt; **ERP Source Configuration**.

2.  Open the ERP source for which you need to configure integration services.

    For example, Oracle Financial Cloud.

3.  In the Integration Services list, select the service that you want to configure.

    ![Configure integration services for Oracle Financial Cloud](../../source-to-pay-operations/image/oracle-fin-integration-service.png "Configure integration services for Oracle Financial Cloud")

4.  On the integration service record, fill in the fields.

Creates a JSON record in the integration service, which is then passed to the ERP subflows to retrieve complete data.

 To pass JSON into the subflow, create a property named "query" and assign it a JSON query as its value, like this:

```
[
  {
    "parameter": "LEGAL_ENTITY_NAME",
    "operator": "=",
    "value": "Vision ADB",
    "operand": "NONE"
  }
]
```

 -   **Enabling Full Pull**:

Use this property to fetch the complete data.

    -   Create a property named "`full_pull`" and set its value to `true`.
    -   Additionally, you can create another property like, "`initial_load_start_date_time`" and set its value to `2025-02-15T04:10:34`.
-   **Enabling Delta Pull**:

Use this property to fetch the incremental data.

Set the value of the "`full_pull`" property to `false`.
