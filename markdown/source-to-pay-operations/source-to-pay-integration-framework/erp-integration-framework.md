# ERP Integration Framework

The Source-to-Pay \(S2P\) ERP Integration Framework enables seamless data exchange between ServiceNow and third-party Enterprise Resource Planning \(ERP\) systems. This framework supports comprehensive integration of primary data, transactional data \(purchase orders, receipts, invoices\), fixed assets, and tax information across multiple ERP instances.

## Key Features

-   User-defined primary data that can be customized to organizational needs.
-   Mapped to organizational legal entities for clear data governance.
-   Associated with target ERP systems for bidirectional data flow.
-   Flexible configuration enabling multiple sources for an organization.

## ERP Sources

An ERP Source represents a specific ERP instance from which data is imported and to which data is exported. Organizations typically maintain multiple ERP instances as systems of record, with each ERP source mapped to a legal entity within the organization.

## ERP Integration Requirements

-   At least one ERP source must be configured for each legal entity within every target instance.
-   Each ERP source should be associated with a specific target ERP system.
-   Organizations can create as many ERP sources as needed to support their structure.

The integration framework clearly defines the system of record responsibilities:

-   Third-party ERP: System of record for primary data entities
-   Source-to-Pay: System of record for purchase orders and receipts
-   Either system: Invoices can be created manually in Source-to-Pay or through external supplier portals

## Integration Architecture

The ERP Integration Framework application loads primary data into Source-to-Pay Operations, enabling various ServiceNow workflows. It also imports selected inbound transactional data objects such as purchase order data that are shared across all Source-to-Pay Operations products.

Both the ERP Integration Framework and Source-to-Pay Integration Framework applications provide an abstraction layer between the Source-to-Pay application and backend systems. This design shields Source-to-Pay workflows and data models from backend-specific integration components and data structures.

**Required Applications**

The integration requires the Finance – ERP Integration store application to be installed.

## MID Server Requirement

A MID Server is required for ERP integrations using SOAP services. The MID Server must be installed and configured to connect to the ERP system server. See [Installing the MID Server](../../servicenow-platform/mid-server/mid-server-installation.md) for details.

**Note:** MID Server integration is only required for SOAP-based integrations, not for REST-based integrations.

## User Roles and Permissions

The ERP Integration Framework supports the following roles and permissions:
