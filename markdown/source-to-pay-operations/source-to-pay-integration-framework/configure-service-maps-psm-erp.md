# Configure service maps for Source-to-Pay

For configuring service maps, provide the connection end point and the ERP credentials that you set up for your authentication profile. Also, create a separate web service record for each service request that you want to customize.

## Before you begin

-   Ensure that the MID Server is installed and configured in your ServiceNow instance to connect to the ERP server. See [Installing the MID Server](../../servicenow-platform/mid-server/mid-server-installation.md) for details.

    **Note:** The MID Server integration is required only for an ERP integration using SOAP services.

-   For SOAP type service, SOAP API details \(WSDL information – soap action and endpoint details\), provided by ERP.
-   For REST type service, REST API details, as provided by ERP.
