# Sales promotion

OEMs create sales promotions and discounts targeted to specific criteria or customers. Channel partners extend these promotions to end customers during sales transactions, and the OEM reimburses dealers for the discounts offered.

This feature enables the seamless collaboration between OEMs and their dealers to manage sales promotions and claims. The sales promotion framework enables the OEMs to publish and manage the promotional campaigns efficiently. The dealer portal enables the dealers to submit claims for reimbursement post product sales transactions.​ There are three parts to the sales promotion​.

-   Creation of sales promotion by the OEM.
-   Creation of claim against the promotion by the dealer.
-   Review and reimbursement for the claim by the OEM.
