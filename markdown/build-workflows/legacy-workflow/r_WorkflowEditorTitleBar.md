# Workflow editor title bar

When a workflow is opened in the canvas, the title bar displays the workflow title and the workflow status in italics. Possible states are **Checked out by &lt;name&gt;** and **Published**.

![](../image/WorkflowTitleBar.png "Workflow editor title bar")

Controls on the right side of the title bar manage the workflow.

-   **Workflow Properties** ![Workflow properties icon](../image/WorkflowPropertiesIcon.png): Opens the current workflow's properties form.
-   **Start** ![Run the workflow icon](../image/RunWorkflowIcon.png): Runs the workflow. This control is only available for workflows running on the Global table that are accessible from all application scopes. To test workflows that are on other tables, insert a record into that table that meets the condition of the workflow.
-   **Validate** ![Validate the workflow icon](../image/ValidateWorkflowIcon.png): Tests the workflow prior to publication. Validation detects potential problems that can prevent the workflow from publishing or cause the workflow to fail. For more information, see [Workflow Validation](c_WorkflowValidation.md).
-   **Help** ![Help icon](../image/HelpIcon.png): Opens documentation to help you create the workflow.

Click the menu icon in the title bar for additional options to configure the workflow.
