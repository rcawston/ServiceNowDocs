# Cancel a workflow

Canceling a workflow stops the workflow from executing and sets the workflow context **State** to **Canceled**. To cancel an executing workflow, you can use the cancelContext\(context\) script. You can define an onCancel script to clean up unresolved workflow activities.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin or workflow\_admin

## About this task

Canceling a workflow attempts to stop the workflow gracefully by injecting a cancel command into the workflow engine.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workflow** &gt; **Active Contexts**.

2.  Select a workflow context record.

3.  Configure form layout to add **On-cancel script** field to form.

    For detailed information about configuring form layout, see [Configuring the form layout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/configure-form-layout.md).

4.  Select the **Cancel** related link.

    A confirmation appears.

    ![Cancel Confirmation](../image/CancelConfirmation.png)

5.  Click **OK**.

    The workflow engine attempts to cancel the workflow gracefully.

    ![Wait for Cancel](../image/WaitForCancel.png)

    If the workflow does not respond to the cancel command, the Force Cancel option appears.

    ![Force Cancel](../image/ForceCancel.png)

6.  Click **Force cancel** to interrupt the thread the workflow is actively executing or click **Continue waiting** to continue waiting for the workflow to cancel gracefully.

    **Warning:** Whenever possible, allow a workflow to cancel gracefully. Forcing a workflow to cancel can leave related workflows and scripts in an unresolved state. You can use an on-cancel script to clean up unresolved artifacts from a cancelled workflow.

## Cancel a workflow with the cancelContext\(context\) script

To cancel an executing workflow, you can use the cancelContext\(context\) script. This script can be useful in cases where a workflow must be canceled in response to an event or where a user must manually cancel a workflow.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

### About this task

For more information, see the [Workflow - cancelContext\(GlideRecord context\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_Workflow_api.md).

## Define an on-cancel script

Canceling a workflow can leave records or scripts in an unresolved state. For example, canceling a service catalog workflow may leave catalog items in the requesting user's cart. An administrator can specify an On-cancel script that runs when the workflow transitions to the Canceled state. This script can notify users, log information, or resolve the state of any scripts run within a workflow activity. The sys\_id of the workflow context is available in this script using the context\_sys\_id variable.

### About this task

On-cancel scripts run asynchronously from the global scope. Your instance workload determines when the system schedules and runs the on-cancel script.

**Important:** Since the system runs on-cancel scripts from the global scope, they cannot call or run scoped script includes.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workflow** &gt; **Workflow Versions**.

2.  Select a workflow version that you have checked out.

    Workflow versions that are not checked out are not editable.

3.  Edit the **On-cancel script** field.

    You may need to configure the form to add this field.

4.  Click **Update**.


### Example

This example script adds a comment to a Requested Item \[sc\_req\_item\] record indicating the workflow for that request has been canceled.

```
var grContext = new GlideRecord("wf_context"); 
grContext.get(context_sys_id); 
var grReq = new GlideRecord("sc_req_item");
 
// The current record may not exist, make sure it exists before modifying it.
if (grReq.get(grContext.id)) {
    grReq.comments = "The workflow processing this item was Canceled. Contact your system administrator for further information.";
    grReq.update();
}
```
