# Playbook activity state mapping

Use playbook activity state mapping to override the status of a playbook card.

A playbook card's state comes from the Activity State by default. Activity states come from the Sub Flow or Flow Action powering the activity.

Activity Definition authors can specify a records to provide the status shown in playbook cards. This record is referred to as an **Experience Status Record**. It is specified within an Activity Definition's experience properties.

![Tables and records for an activity definition](../../process-automation-designer/images/activity-definition-tables-records.png)

Any record from any table can be used as an Experience Status Record. Default activity definitions use **sys\_flow\_data** records as their Experience Status Record.

## Default Activity States

|Status|Flow State|
|------|----------|
|Pending|Flow has not started|
|Ready|Flow is|
|In Progress|Flow is running|
|Complete|Flow has finished|
|Skipped|Flow was skipped due to conditions|
|Error|Flow encountered an error|
|Canceled|Flow was canceled|

Activity states are used in the following:

-   Declarative Action conditions
-   Activity Override conditions
-   Animations
-   Card visual experience

## Exceptions

Business logic doesn't always align one-to-one with the flow. The following are examples of exceptions:

-   An agent clicks **Skip** on an instructional card. The flow displays as complete, but the business logic is skipped.
-   A flow may never complete if a task is waiting for input from an agent to restart a loop. The associated task is effectively complete in this state.

-   **[Playbook activity state-mapping rules](playbook-activity-state-mapping-rules.md)**  
Map playbook activity states to states from the given experience record.
-   **[Playbook activity state-mapping permissions](playbook-act-state-permissions.md)**  
User permissions must be assigned to allow agents to complete or skip activities in playbook using activity state mapping.
