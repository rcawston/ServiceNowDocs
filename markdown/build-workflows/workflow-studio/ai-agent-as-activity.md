# Use AI agent as an activity

Use an existing AI agent as an activity in your playbook to automate tasks. The AI agent gathers the required context, performs the work, and produces outputs that subsequent activities can consume.

## Before you begin

Role required: playbook.admin or pd\_author.

Make sure that Now Assist AI agents plugin is installed and you have AI agents available in your instance. For information about installing the Now Assist AI agents plugin, see [Install Now Assist AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/install-ai-agents-plugins.md). For information about creating an AI agent, see [Create an AI agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/configure-next-best-action-agent.md).

## About this task

When you add an AI agent to the activity, you select the agent, provide an objective for the agent to complete, and define the expected outputs. You can also define whether you want to run the agent on behalf of the user who triggered the playbook, or the current user. You can interact with the agent from within the playbook, without opening the Now Assist panel.

2.  Select the playbook where you want to add the **Use an AI agent** activity.

3.  In a new or an existing stage, select **Add an activity**.

## Using AI agent in a CSM playbook

In the following example, Alex, a CSM/FSM Workspace user, is working on a customer complaint about a product issue. The playbook uses the Complaint Case Research Plan Agent in the research stage to analyze the complaint and create relevant tasks for the next steps. The AI agent is configured to run as the active user in this playbook.

Alex performs all interactions with the AI agent within the playbook, without opening the Now Assist panel.

1.  When the playbook reaches the research stage, Alex selects **Start Now Assist** to run the AI agent.

2.  Alex can view the tasks that the AI agent is performing.

    ![The AI agent is running and Alex can view the tasks being performed by the agent.](../images/use-ai-agent-status.png)

3.  After analyzing the case and similar cases, the AI agent recommends adding four tasks and prompts Alex for confirmation. Alex can remove any of the recommended tasks or select **Confirm** for the AI agent to create the tasks.

    ![The AI agent prompts for permission before creating tasks for the next steps.](../images/use-ai-agent-worknote.png)

4.  After receiving the confirmation, the AI agent creates the tasks and marks the activity as complete.
