# Create a sample playbook

Create a sample playbook to standardize and automate how Service Desk agents handle chat interactions with VIP users.

## Before you begin

-   Enable the **Process Automation Designer for App Engine \[com.glide.pad.license\]** plugin with a subscription to the ServiceNow AI Platform App Engine. For more information, see [Activate Playbooks](activate-process-automation-designer.md).
-   Ensure that your current application is set to **Global**. For more information, see [Application picker](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/c_ApplicationPicker.md).
-   Role required: admin or playbook.admin

## About this task

In the following procedure, you can step through an example of how to digitize a manual business process on the ServiceNow AI Platform using Playbooks in Workflow Studio to standardize and automate how Service Desk agents handle chat interactions with VIP users.

The manual business process for this example consists of the following stages:

1.  **Identify and Log**: A Service Desk agent learns of an issue that a VIP user is facing while chatting with the user in a messaging application. The Service Desk agent creates an interaction record to track this issue.
2.  **Classify and Diagnose**: The Service Desk agent associates an incident record with the interaction and sets the incident's priority to High. The agent then enters the Assigned To user for the incident.
3.  **Communicate Work in Progress**: The assignee updates the incident record's state to Work in Progress and emails the VIP user when progress is made on the incident.
4.  **Resolve**: When the incident is resolved, the assignee emails the resolution information to the VIP user.

## Procedure

1.  Create a playbook named **Handle Interactions with VIPs**.

    1.  Navigate to **Process Automation** &gt; **Workflow Studio** &gt; **Playbooks**.

    2.  In the main header, click **Create a new process**.

    3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

        |Field|Action|
        |-----|------|
        |Label|Enter `Handle Interactions with VIPs`.|
        |Description|Enter `This process defines how Service Desk agents can handle interaction records that are created for VIP users.`|
        |Application|Select **Global**.|

    4.  Click **Select a trigger**.

    5.  Click the **Define your own trigger conditions for when your process runs** option.

    6.  From the list of trigger options, select **Record Create**.

    7.  Click **Set your trigger conditions**.

    8.  In the Table list, select **Interaction \[interaction\]**.

    9.  Use the [condition builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/c_ConditionBuilder.md) to add the following condition to your trigger:

        **\[Opened for-&gt;VIP\]** **\[is\]** **\[True\]**.

    10. Click **Go to Designer**.

    The Playbooks design environment appears.

2.  Add a stage for each stage in your process.

    1.  Click **+ Add stage** to add the first stage to your process.

    2.  In the stage properties panel's **Label** field, enter `Classify and Diagnose`.

        **Note:** Because the **Identify and Log** stage triggers this process, don't add it as a stage.

    3.  In the **Description** field, enter `Associate an incident with the interaction`.

    4.  In the **When to start** field, leave **Immediately** selected, and then click **Save**.

    5.  Click **+ Add stage** to add another stage to your process.

    6.  In the stage side panel's **Label** field, enter `Communicate Work in Progress`.

    7.  In the **Description** field, enter `Notify VIP of work in progress`.

    8.  In the **When to start** field, leave **After Previous** selected, and then click **Save**.

    9.  Click **+ Add stage** to add the final stage to your process.

    10. In the stage side panel's **Label** field, enter `Resolve`.

## Result

Your process appears in as a playbook. Here, agents and fulfillers can get a task-oriented view of the automated business process. Agents can step through the activities that you set up to see where the record is in the overall process.
