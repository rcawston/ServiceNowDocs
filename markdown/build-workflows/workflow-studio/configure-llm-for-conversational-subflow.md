# Configure LLM to generate descriptions for conversational subflows

Choose which LLM you want to use by default to generate descriptions for inputs, outputs, and skills for conversational subflows.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

In the conversational subflow settings, you can use generative AI to generate descriptions for skills, inputs, and outputs of a conversational subflow. You can select a default LLM to generate these descriptions out of any of the following preconfigured LLMs:

-   Anthropic Claude on AWS
-   Azure OpenAI
-   Google Gemini
-   Now LLM

**Note:** This configuration affects only the capability to generate the descriptions.

## Procedure

1.  Select **All**.

2.  In the **Filter** search box, enter `sys_one_extend_capability.list`.

3.  In the OneExtend Capabilities list, search for the application `Conversational subflows and actions`.

4.  Select the record for which you want to change the LLM:

    -   Input output description generator
    -   Skill description generator
    The **OneExtend Definition Configs** tab displays separate rows for each configured LLM. The following image shows one row each for Now LLM and Azure OpenAI.![Options to select the default LLM.](../images/csa-llm-list.png)

5.  In the **Default** column of your selected LLM, set the value as **true**.

    Once you select the default LLM, ensure that the Default field value for any other LLM is set to **false**.

6.  Select **Update**.
