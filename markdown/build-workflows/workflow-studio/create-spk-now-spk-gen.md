# Create spoke and build actions using the spoke generation skill in Now Assist

Automate an integration and generate reusable actions by providing the required third-party API documentation snippet as an input.

## Before you begin

**Important:** This Now Assist skill is turned on by default. The skill will be automatically available to appropriate role users for the application. For more information, see [Now Assist skills, agents, and agentic workflows on by default](../../intelligent-experiences/now-assist-skills/now-assist-skills-on-by-default.md).

-   Role required: admin
-   Create the required action categories for your integration in the Action Category \[sys\_hub\_category\] table.
-   Confirm that ServiceNow Integration Hub Professional Pack Installer \(com.glide.hub.integrations.professional\) is installed and the license is entitled.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Process Automation** &gt; **Workflow Studio**.

2.  Click **Create new** &gt; **Spoke**.

3.  On the Spoke Info screen, specify if you want to create the spoke in a new scope or an existing scope.

    1.  If you choose to create the spoke in a new scope, select an image as the logo for your integration and fill in the fields.

        Here, we will go through an integration with LearnOrbit as an example.

        |Field|Description|
        |-----|-----------|
        |Spoke name|Name to identify the custom spoke.|
        |Description|Description about the custom spoke.|

        ![Spoke generator window.](../images/build-spoke-now-assist.png "Spoke generator window")

        **Note:**

        The value of **App scope name** is the format: `x_<company-code>_<spoke-name>_<spoke>`. By default, the &lt;company-code&gt; is, `snc`. You can configure the company code by configuring **Value** of the system property, **glide.appcreator.company.code**.![Configuring Value of glide.appcreator.company.code.](../images/spoke-gen-sys-property.png)

        This configured value is used when the value **App scope name** is generated.![Configured value of App scope name.](../images/spoke-gen-app-scope.png)

    2.  If you choose to create the spoke in an existing scope, select an image as the logo for your integration and fill in the fields.

        Here, we will go through an integration with LearnOrbit as an example.

7.  On the Generate action screen, paste the required content from the 360Learning API documentation in **Now Assist Context**.

    In this example, we will copy the documentation related to the enrollUser action and paste it in **Now Assist Context**.

    **Note:** Ensure that you paste the documentation related to only one action at a time.

9.  If you want to modify the generated action, modify the provided content in **Now Assist Context** accordingly and click **Regenerate preview**.

    If there are any missing fields in the content provided for **Now Assist Context**, an error message is displayed.

10. Click **Continue**.

11. On the Select connection and category screen, for **Connection and credential alias**, click **Create new**.

    |Configuration Template for authentication|Required authentication mechanism for this integration. Ensure that the authentication mechanism is compatible with the third-party application.|

13. Click **Create alias and continue**.

14. On the Configure connection and credential alias screen, fill in the fields to configure the alias.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Connection Information|
    |Connection Name|Name to identify the connection record.|
    |Connection URL|Base URL to connect to the third-party instance or server.|

    The connection alias record is created.

16. On the Select connection and category, select the required action category.
