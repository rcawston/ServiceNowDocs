# Exploring Playbook

Playbook enable process owners to author cross-enterprise workflows and create a single, unified process. Build the underlying processes for playbooks that Playbook Experience agents and fulfillers use.

## Playbooks benefits

Workflow Studio Playbooks enables you, as a business playbook owner, to organize Workflow Studio content into unified and digitized cross-enterprise processes. With Playbooks, you gain these benefits:

-   Connect multiple flows and actions into an end-to-end business workflow.
-   Reuse existing Workflow Studio flows, subflows, or actions to automate playbook activities.
-   Organize playbook activities in a digitized task board or diagram interface.
-   Guide agents and fulfillers through complicated playbooks from start to finish, improving customer experience and task resolution. Build your playbooks in Workflow Studio, and then design and embed your Playbook Experience in legacy workspace, UI Builder, ServiceNow Mobile Platform, Service Portal, and more.
-   Consolidate separate business processes across the organization.
-   Define a consistent record life cycle from creation to completion.
-   Pass data between the activities and stages of a business process.
-   Specify the conditions and the order in which activities and stages run.
-   Visualize and manage the activities and stages of your process.

## Creating a well-designed playbook

The automated business processes that you design guide your end users and help them focus on the tasks and information that matter to them. A well-designed playbook can do these things:

-   Start up, or trigger, automatically for the types of records that your end users care about
-   Reuse activities from existing [Workflow Studio](workflow-studio.md) content
-   Has well-defined stages that end users can follow for a record
-   Clearly show the next steps that end users must take to move through a record's life cycle

## Playbooks content

Playbooks has these components:

-   **Playbooks**

    A playbook is a ServiceNow AI Platform® representation of a cross-enterprise business process for your organization. A playbook owner is responsible for creating and maintaining a playbook.

-   **Triggers**

    A trigger specifies when to start running your playbook.

-   **Stages**

    A stage is a grouped sequence of activities in a playbook. A playbook owner creates a stage to specify a logical grouping of activities. A stage in your overall business process.

-   **Activities**

    An activity defines the [Workflow Studio](workflow-studio.md) content that powers the playbook's automation. An activity can also specify the user-facing experience that the playbook produces when it runs.
