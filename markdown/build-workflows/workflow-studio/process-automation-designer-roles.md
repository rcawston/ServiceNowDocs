# Playbooks roles

Grant users one or more Playbooks roles to enable them to create triggers, playbooks, and activity definitions.

## Roles

To learn more about managing per-user subscriptions, see [Managing per-user subscriptions in Subscription Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/managing-user-subscriptions-v2.md) and contact your account representative.

System administrators can grant users access to Playbooks by assigning [delegated development permissions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/delegated-development-and-deployment/c_DelegatedDevelopment.md) or directly assigning [Roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/user-administration/exploring-user-administration.md). Additionally, playbook authors can create additional filters for runtime user access as they build a playbook in Workflow Studio. The following user roles are available for Playbooks:

</table>**Note:** Granting users Playbooks roles does not automatically allow them to access the Workflow Studio design environment. Granting users access to Workflow Studio may be helpful when creating activity definitions.
