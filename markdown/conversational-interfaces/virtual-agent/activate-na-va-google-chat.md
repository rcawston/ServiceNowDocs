# Activate Now Assist in Virtual Agent for Google chat

Add Now Assist in Virtual Agent to your Google chat bot.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin or virtual\_agent\_admin

Create a self-configured bot for Google chat. For more information, see [Integrate Virtual Agent with Google chat using the self-configured bot](installing-ci-google-chat.md).

**Note:** Ensure you've updated the version of your Google chat app in the **Version** field.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Conversational Interfaces** &gt; **Assistant Designer**.

2.  Under **Now Assist in Virtual Agent \(default\)**, select the **Edit** button.

3.  Under the **Settings** tab, select **Display experiences**, then select **Channels**.

4.  Choose the self-configured bot for the Teams channel experience you want to activate by selecting the **Select row** check box next to its name.

5.  Select **Save and continue**.

6.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Conversational Interfaces** &gt; **Channels and Integrations**.

7.  Under Integrations, in the Google chat tile, select **Manage**.

8.  In the Self-configured tile, next to your bot's name, select the **Manage bot** icon \(![](../images/three-dots-icon.png)\), and then select **Manage bot** from the drop-down menu.

9.  Select **Edit configuration**, and then select the check box next to **Google chat**.

10. Select **Save**.

    The bot is now active for Google chat, and the bot's Configuration tab opens.

11. Select **Download** to save the manifest zip file.


## What to do next

Upload the manifest to Google chat to make your bot experience available in the Microsoft global apps store, which will also activate the Custom Engine Agent \(CEA\) in Google chat. For more information, see [Upload the manifest package file to publish your bot](upload-package-file-msteams.md).
