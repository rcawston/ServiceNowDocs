# Test topic and NLU model translations

Test a translated Virtual Agent topic and the localized NLU model to ensure that it works as expected in a conversation.

## Before you begin

**Note:** An updated Assistant Designer Asset library user interface is available when you install Now Assist in Virtual Agent and turn on the Now Assist Topics skill. This content assumes that you have activated this skill and can see the list view. If this skill is not activated, you see the legacy UI and topics page. For more information, see [Virtual Agent Designer legacy topics page](vad-prev-topics-page.md).

Role required: virtual\_agent\_admin or admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Conversational Interfaces** &gt; **Virtual Agent** &gt; **Designer**.

2.  Set the discovery type toggle switch to **NLU/keyword**, followed by the NLU topic you want to test.

3.  Under the Languages tab, select **Manage languages**.

4.  In the **Select NLU Model** list, select the model group to test.

5.  In the **View language** list, select a language.

6.  In the **Test** column for an intent, select **Test**.

7.  On the test window, run the conversation and review the results in the test tabs.

    For more information about using the chat test window, see [Testing NLU/Keyword topics](va-designer-testing.md).

    The following image illustrates how you can test a French translation.

8.  End the test by closing the window.


## What to do next

Use the test results to modify the topic as needed. Continue testing as you adjust your topic and the NLU language mappings.

When the topic is ready, publish the topic to make it available to users. You can publish all or some of the NLU mappings. For more information about publishing a topic, see [Publish a Virtual Agent topic](publish-virtual-agent-topic.md).

**Tip:** You can view localization insights from the **Manage languages** page and the Virtual Agent Designer home page. Navigate to **All** &gt; **Conversational Interfaces** &gt; **Virtual Agent** &gt; **Designer**, and then select **Localization Insights** from the Resources.
