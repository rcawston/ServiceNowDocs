2.  Select the **com.glide.cs.exclude.liveagent.support** system property to open it.
3.  Add **Bot To Bot** to the **Value** field.

    ![The Value field for the system property contains "Alexa,Google Assistant,Bot to Bot." These channels are excluded from supporting Agent Chat.](../images/va-api-exclude-liveagent-btb.png "Exclude the Bot To Bot channel from Agent Chat")
