# Add a condition builder to promoted assets

You can define a condition for a given promoted Virtual Agent asset to bring it higher up on the list of promoted assets in a panel conversation.

## Before you begin

Role required: virtual\_agent\_admin or admin.

To define a condition for an asset, you must promote it first. For more information, see [Promote or demote LLM conversational subflows, actions, and topics in Assistant Designer](promote-demote-va-topics.md).

## About this task

Add a condition to a chosen Virtual Agent topic to have it displayed higher on the list of promoted assets in a panel conversation. This condition overrides the **Number** value on the Promoted Skills \[sys\_cs\_context\_profile\_promoted\_skill\_list\] table.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All**, then enter `sys_cs_context_profile_promoted_skill.list` in the filter.

2.  Select your chosen promoted asset from the list.

3.  In the **Condition** field, set the chosen condition for your promoted asset.

    For example, `URL > contains > conversation`.

4.  In the **Condition mode** field, select your condition.

    **Note:** In the current release, **Simple** is the only available condition mode.

5.  Select **Update**.


## Result

The promoted asset’s **Condition** on the Promoted Skills table shows the defined condition.

The promoted asset now shows **Condition defined** next to the **Promoted** checkmark.

The promoted asset also displays at the top of the list of promoted assets in a Virtual Agent Now Assist panel chat window.
