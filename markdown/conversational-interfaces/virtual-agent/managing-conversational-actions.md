# Managing conversational actions in Assistant Designer

View and manage conversational actions through Assistant Designer.

**Note:** An updated Assistant Designer Asset library user interface is available when you install Now Assist in Virtual Agent and turn on the Now Assist Topics skill. This content assumes that you have activated this skill and can see the list view. If this skill is not activated, you see the legacy UI and topics page. For more information, see [Virtual Agent Designer legacy topics page](vad-prev-topics-page.md).

When you have the admin or virtual\_agent\_admin role, you can work with conversational actions in Assistant Designer.

Conversational actions currently can't be created in Assistant Designer. You can only view and edit them in Assistant Designer. Conversational actions can be created, tested, and deleted only in Workflow Studio. For more details on creating actions, see [Create an action in Workflow Studio](../../build-workflows/workflow-studio/create-action.md).

When you open an action, a tab is displayed in the navigation header bar. This tab opens the action in Workflow Studio within the Assistant Designer environment. The following columns appear by default:

|Column|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Name|Name of the action. Select the name of the action to work with that action directly in Assistant Designer.|
|Type|Action.|
|Status|Status type such as Published.|
|Active|Whether the GenAI skill is active or inactive.|
|Last modified|Time that the subflow was last modified.|
|Description|Description of the action.|

Use the row actions icon ![](../images/kebab-menu.png) to work with visibility settings for **Promoted**, **Discoverable**, **Visible**, and **Active**:

|Option|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Promoted|Option to toggle the action's **Promoted** status to show as a suggested conversational asset in the virtual assistant.|
|Discoverable|Option to toggle the action's **Discoverable** status. If discoverable, the action is invoked when matched with a user's utterance.|
|Visible|Option to toggle the action's visibility to users. If visible, the action appears whenever the **Show me everything** option is selected in the conversation.|
|Active|Option to toggle the action's active status. If active, the action is available within the conversation.|
|Delete|Option to delete the action is not applicable within Virtual Agent Designer because actions can only be deleted within Workflow Studio.|

Conversational subflows and actions only appear to users during a Virtual Agent conversation if the Subflows and actions skill is turned on in Now Assist Admin. Conversational subflows and actions appear in Now Assist Panel as long as the Subflows and action skill is active.
