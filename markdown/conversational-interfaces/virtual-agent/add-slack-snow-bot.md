# Integrate ServiceNow Virtual Agent with Slack

Add the Virtual Agent bot to your ServiceNow® instance to integrate with Slack.

## Before you begin

Ensure that you have installed the Conversational Integration with Slack plugin \(sn\_va\_slack\) on your ServiceNow instance before adding any integrations.

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Conversational Interfaces** &gt; **Settings**.

2.  In **General Settings** under **Channels and integrations**, select **View All**.

    The Channels and integrations page opens.

3.  Under the Available Channels section in the Slack tile, select **Add Integrations**, and select **Integrate with ServiceNow Virtual Agent**.

    **Note:** The **Add Integrations** drop-down is available only after installing the Conversational Integration with Slack plugin \(sn\_va\_slack\) on your ServiceNow instance.

4.  Enter your Slack workspace URL to sign into your Slack workspace, and select **Continue**.

    **Note:** Ensure that you input the name of the Slack workspace for which you have access.

5.  Sign in to your ServiceNow® instance.

6.  Select **Allow** when Slack requests permission to access your workspace.

7.  If the selected workspace ant has already been assigned to Virtual Agent, you must first uninstall from the previously associated instance.

    **Note:**

    Starting from Utah release, if your Slack workspace is already associated with another ServiceNow instance, but if you intend to associate it with a new instance, then you're asked to reach out to the administrator to first uninstall it from the previously associated instance. For more information, see [Override Slack integration](override-slack-install.md).

    When Virtual Agent has been successfully installed on the Slack workspace, a completion message appears.

8.  Select **Go to Slack** to manage the Slack app.

9.  Select **Continue to manage channels and integrations** to manage the integration on your ServiceNow instance.

    The Slack application appears in the list of integrations.


## What to do next
