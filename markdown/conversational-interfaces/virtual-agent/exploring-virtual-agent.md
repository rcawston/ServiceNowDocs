# Exploring Virtual Agent

The ServiceNow Virtual Agent platform provides user assistance through conversations within an intelligent messaging interface. Design and build automated conversations with an out-of-the-box system that help your users quickly obtain information, make decisions, and perform common work tasks with Virtual Agent.

## Overview of Virtual Agent

Virtual Agent helps solve ordinary issues and delivers results for common requests, leaving your agents and technicians free to focus on more complex user issues. You can change the look and feel of the chat experience to suit each audience for your business, including running your chatbot in a variety of common or custom messaging channels. Monitor your bot's success with the Conversational Analytics dashboard.

When you add Now Assist in Virtual Agent skills, your developers have access to large language model \(LLM\) topic discovery. The Now Assist topics skill includes LLM controls that make topic authoring easier so that you can deliver self-service solutions more quickly.

## AI agents in Virtual Agent

Virtual Agent supports AI agents. When a user ask a question to the virtual agent, the agent understands the query and can reason, plan, and execute across AI agents, virtual agent topics, conversational actionsand sub-flows, catalog, KB, AI agent skill kit, and any Now Assist for Virtual Agent supported skills to help the user. Virtual Agent supports multi-intent query with AI agents if there are associated AI agents per user query.
