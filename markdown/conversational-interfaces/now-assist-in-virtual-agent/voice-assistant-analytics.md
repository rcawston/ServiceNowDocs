# Voice page in assistant analytics

Monitor the performance of voice assistants from the Voice page of Assistant analytics in Assistant Designer.

The Voice dashboard page aggregates key metrics related to voice assistant usage and performance, including total conversations, deflection rate, conversation outcomes, satisfaction scores, response time, tool execution performance, and performance of AI agents invoked by voice assistants.

The visualizations on the Voice page help you with the following:

-   Monitor the volume and outcomes of voice assistant interactions to assess adoption and identify areas for improvement.
-   Track inferred customer satisfaction \(CSAT\) score and engagement metrics, helping you enhance user experience and efficiency.
-   Analyze AI agent performance and conversations deflected to optimize voice workflows and reduce reliance on live agents.

You can filter the dashboard data using the following options:

-   Filter by voice assistant: View metrics for specific voice assistants.
-   Filter by language: View metrics by conversation language, such as English, German, Spanish, and so on
-   Filter by communication channel type: View metrics by channel, such as phone, mobile app - iOS, mobile app - Android, or web browser.
-   Filter by date range: View metrics for a specific time period.

## Voice assistants

-   **Percent voice conversations deflected**

    This area of the dashboard shows the percentage of voice conversations successfully self-handled by voice assistants, measured through large language model \(LLM\) transcript analysis. This metric measures the effectiveness of voice assistants in handling user queries independently.

## Additional conversation outcomes

-   **Conversations transferred to a live agent**

    This area of the dashboard shows the number of conversations transferred from a voice assistant to a live agent for further assistance. This metric indicates how often users require support beyond what the voice assistant can provide. Use this data to identify common escalation triggers and optimize assistant workflows to reduce unnecessary transfers.

    ![Conversations transferred to a live agent](../image/NAinVA-assistant-designer-analytics-voice-conv-live-agent.png "Conversations transferred to a live agent")

-   **Number of tickets created**

    This area of the dashboard shows the number of tickets, for example, incident and case records, created for follow up actions after a conversation. This highlights instances where user issues required formal tracking and resolution. Monitor ticket creation trends to assess assistant effectiveness and identify areas for improvement in issue resolution.

## Conversations and user insights

-   **Immediate live agent transfers**

    This area of the dashboard shows the number of conversations where users requested a transfer to a live agent within 30 seconds of starting the call. This metric applies to phone conversations only. Use this metric to help identify scenarios that drive near immediate escalation to a live agent.

    ![Immediate live agent transfers.](../image/NAinVA-assistant-designer-analytics-voice-immediate-transfers.png "Immediate live agent transfers")

-   **Inferred customer satisfaction \(CSAT\) score**

    This area of the dashboard shows the average inferred CSAT score for voice conversations in the selected data range, calculated through LLM transcript analysis. Scored on a 5-point scale, 1 = least satisfied and 5 = most satisfied. This metric tracks user sentiment for voice assistant interactions. Track CSAT trends to evaluate the impact of assistant updates and guide improvements in user experience.

-   **Average voice conversation duration**

    This area of the dashboard shows the average duration of voice conversations excluding the time spent with a live agent after transfer, so the value reflects only the AI-handled portion of the call. This metric helps assess the efficiency of voice interactions. Use this metric to identify opportunities to streamline conversations and reduce resolution time.
