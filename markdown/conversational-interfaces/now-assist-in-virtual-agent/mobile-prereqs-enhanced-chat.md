# Mobile app prerequisites for enhanced chat

Now Assist in Virtual Agent provides users with a content-driven and search-driven generative AI experience. Depending on whether you have opted into standard or enhanced chat when configuring your assistant, you can integrate three different mobile app components with an assistant.

For information on choosing how you want Now Assist in Virtual Agent to display on your mobile app, see [Mobile Now Assist display experience for Virtual Agent](../../mobile/mobile-na-display-experience-va.md).
