## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Assistant Designer**.

2.  From the **Assistants** tab, select **Edit** for the assistant that you want to edit.

    If you’re only able to view an assistant and are unable to edit it, it’s because you don’t have permission to edit the assistant in a specific domain. For more information about assistants in different domains, see [View assistants](view-assistants.md).

    Edit mode opens the assistant in a sub-tab where you can manage and test your chat assistant.

    The sub-tab shows the assistant name and whether it's a chat or voice assistant.

    The Overview page shows the following components:

    -   Assistant name
    -   Assistant status: active or inactive
    -   Assistant hierarchy: primary or secondary assistant. This section only appears if an assistant is set as a primary or secondary assistant.
    -   Assistant description
    -   Display experience
    -   Additional chat features: web search mode, response streaming, document uploads, closed chats, and voice input \(for Now Assist panel Platform assistant\).
3.  From the Overview page, select the appropriate button or link to make your edits.

    -   In **Search sources**, assign search sources to a chat assistant. Search sources are used to determine what the assistant looks at to answer user queries. If there were any search configurations that were previously done, those configurations would remain. For more information, see [Assign search sources to a chat assistant](add-info-sources-assistant.md).
    -   In **Knowledge Graphs**, edit your Knowledge Graph schema to represent semantic relationships in your data. For more information, see [Add a Knowledge Graph schema to a chat assistant](add-kg-schema-assistant.md).

    -   In **Asset visibility**, all assets that are assigned to the assistant are shown.
        -   Discoverable: Discoverable assets can be found and used by your assistant when they match what a user says.
        -   Visible: Visible assets appear when users select **Show me everything** in the assistant.
        -   Promoted: Promoted assets give users quick access to your most helpful options. Features up to 6 at the start of every chat.
            -   The number of manually promoted assets is shown.
            -   The assets that have been manually promoted are shown, including asset name, asset description, asset type, and the condition label.
            -   The manually promoted assets can be reordered.
            -   When a promoted asset is deleted by selecting the trash can icon, the asset is demoted from the assistant. The asset still exists within the assistant.
            -   When you select **Add Assets** you can select an **Asset Type** from the drop-down menu and then select a specific existing asset. Select **Save** to promote the asset.
5.  From the **Settings** tab, select the page that needs editing.

    ![Edit assistant settings.](../image/NAinVA-edit-settings-122025.png "Edit assistant settings")

    -   In **Basic details**, you can edit the name and description of the assistant. Names can't be duplicative of another assistant. You can set your assistant as a primary assistant and link it to secondary assistants.

        **Note:** For Now Assist panel Platform and Developer assistants, the basic details, such as name and description, can't be edited. For more information, see [Create a chat assistant](create-assistant.md).
