# Display your assistant on Platform or ServiceNow Studio

Use a chat experience for your Now Assist panel - Platform \(default\) assistant or Now Assist panel - Developer assistant.

## Before you begin

See [Add assets to a chat assistant](add-assets.md).

Role required: virtual\_agent\_admin or admin

## About this task

For Now Assist panel – Platform assistant, new customers and upgraded instances have the option to opt into the premium chat experience. ServiceNow performs a set of readiness checks to confirm that your instance is eligible for premium chat. If your instance doesn’t meet the requirements, you can continue using your existing standard or enhanced chat experience. After an upgrade, there may be a delay before premium chat is available to choose from.

**Note:** Premium chat does not apply to instances in regulated markets \(Government Cloud Community\), instances that use domain separation, or regional data routing.

For more information about premium chat, see [Premium chat](../../intelligent-experiences/now-assist-panel-premium.md), otherwise, proceed to step 1.

Due to the premium chat upgrade, legacy messages \(chat messages\) and legacy fallbacks \(chat fallbacks\) settings haven't been migrated and you must review, configure, and customize them in premium messages and premium fallbacks. See [Manage an assistant chat experience](manage-assistant-chat-experience.md). If you need help, contact Support.

For Now Assist panel – Developer assistant, premium chat is not available. Proceed to step 2.

## Procedure

1.  Select a chat experience for your Now Assist panel - Platform assistant \(default\).

    1.  The **Add ServiceNow platform** &gt; **Unified Navigation app shell** is preselected as the display experience.

        **Note:** If you're a new or upgrading customer, you can edit your chat experience from premium chat to your previous chat experience \(standard or enhanced chat\). By default, the **sn\_nowassist\_va.enable\_nap\_aix\_experience** system property is set to `false`. Setting the system property to `true` disables chat experience editing.

    2.  Select the pencil icon if you want to edit the chat experience. The **Edit chat experience** modal appears.
