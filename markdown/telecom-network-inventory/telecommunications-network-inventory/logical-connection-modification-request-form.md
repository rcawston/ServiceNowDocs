    2.  Two change tasks for modification and revision are created with the open and closed status respectively.
2.  Open the Modify Logical or Physical connection change task to start modifying the duplicated logical or physical connection and operationalize further. To learn more, see [Operationalize a configuration item](operationalize-a-configuration-item.md).
3.  In the process of revision of physical connection modification, the logical connections associated with physical connection ports are updated during the operationalization process.
