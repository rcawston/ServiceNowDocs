Methods for capacity calculation. Select one from the following.-   **Static Value**

A fixed or constant value is used to calculate the capacity. The static value approach uses a predetermined metric to calculate the capacity without considering a field in the record that you query.

-   **Aggregate query count**

A database query that uses an aggregate function to calculate the capacity. In this strategy, you query a related field in a record that is present in the entity table. This type of query is useful for getting summary information about the field in a table, such as the total number of records that meet specific conditions.

-   **Value field**

Use this strategy to check a particular value in a query table, which is present in the database.

-   **Script**

An advanced strategy approach, where a script is used for querying.


Depending on the strategy that you’re selected, additional fields appear in the form. To learn more about the additional fields, see [Capacity function additional fields](capacity-function-additional-fields.md).
