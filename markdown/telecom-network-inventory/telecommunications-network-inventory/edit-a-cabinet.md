# Edit a cabinet

Edit a cabinet to remove, add, or move the equipment from the selected cabinet. Organize and upgrade the components within the cabinet using the Telecommunications Network Inventory application.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ni\_core.inventory\_admin, sn\_ni\_core.inventory\_agent

3.  Select a cabinet from the displayed list.

    A dashboard displays all equipment types added under the cabinet along with the cabinet view and information of the selected equipment.

4.  Select **Edit Cabinet**.

    Instead of the equipment types and cabinet view, a list of all equipment, and the front view of both edit configuration and current configuration is displayed.

5.  From the displayed list of equipment, search for the equipment to add in a cabinet by using either the filters or the search box.

    -   The existing filters automatically clear on entering a search. And, applying a filter clears your search terms.
    -   The equipment list can also be sorted based on latest creation date, highest number of Rack Units, and weight.
    -   The list shows all the equipment records included in the sn\_ni\_core.equipment system property, and the equipment that aren't in the cabinet.
    -   The info \(![info icon](../image/icon-info.png)\) expands and displays the equipment details on selecting an equipment or the info button.
