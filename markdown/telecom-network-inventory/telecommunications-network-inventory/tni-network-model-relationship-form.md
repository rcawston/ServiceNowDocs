</td></tr><tr><td>

Count

</td><td>

Numbers of child product models that can be created under a parent product model when a template is created.**Note:** This attribute is only for **Equipment to Slot**, **Rack to Slot**, **Equipment to Network Interface**, **Interface card to Slot**, **Interface card to Network Interface**, **Cable to Strand**, and **Logical Connection to Channel** relationship types.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Root product model

</td><td>

Grandparent model of the interface card for compatibility. Either select the equipment model or the interface card model. Then, select the search icon \(![Search icon.](../image/search.png)\) and select a model. **Note:** This attribute is only visible for the **Slot to Interface card** relationship type.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Parent product model

</td><td>

Product model that is the parent to the child product model. Select the search icon \(![Search icon.](../image/search.png)\) and select a model.**Note:** In the Rack-to-Slot relationship, the parent product model is the equipment holder model with the model category as Rack.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Child product model

</td><td>

Product model that is the child to the parent product model. Select the search icon \(![Search icon.](../image/search.png)\) and select a model.**Note:** In the Rack to Slot relationship, the child product model is the equipment holder with model category as Slot.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Sequence

</td><td>

Sequence number of the child entities for a model relationship. If you enter a number in the **Count** field, the **Sequence** field appears.

 The default value is 1. If the parent model has multiple relationships, the sequence number for the first relationship is set to 1 and the number following the highest value of the first relationship is set for the consecutive relationships. For example, let's say that your equipment has a model relationship with two slots and two ports. When the relationship is created, the sequence number of the slots and ports are set to 1 and 3.

 **Note:** This attribute is only for **Rack to Slot**, **Equipment to Slot**, **Equipment to Network Interface**, **Interface card to Slot**, **Interface card to Network Interface**, **Cable to Strand**, and **Logical Connection to Channel** relationship types.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Parent bandwidth

</td><td>

Bandwidth of the parent product model.**Note:** This attribute is only visible for the **Logical Connection to Channel** relationship type.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Child bandwidth

</td><td>

Bandwidth of the child product model.**Note:** This attribute is only visible for the **Logical Connection to Channel** relationship type.
