# Define your inventory groups

An inventory group is a collection of CIs that lets you apply CI actions collectively to all the CIs in Telecommunications Network Inventory application. By defining inventory groups, you can group different CIs, and apply actions to all CIs.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ni\_core.inventory\_admin, sn\_ni\_core.inventory\_agent

**Note:** An inventory agent and inventory admin only can review, create, and update an inventory group. Also, only an inventory admin can delete a group.

## About this task

An inventory group represents a group of configuration items\(CIs\). In a group, you can add any CI but you cannot be duplicate a CI.

When you create an inventory group, it creates a group in the inventory group\[cmdb\_group\] table. To learn more, see [Data model](uses-for-network-inventory-data.md).
