## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  Find the Telecommunications Network Inventory application \(sn\_ni\_adv\) using the filter criteria and search bar.

    **Note:** Installation of TNI Advanced leads to automatic installation of TNI Core without its demo data. You need to manually load or install the demo data for TNI Core demo data.

    You can search for the application by its name \(Network Inventory\) or ID. If you can't find the application, you might have to request it from the ServiceNow Store.

    Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/store-release-notes/page/release-notes/store/sn-store-release-notes.html).

3.  In the Application installation dialog box, review the application dependencies.

    Dependent plugins and applications appear if they’re yet to be installed, are currently installed, or must be installed. If any plugins or applications require installation, you must install them before you can install Telecommunications Network Inventory.

4.  If demo data is available and you want to install it, select the **Load demo data** check box.

    Demo data are the sample records that describe application features for common use cases. Load the demo data when you first install the application on a development or test instance.

5.  Select **Install**.
