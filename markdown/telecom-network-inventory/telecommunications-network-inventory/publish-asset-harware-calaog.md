# Publish an asset to the hardware catalog

Publish an asset to the hardware catalog so that you can procure the asset by using the Telecommunications Network Inventory application integration with the Hardware Asset Management application.

## Before you begin

Before you can publish an asset to the hardware catalog, make sure that an inventory model record has already been created for that asset. If there's no record, you can create an inventory model record. To learn more, see [Create inventory models](creating-your-inventory-models.md).

Role required: sn\_ni\_core.inventory\_admin, sn\_ni\_core.telco\_inventory\_catalog\_manager

## About this task

You can publish an asset to the hardware catalog to make it available as a catalog item. You can procure the asset by creating a service request. To learn more about how to create a service request, see [Create a service request to procure assets](create-service-request-procure-assets.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Network Inventory Workspace**.

2.  Select the list icon \(![List icon.](../image/ni-workspace-list-icon.png)\), and then go to **Inventory Models** &gt; **Equipment Models**.

    To publish an interface card, select **Interface Card Models**.

3.  From the list of records, select the inventory model record that you want.

4.  Select **Publish to Hardware Catalog**.

    If the inventory model is already added to the hardware catalog, the **Publish to Hardware Catalog** button doesn’t appear.

5.  In the **Category** field, select the hardware asset.

6.  Select **OK**.
