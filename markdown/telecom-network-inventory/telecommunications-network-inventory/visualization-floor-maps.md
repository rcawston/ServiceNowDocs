# Floor map

Use the floor map in the Telecommunications Network Inventory application to view a layout of your datacenter infrastructure. You can view the network assets placement and monitor the operational data on the map.

## Floor map overview

The floor map provides a visual representation of your datacenter floor. Use the floor map to view the layout of your datacenter infrastructure including network asset placement and operational details to monitor power, thermal, and usage data. You can view alerts, incidents, changes requests, and capacity information of the datacenter.

You can view the following information using the floor map.
