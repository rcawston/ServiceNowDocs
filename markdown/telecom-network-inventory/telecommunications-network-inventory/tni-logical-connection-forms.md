# Logical Connection form

The Logical Connection form enables you to define a logical connection by describing its configuration and connection details.

**Parent Topic:**[Telecommunications Network Inventory reference](telecommunications-network-inventory-reference.md)

## Logical Connection form

The Logical Connection form enables you to describe the details for a logical connection.

-   AMI \(Alternate Mark Inversion\) - A line coding scheme where zeros are represented by no voltage, and ones are represented by alternating positive and negative voltages.
-   B4ZS \(Bipolar with Four-Zero Substitution\) - A technique that replaces sequences of four consecutive zeros in a digital signal with a special pattern to maintain synchronization.
-   B8ZS \(Bipolar with Eight-Zero Substitution\) - Similar to B4ZS, but it replaces sequences of eight consecutive zeros with a special pattern to maintain synchronization in high-speed digital signals.
