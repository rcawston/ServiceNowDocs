# Import model excel template

Learn about the fields and structure of the Excel template used to define network element models and their hierarchical relationships for bulk import.

## Import model excel template overview

The import model template is a structured Excel file used to define network element models and their hierarchical relationships for bulk import into the application. Each row represents one record that is imported into the target system, and each column maps to a field in the target table. Entity ID uniquely identifies each row and acts as a key within the spreadsheet. It must be unique across all rows and is not mapped to any target table field. Parent entity ID and Root entity ID reference these keys to establish the parent-child hierarchy between components. The referenced Entity ID must already exist in the Entity ID column before it can be used as a parent or root reference. You do not need a separate row for the model relationship — the model and its relationship to the parent component can be defined in a single row. If the model already exists in the system, the record is skipped. If it does not exist, the model is created along with the model relationship. Model class determines the type of model being represented — Network Equipment Model, Network Holder Model, Network Card Model, or Network Interface Model. Model category must be a valid value from the model category table and determines which tables are used for inserting records and which tables are considered during equipment instantiation. The Excel template is created based on the Import model template \[sn\_ni\_adv\_import\_model\_template\] table. An admin can customize the template and update it as required. To download the template with sample data, select Create Excel template on the Import model request form. Only Sheet 1 is considered during import. All other sheets are ignored.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Count

</td><td>

The number of child elements of this type associated with the parent component.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Sequence

</td><td>

The order in which child elements are listed under the parent component.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Model category

</td><td>

The category of the model. Must be a valid value from the model category table. Determines which tables are used for inserting records and which tables are considered during equipment instantiation.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Slots occupied

</td><td>

The number of slots the component occupies in its parent holder.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Interface start number

</td><td>

The starting number used when auto-naming network interfaces associated with this component. Links the model to a corresponding catalog item in the application.
