# Create an inventory template for a logical composite

Create an inventory template for the logical composite in the Telecommunications Network Inventory application. You can use this template to instantiate a logical composite record and its related equipment and rack records.

## Use case

The following example shows an inventory template for a logical composite.

![Details view of a logical composite template with field information.](../image/logical-composite-template.png "Inventory template for a logical composite")

The inventory model has inventory relationships such as **Multi Chassis to Equipment** and **Multi Chassis to Rack** attached to it.

![Details of the network relationship with field information.](../image/logical-composite-model-relationship.png "Example of the network relationship")

After saving the inventory template, it creates the related equipment and rack templates depending on the count mentioned in the network model relationship.

The default naming patterns of slot, subslot, and port records that are created under the equipment are as follows:

|Inventory record|Naming pattern|
|----------------|--------------|
|Slot|"slot-”+"chassis\_position+”/“+position"|
|Subslot|"subslot-”+"chassis\_position+”/“+equipment\_slot\_position+”/“+position"|
|Port|"port-”+chassis\_position+”/“+equipment\_slot\_position+”/“+parent\_slot\_position+”/“+position"|

You can edit the **Name Pattern** field.
