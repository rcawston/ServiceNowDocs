# Modify the Design and Assign function layout

Modify the Design and Assign function layout in the Telecommunications Network Inventory application by configuring the endpoint. You can create the layout according to your network service requirement

## Before you begin

Role required: admin, sn\_ni\_core.inventory\_admin
