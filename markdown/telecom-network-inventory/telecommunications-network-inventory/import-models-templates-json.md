Create an import request to import your collection of models and templates in JSON format, and streamline the workflow using the Telecommunications Network Inventory application.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Network Inventory Workspace**.

2.  Select the list icon \(![List icon.](../image/ni-workspace-list-icon.png)\), and then go to **Import** &gt; **Imports**.

3.  Select **New**.

4.  On the Select an Import File Type window, select **Import Models and Templates \(JSON\)** from the list.

5.  On the **Details** tab, fill in the general information.

</table>6.  Download the demo data and model template by selecting **Create Excel Template**.

7.  Select **Import**.

    -   During the data import procedure:
        -   Integration Commons for CMDB: The plugin is automatically activated and by default. To learn more, see [Integration Commons for CMDB](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/cmdb-integration-commons/integration-commons-for-cmdb.md).
        -   Normalization Data Service Client \(Optional\): If installed and configured, the following normalization rules are applied.
            -   Removes special characters from the **Manufacturer** name.
            -   The new value is replaced if it matches with five characters of the existing value.
            -   Downloads standard and variant company names.
            -   Replaces company names with their standard equivalents. To learn more, see [Normalization data services](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/user-administration/c_NormalizationOverview.md). To customize the normalization rules, see [Normalized company names table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/user-administration/r_NormalizedCompanyNames.md).
    -   The generation of a record triggers its automatic addition to the **Import Results**. From this tab, you can see the import status and can select the generated model.
    -   A dedicated inventory template is generated for every rack/cabinet equipment holders, equipment models, and card models. Moreover, the related templates are generated based on the defined model relationship.
