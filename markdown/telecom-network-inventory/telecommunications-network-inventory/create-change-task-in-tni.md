    To learn more, see [Manually creating and reviewing your network asset instances](creating-telecommunications-network-inventory.md).

2.  Navigate to **Telecom Network Inventory** &gt; **Network Inventory Templates**, create the inventory templates for your equipment, and establish the template relationships.

    To learn more, see [Create inventory template for network asset instantiation](preparing-inv-templates-network-asset-generation.md).

## About this task

Based on the details in the change request form, a change task is created automatically. You can view, create, update, or close the change tasks from the **Overview** tab or from the **Change Tasks** tab of a change request. You can also assign a record producer form to a change task. To learn more, see [Assign a record producer form for a request type of a change task](assign_record_producer_form_for_a_change_task_of_a_change_request.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Network Inventory Workspace**.

2.  Select the list icon \(![List icon.](../image/ni-workspace-list-icon.png)\), and then go to **Changes** &gt; **All**.
