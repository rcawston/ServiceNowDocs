# Create a logical connection record using the Design and Assign function

Use the Design and Assign function to create a logical connection in the Telecommunications Network Inventory application. By creating a logical connection, you can fulfill the design request for a network service.

## Before you begin

Define the inventory records, models, model relationships, templates, and template relationships for your design criteria.

Role required: sn\_ni\_core.inventory\_agent, sn\_ni\_core.network\_planning\_manager

## About this task

The Design and Assign home page lists the change requests that are in the Design in progress state. You can either select a change request from the list or create a change request to design a logical connection depending on your requirement. Completion of each activity in the playbook for the Design and Assign function creates a change task for the next activity.

After you complete each activity, the network diagram updates and displays the data. You can review the network diagram for any incompleteness and update the activities accordingly.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Network Inventory Workspace**.

2.  Select the design and assign icon \(![Design and Assign Icon](../image/icon-design-assign.png)\).

    The Design and Assign home page is displayed.
