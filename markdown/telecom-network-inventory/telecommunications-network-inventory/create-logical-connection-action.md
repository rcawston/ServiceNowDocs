# Create Logical Connection function

The Create Logical Connection function enables you to create a logical connection record in the Telecommunications Network Inventory application based on the input \(interfaces\) that you receive when you instantiate an inventory.

You can use the Create Logical Connection function to create a logical connection on your network interface cards.

When you enter the Interface A, this function automatically retrieves the data for Site A, Equipment A, and Port A. Similarly, after passing input Interface Z, the function retrieves the data for the associated Site Z, Equipment Z, and Port Z. This function also retrieves the data for Bandwidth AtoZ and Bandwidth ZtoA from the Bandwidth field.

This function also creates the connection elements and associates them to the logical connection.

If you configure a network interface, equipment, physical connection, logical connection, or managed function as a connection element, the Logical Connection Creation function creates the corresponding connection element and associates it to a logical connection.

You can use this function as a Workflow Studio action in the Telecommunications Network Inventory workflow.

## Roles and availability

Users with the admin role can add an action to a flow and define the configuration details of the flow. This function is available as a Workflow Studio action in the Telecommunications Network Inventory application so that you can perform inventory-related data operations.
