## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Network Inventory Workspace**.

2.  Select the list icon \(![List icon.](../image/ni-workspace-list-icon.png)\), and then go to **Inventory Number Allocation** &gt; **Telephone Numbers**.

3.  Select **New**

4.  On the **Details** tab, in the telephone number section, fill in the fields.
