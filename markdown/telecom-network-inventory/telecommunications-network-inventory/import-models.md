Create an import model request to import your collection of models, and streamline the workflow using the Telecommunications Network Inventory application.

## Procedure

2.  Select the list icon \(![List icon.](../image/ni-workspace-list-icon.png)\), and then go to **Import** &gt; **Imports**.

3.  Select **New**.

4.  On the Select an Import File Type window, select **Import Models \(xls\)** from the list.

</table>6.  Download the demo data and model template by selecting **Create Excel Template**.

    -   The [Import model excel template](import-model-excel-template.md) is created based on the Import model template \[sn\_ni\_adv\_import\_model\_template\] table. An admin can customize the template and update it as required.
    -   The following relationship types are supported for import models.
        -   Equipment to slot
        -   Slot to card
        -   Equipment to network interface
        -   Card to network interface
        -   Rack/cabinet to rack/cabinet slot
        -   Rack/cabinet slot to equipment
7.  Select **Import**.

    -   During the data import procedure:
        -   Integration Commons for CMDB: The plugin is automatically activated and by default. To learn more, see [Integration Commons for CMDB](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/cmdb-integration-commons/integration-commons-for-cmdb.md).
        -   Normalization Data Service Client \(Optional\): If installed and configured, the following normalization rules are applied.
            -   Removes special characters from the **Manufacturer** name.
            -   The new value is replaced if it matches with five characters of the existing value.
            -   Downloads standard and variant company names.
            -   Replaces company names with their standard equivalents. To learn more, see [Normalization data services](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/user-administration/c_NormalizationOverview.md). To customize the normalization rules, see [Normalized company names table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/user-administration/r_NormalizedCompanyNames.md).
    -   The generation of a record triggers its automatic addition to the **Import Results**. From this tab, you can see the import status and can select the generated model.
    -   A dedicated inventory template is generated for every rack/cabinet equipment holders, equipment models, and card models. Moreover, the related templates are generated based on the defined model relationship.

## Result

The **Import Results** tab appears next to the **Details** tab where you can view, add, update, and delete the import set row.

## What to do next

-   Redirect to the generated model from **Import Results** tab.
-   Delete a record. To learn more, see [Delete a record](delete-inventory-record.md).
