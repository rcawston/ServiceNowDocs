# Define your inventory numbering

Define the numbering for your virtual local area network \(VLAN\) or link aggregation group \(LAG\) connections in the Telecommunications Network Inventory application. By defining these inventory numbers, you can configure your network assets to activate a network connection.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ni\_core.inventory\_admin, sn\_ni\_core.inventory\_agent, sn\_ni\_core.inventory\_template\_manager, sn\_ni\_core.telco\_inventory\_catalog\_manager

## About this task

The numbering that you define in this process creates VLAN and LAG number ranges, allowing for the assignment of numbers from those ranges to network connections and equipment ports. When you provision a network connection over an Ethernet network interface to fulfill a customer order, you create a VLAN interface to support your network topology. You must assign a VLAN number from 1 through 4096 for this interface. You use this VLAN number to create an interface name so that you can activate the interface on the network.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Network Inventory Workspace**.

2.  Select the list icon \(![List icon.](../image/ni-workspace-list-icon.png)\), and then go to **Inventory Number Allocation** &gt; **Inventory Numbers**.

3.  Select **New**.

4.  On the **Details** tab, fill in the general information for inventory numbering.
