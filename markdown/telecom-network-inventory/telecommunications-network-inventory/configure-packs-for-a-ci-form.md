# Configure an attribute pack table against a configuration item

Configure an attribute pack table against a configuration item \(CI\) with filter conditions in the Telecommunications Network Inventory application. As you configure the pack table, you can use the packs for creating a CI record.

## Before you begin

-   Make sure that the Attribute Pack plugin is installed with the Telecommunications Network Inventory application.
-   Create a pack table with a set of attributes. To learn more, see [Create table](create-pack-table.md).

Role required: admin, sn\_ni\_core.inventory\_admin

## About this task

To use a pack table in the inventory forms, you must configure it against a CI with filter conditions. If the CI is related to another CI, you must set the filter conditions to map the pack table against the related CI.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Pack Config**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  On the **Details** tab, fill in the fields.
