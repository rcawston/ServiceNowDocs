# Define the logical connection details

Review, update, or create a network asset instance for a logical or virtual port connection on your network interface cards. You define these attributes so that you can track and manage your network assets in the Telecommunications Network Inventory application.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ni\_core.inventory\_admin, sn\_ni\_core.inventory\_agent

## About this task

A logical connection typically represents the multiple physical connections on an interface card. The logical connection data includes the link types, bandwidths, port, and site.

When you create a logical connection record, it creates a corresponding configuration item \(CI\) record in the Logical Connection \[cmdb\_ci\_ni\_logical\_path\] table. To learn more, see [Data model](uses-for-network-inventory-data.md).

The **Overview** tab in the logical connection record displays a consolidated detail of the logical connection, its connection elements, and A and Z ends. You can customize the connection elements table by creating a custom implementation for the extension point `sn_ni_adv.TNIConnectionOverview`. Also, you can decide the number of rows in this table by setting the system property `sn_ni_adv.clr_max_rows`. The default value for this property is 500.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Network Inventory Workspace**.

2.  Select the list icon \(![List icon.](../image/ni-workspace-list-icon.png)\), and then select **Inventory** &gt; **Logical Connections**.

    **Note:** You can also access the logical connection list by selecting the **Logical connection** count in the Network entities. Logical connection count is under the categories widget of the Network Inventory Workspace landing page. To learn more, see [Reviewing and updating your network inventory with the Network Inventory Workspace](tni-workspace.md).

3.  Select **New**.

4.  On the **Details** tab, in the Logical Connection section, fill in the general information for the logical connection.

    To learn more about the fields that are unique to the Logical Connection form, see [Logical Connection form](tni-logical-connection-forms.md#).

    To learn about the remaining identification fields that are common to most of the Inventory and Inventory number allocation menu forms, see [Commonly used network asset instance identification fields](commonly-used-tni-identification-fields.md).

5.  On the **Details** tab, in the Configuration section, fill in the configuration information for the logical connection.

    To learn more about the fields that are unique to the Configuration section, see [Logical Connection form - Configuration](tni-logical-connection-forms.md#).

    To learn about the remaining configuration fields that are common to most of the Inventory menu forms, see [Commonly used network asset instance configuration fields](commonly-used-tni-configuration-fields.md).

6.  To create the Telecommunications Network Inventory attributes for the Logical Connection form, select **Set Inventory Attributes**.

    When you select the **Set Inventory Attributes** button, it creates the TNI CI Attributes record in the CI table as well as the Telecommunications Network Inventory CI Attributes tables and makes a relationship with the CI record.

    **Note:**

    If you select **Save** without selecting **Set Inventory Attributes**, it creates a CI record but not a Telecommunications Network Inventory CI record. In the network inventory workspace, the **Set Inventory Attributes** is visible only for the Telecommunications Network Inventory roles.

7.  On the TNI CI Attributes form, fill in the fields.

    To learn more about the Telecommunications Network Inventory attribute fields, see [TNI CI Attributes form](ci-attribue-form.md).

8.  Select **Save**.

    The Telecommunications Network Inventory attribute fields are displayed on the Logical Connection form after you save the TNI CI Attributes form. The **Set Inventory Attributes** doesn't appear when you reopen the CI record.

9.  To add the attachments, such as graphics or documents, select the attachment icon \(![Attachment icon.](../image/attachments-icon.png)\) in the right panel.

10. Select **Save**.

    The related tabs appear on the form. You can view or modify the related tab information. To learn more about the related tabs, see [Related tabs in the Network inventory forms](inventory-related-tab.md).

11. To view the visual representation of the selected record, select the more options icon \(![More Options icon.](../image/options-icon.png)\) and then select **Open Map**.

    **Note:** Install CMDB Workspace 3.5.0 orService Graph Workspace greater version to get this button in your instance. To learn more, see [CMDB Workspace or Service Graph Workspace](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/c8ab76825371201032b7ddeeff7b1280/3.5.0).

12. Select the more options icon \(![More Options icon.](../image/options-icon.png)\) and then select **Add Packs** to capture the attributes for a configuration item \(CI\) record.

    To learn more, see [Attribute pack for CI records](using-pack-table-ci-record.md).

13. Select the more options icon \(![More Options icon.](../image/options-icon.png)\) and then select **Decommission** to decommission a CI record.

    To learn more, see [Decommission an inventory record](decommision-an-inventory-record.md).

14. To view the associated network inventories, select the brick icon \(![Brick icon.](../image/infrastructure-relashionship.png)\).

    The Infrastructure Relationships section shows all the associated network inventories grouped by the individual network asset instances.


## What to do next

-   If you want to establish relationships with the other network assets, enter the details in the related tabs. To learn more, see [Related tabs in the Network inventory forms](inventory-related-tab.md).

-   To delete an inventory record, see [Delete a record](delete-inventory-record.md).
