# Design your GPON Broadband Service

Design and assign your Gigabyte Passive Optical Network \(GPON\) broadband service in the Telecommunications Network Inventory application. The GPON Broadband Service change model enables you to create multiple change tasks so that you can fulfill an order request for a GPON broadband service.

## Before you begin

Before you can establish a GPON Broadband Service change request and complete the related change tasks, your inventory catalog and template managers must do the following network configuration setup:

1.  Navigate to **Telecom Network Inventory** &gt; **Inventory Models**, create your inventory models, and define their relationships.

    To learn more, see [Manually creating and reviewing your network asset instances](creating-telecommunications-network-inventory.md).

2.  Navigate to **Telecom Network Inventory** &gt; **Network Inventory Templates**, create the inventory templates for your equipment, and establish the template relationships.

    To learn more, see [Create inventory template for network asset instantiation](preparing-inv-templates-network-asset-generation.md).


Install the Telecommunications Network Inventory Advanced and Core demo data.

Role required: sn\_ni\_core.inventory\_admin, sn\_ni\_core.inventory\_agent

7.  Open and review each change task record.

    On the Task Attributes form, fill in the fields. For a description of the field values, see [Change request and change task forms](change_request_forms.md).
