# Create inventory models

As an inventory catalog manager, you can use a series of forms to define the metadata for each network model in the Telecommunications Network Inventory. During this process, you also specify the relationships between each of these models.

## Inventory models overview

The metadata that you define in an inventory model serves an important purpose when you create an associated template or instantiate an instance of equipment. It ensures that you adhere to the validations put in place by the equipment vendor so that you don’t create a non-supported piece of equipment.

-   The metadata that the inventory models contain, such as the name, model number, height, and depth, remain consistent across all individual instances of that particular type of equipment.
-   When you generate the equipment instances for an inventory model, they all contain this standard manufacturer information.

**Note:** To learn more about creating templates and generating network assets from your model and template records, see

-   [Create inventory template for network asset instantiation](preparing-inv-templates-network-asset-generation.md)
-   [Instantiating your network inventory by using design and assign](instantiate-asset-using-template-relationship-model.md)

To create a comprehensive digital model of your telecommunications network, do the following tasks:

1.  In the Equipment Model form, create inventory models for your telecommunications equipment.
    -   Creating an equipment inventory model is the first requirement for setting up the process to generate network asset instances when using inventory templates.
    -   You create an equipment model record every time a vendor or original equipment manufacturer \(OEM\) introduces new equipment for your use. To learn more, see [Create an equipment model](create-equipment-models.md).
2.  In the Equipment Holder Model form, create the inventory model records for your equipment holders. To learn more, see [Create an equipment holder model](create-equipment-holder-models.md).
3.  In the Network Interface Model form, create the inventory model records for your network interfaces. To learn more, see [Create a card model](create-interface-card-models.md).
4.  In the Interface Cards Model form, create the inventory model records for your network interface cards. To learn more, see [Create a network interface model](create-network-interface-model.md).
5.  In the Physical Connection Model form, create the inventory model records for each physical or wired connection. To learn more, see [Create a physical connection model](create-physical-connection-models.md).
6.  In the Logical Connection Model form, create inventory model records for each logical connection. To learn more, see [Create a logical connection model](create-logical-connection-models.md).
7.  In the Network Model Relationship form, define the relationships between each model record in your network inventory. To learn more, see [Define a network model relationship](create-network-model-relationships.md).

## Inventory model related tabs

After you create inventory models, the information in the following table appears on these tabs in each inventory model record.
