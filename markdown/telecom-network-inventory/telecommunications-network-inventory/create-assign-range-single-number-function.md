# Create and Assign Range/Single Number function

The Create and Assign Range/Single Number function enables you to create the inventory number records for a number range when you process the network inventory workflow.

You use the Create and Assign Range/Single Number function to create the inventory number records between the input start and end numbers. This function also creates the corresponding number elements.

You can use this function as a Workflow Studio action in the Telecommunications Network Inventory workflow.

## Roles and availability

## Output

The following table lists the information about the function output.

|Name|Description|Type|
|----|-----------|----|
|Inventory Number|Returns the inventory number record.|Record|

## Example

Consider, a VLAN has 1–4096 as range and 1–1000, 1001–2500, and 2510–4096 are the subranges. If you give the start number as 2501 and the end number as 2502, the function creates a number range of 2501-2502 and returns the inventory number record.
