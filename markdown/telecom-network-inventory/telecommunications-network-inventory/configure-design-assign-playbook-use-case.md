# Configure a Design and Assign function example

This example demonstrates how you can create and configure a playbook to design and assign a network service in the Telecommunications Network Inventory application.

## Example overview

Consider you have an order requests from a customer to fulfill a network service that must create Optical Network Terminals \(ONT\) for a specified location. To design and assign this network service, you must capture the ONT details such as an ONT site and equipment template details. By creating and configuring a playbook for the Design and Assign function, you can automate these tasks by following step-by-step guidance for designing the network service.

As a playbook admin, you create and configure the playbook to design and assign your inventory for the network service. The playbook contains the following activities to create the ONT device.

1.  Setup Network Service - Collects service details of your design request.
2.  Capture ONT Details - Capture the ONT site and inventory template details to instantiate the equipment.
3.  Review and Submit - You review the activity details and creates the ONT devices for the specific location according to the template.

As a part of this playbook workflow, you automate the following.

-   Creates a change request for the ONT design.
-   Creates change tasks for the activities such as capturing ONT details.
-   Execute the change tasks to instantiate the equipment using an inventory template.

As a playbook agent, you can fulfill your customer orders and requests for the network service by using this Design and Assign function.

## Prerequisites

Prior to creating a playbook, as an inventory core admin, you create and configure the following.

1.  Create a Change model and add model states.

<table id="table_mqg_b1g_tdc"><thead><tr><th>

Item

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Change model name

</td><td>

Set name as **Network Service Automated Flow**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Model state

</td><td>

Add the following model states and set the model state transitions.-   **Design in progress**

Set model state transition to **Design complete**.

-   **Design complete**

Set model state transition to **Closed**.

-   **Closed**

Don't set any model state transition for this state.

**Note:** You must add Allow CI Modification attribute to the **Design in progress** and **Design complete** model states.

</td></tr></tbody>

2.  Create a record producer to capture the ONT input details such as ONT site and inventory template. This record producer is used in the second activity in the playbook.

<table id="table_qtd_lfg_tdc"><thead><tr><th>

## Adding playbook to home page

You add the sys\_id of the Network Service Automated Flow Change model in the `sn_ni_ws.tni_design_assign_chg_models` record. To learn more about the detailed steps, see [Update system property to configure the Design and Assign home page](update-system-property-configure-design-assign-home-page.md).

## Using a Design and Assign function

As an agent, you use the playbook for the Design and Assign function to fulfill the requirement of the network service by following the steps.

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Network Inventory Workspace**.
2.  Select the design and assign icon \(![Design and Assign Icon](../image/icon-design-assign.png)\) to open the Design and Assign home page.
3.  On the Design Assign home page, select **New** &gt; **Network Service Automated Flow**.
4.  Complete the activities on the playbook to design and assign your network service.

This process creates an ONT device based on the template and site that you selected in the playbook activity.

The following example is the Design and Assign function that you created.
