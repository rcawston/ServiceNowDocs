# Customize overlay time series on the floor map

Update the decision table to configure the time duration option on the floor map. You can view the operational data of the datacenters for a selected time range as overlay on the floor map in the Telecommunications Network Inventory application.

## About this task

You can modify the time duration option on the floor map by configuring the **TNI Data Center Time Duration Configuration** decision table. The operational data for the time series you selected appears as a colored layer on the floor map.

For the time duration configuration, if the time value is set to one second, the latest metric value is retrieved from the ClothoDB. For all other time durations, the system returns the average metric value over the specified duration.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Definition** &gt; **Decision Tables**.

2.  Select the **TNI Data Center Time Duration Configuration** decision table.

3.  Select **Create Draft**.

4.  Do one of the following.
