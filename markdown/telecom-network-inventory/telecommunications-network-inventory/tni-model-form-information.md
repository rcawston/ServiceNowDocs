Slot naming pattern

</td><td>

Name patterns that are used to define the names that are generated for the slots and interfaces that are on the equipment or card. Because these name patterns are at the model level, they’re applied by default to every template of that model. These name patterns are editable for the different instances of the same model. To learn more about the naming convention, see [Naming convention for associated templates](name-convention-templates.md).

 Although the names are generated automatically, you can manually edit the names of the templates.

 **Note:**

1.  This field is applicable for the equipment models and the interface card models.
2.  The generated name remains empty if the following occurs:
    -   The variable names are misspelled.
    -   You use the parent\_slot or equipment\_slot information for the interfaces or slots that are in the equipment.
3.  If this field is left empty, then the default naming pattern is considered. Here, the default naming is Slot-001, where 001 is the slot start number.

This field is applicable for the equipment models and the interface card models.
