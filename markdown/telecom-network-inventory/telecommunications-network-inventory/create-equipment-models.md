# Create an equipment model

Create an equipment model in the Telecommunications Network Inventory application as the first requirement for setting up the process to generate your network asset instances. You create an equipment model record every time a vendor or original equipment manufacturer \(OEM\) introduces new equipment for your use.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ni\_core.inventory\_admin, sn\_ni\_core.telco\_inventory\_catalog\_manager

## About this task

An equipment model represents the metadata that is provided by a vendor or manufacturer for the equipment. It defines the consistent characteristics across the various instances that are created for the equipment. An instance is an individual occurrence of a network asset at a site or datacenter. With this application, you define the physical characteristics data of the network equipment per the product manufacturer's recommendations. When you create an equipment model record, it creates the model record in the Equipment Model \[sn\_ent\_nw\_equipment\_model\] table.
