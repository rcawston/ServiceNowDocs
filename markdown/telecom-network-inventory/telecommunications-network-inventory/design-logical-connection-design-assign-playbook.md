# Logical connections

Design and assign a logical connection in the Telecommunications Network Inventory application. By using the Design and Assign function, you can fulfill the logical connection design request of a customer.

The Design and Assign function provides the activities and tasks that an agent can perform to create a logical connection. Depending on the design request, the agent can design a logical connection and assign the related network inventories to that connection.

## Design and Assign function layout and features

The following example shows the Design and Assign function layout for a logical connection.

The activity picker displays the list of activities to design and assign a logical connection. Each activity has an indicator that shows the activity state:-   ![Activity In progress Icon](../image/icon-activity-progress.png) - Activity is work in progress.
-   ![Activity Complete Icon](../image/icon-activity-complete.png) - Activity is completed.
-   ![Activity Pending Icon](../image/icon-activity-pending.png) - Pending activities.
-   ![Activity Skipped Icon](../image/icon-activity-skip.png) - Activity is skipped.

Select an activity to view the details in the activity viewer.

Activity cards display the details about the current activity in the activity viewer. Depending on the type of activity, the activity cards can display information such as field information to set up an end point.Agents use the cards to complete the work for each activity, such as adding end points or setting attributes.

Network diagram graphically displays a circuit of the logical connection elements. After you complete each activity, the network diagram updates and displays the data. You get a clear visualization of your design.You can expand the network diagram by collapsing the activity picker and activity details panels.

You can expand the pills in the diagram to see all underlying connection elements. Hover over each pill show the full name of that connection element.

</table>## Design and Assign workflow for logical connection

The Design and Assign function for a logical connection has the following workflow.

1.  Create a change request and add necessary details about your design.
2.  Provide connection details which influence the design such as logical connection model, bandwidth, and domain.
3.  Select end points such as network sites and interfaces where the connection starts and terminates.
4.  Select connection elements between the endpoints.
5.  Select a protection path to define the redundancy path for your logical connection.
6.  Select a number element such as VLAN or LAG.
7.  Select an IP address.
8.  Review the design and submit for approval.

By completing these steps, a logical connection record is generated with the associated Configuration Items \(CI\).

To learn more about the steps to design and assign a logical connection, see [Create a logical connection record using the Design and Assign function](create-logical-connection-record-design-assign-playbook.md).
