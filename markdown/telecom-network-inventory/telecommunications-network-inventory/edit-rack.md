3.  Select a rack from the displayed list.

    After selecting a KPI \(Key Performance Indicator\), a list of the equipment contributing to that respective metric is displayed.

4.  Select **Edit Rack**.

    A list of all equipment, and the front view of both the edited configuration and the current configuration is displayed.

5.  From the displayed list of equipment, search for the equipment to add in the rack by using either the filters or the search box.

    **Note:**

    -   The existing filters automatically clear on entering a search. And, applying a filter clears your search terms.
    -   The equipment list can also be sorted based on latest creation date, highest number of Rack Units and weight.
    -   The list shows all the equipment records included in the sn\_ni\_core.equipment system property, and the equipment that aren't in the rack. However, the equipment installed within the rack is visible in the list, but remains inactive.
    -   The info \(![info icon](../image/icon-info.png)\) expands and displays the equipment details on selecting an equipment or the info button.
