# Create an IP pool record

Create an IP pool record so that you can organize and categorize all your sequential IP addresses within a network. You can create an IP pool record by using the Telecommunications Network Inventory application.

## Before you begin

-   Get access to the IP subnetwork by ensuring that you’ve installed all advanced plugins.
-   Role required: sn\_ni\_core.inventory\_admin, sn\_ni\_core.inventory\_agent

## About this task

You can review, create, or delete an IP pool in your network.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Network Inventory Workspace**.

2.  Select the list icon \(![List icon.](../image/ni-workspace-list-icon.png)\), and then go to **Inventory Number Allocation** &gt; **IP Pools**.

3.  Select **New**

4.  On the **Details** tab, in the IP address section, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Name|User-friendly name for this IP pool.|

    To learn about the other fields, see [Inventory number allocation fields](inventory-number-allocation-fields.md).

5.  Create the Telecommunications Network Inventory attributes for this IP pool form by selecting the **Set Inventory Attributes** button.

    When you select the **Set Inventory Attributes** button, it creates the TNI CI Attributes record in the CI table and in the Telecommunications Network Inventory CI Attributes tables and makes a relationship with the CI record.

    **Note:**

    -   If you select **Save** without selecting **Set Inventory Attributes**, it creates a CI record but not a Telecommunications Network Inventory CI record. In the network inventory workspace, the **Set Inventory Attributes** is visible only for the Telecommunications Network Inventory roles.
    -   In the TNI CI attributes form, by default, the name is fetched from the **Name** field and the **Inventory Category** is set as **IP Address**.
6.  Add packs to this service by selecting **Add Packs**.

    To learn more about the packs, see [Attribute packs](telecommunication-network-inventory-pack.md).

7.  Add the attachments, such as the graphics or documents, by selecting the attachment icon \(![Attachment icon.](../image/attachments-icon.png)\) in the right panel.

8.  Select **Save**.

    The related tabs appear on the form. To learn more, see [Related tabs in the Network inventory forms](inventory-related-tab.md).

9.  View the hierarchy or flow chart of the created IP pool by selecting the **Dependency View** button.

10. View the related network inventories by selecting the brick icon \(![brick icon.](../image/infrastructure-relashionship.png)\).

    The Infrastructure Relationships section shows all the related network inventories that are grouped by the individual network instance.


## What to do next

You can review and update the fields, create a related tab record, or delete a record. To learn more, see [Update or delete a record of an inventory number allocation](update_and_delete_ip_address_space.md).
