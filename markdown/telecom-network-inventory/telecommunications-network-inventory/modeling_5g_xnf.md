# Model 5G network function

You can model your 5G network and manage your any type of network functions by using the Telecommunications Network Inventory application. By using the model, you can create, review, update, and delete your networks.

## 5G network model

You must create a business application, an application service, and network interfaces to model your 5G network as shown in the following diagram.

-   Business Application: The business application table stores all network functions. The business application records the labels of all classes proposed by 3GPPTM\* as a type of managed network function. To learn more, see [Define the network function details](create_business_applications.md).
-   Application Service: The application service stores the instance of the corresponding network function, which is associated with the business applications to indicate its type, such as DU or CU-CP and so on. Each instance of a function has a record in the application service. You can create a relationship with a business application and network interface. To learn more, see [Define the network service instance details](create_application_services.md).
-   Network Interface: The network interface stores all the logical IP interfaces that are assigned to the managed network. The logical interfaces represent a peer-to-peer relationship. If there’s a connection between a distributed unit \(DU\) and centralized unit \(CU\) control plane or user plane \(UP\) functions, a logical connection is created between the logical interfaces. By using the relationship editor, you can create a relationship with an application service. To learn more, see [Define the network interface details](define-tni-interfaces.md) and [CI relationship editor](https://servicenow.com/docs/bundle/utah-servicenow-platform/page/product/configuration-management/concept/c_RelationshipEditor.html) to create or edit a relationship.
