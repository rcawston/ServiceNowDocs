# Create a telephone number allocation

Create a telephone number allocation so that you can group a set of telephone numbers and apply the required conditions to it by using the Telecommunications Network Inventory application. You can also review, create, update, or delete a telephone number allocation.

## Before you begin

-   Ensure that the Telecommunications Network Inventory application includes all the required components of your telephone number. Otherwise, see [Create the components of a telephone number](create_components_of_a_telephone_number.md).
-   Role required: sn\_inv\_num\_mgmt.inventory\_number\_manager

## About this task

Setting the Create telephone allocations and numbers checkbox as true, while creating a telephone block, creates individual numbers and telephone allocation. You can assign multiple telephone numbers to a telephone allocation. When you assign a single telephone number allocation to a telephone number block, you can assign a series of numbers to that block.

On completing this task, assigning a single telephone number allocation to a telephone number block results in assigning a series of numbers to that block.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Network Inventory Workspace**.

2.  Select the list icon \(![List icon.](../image/ni-workspace-list-icon.png)\), and then go to **Inventory Number Allocation** &gt; **Telephone Number**.

3.  Select **New**.

4.  On the **Details** tab, on the IP address section form, fill in the fields.

5.  Add the attachments, such as the graphics or documents, by selecting the attachment icon \(![Attachment icon.](../image/attachments-icon.png)\) in the right panel.

6.  Select **Save**.

    The related tabs appear on the form. You can view or change the related tab information. To learn more about the related tabs, see [Related tabs in the Network inventory forms](inventory-related-tab.md).

    **Note:** Based on the assigned or allocated telephone numbers, the existing allocation divides into separate allocations. For example, in a series of 1-100, if 1-10 and 90–100 are assigned, then the 1–100 allocation divides into three allocations. The three allocations, 1–10 and 90–100 with availability as No and 11–89 as Yes are created.
