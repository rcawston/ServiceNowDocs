# Create capacity function

Create a capacity function in the Telecommunications Network Inventory application. You can use this function to calculate the capacity of your network assets.

## Before you begin

Make sure that the Capacity Management plugin is installed with the Telecommunications Network Inventory application.

Role required: sn\_ni\_core.inventory\_admin

## About this task

Create a capacity function to calculate the maximum, occupied, and available capacity of your network assets. You can use different strategies to calculate the capacity. When you create a capacity function, it stores the record in the Capacity Function \[sn\_cap\_mgmt\_function\] table.

The system selects the capacity functions based on their priority to calculate the capacity. The following points are considered to set the priority for capacity calculations.

-   If two capacity functions have same Function type and Measurement type, the one with the lowest Order value gets prioritized.
-   If two capacity functions have same Function type, Measurement type, and Order, the one that was most recently updated is given priority.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Capacity Management** &gt; **Functions**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    To learn more about the fields, see [Capacity Function form](capacity-function-form.md).

4.  Select **Submit**.


## Result

The capacity function record is created.

## What to do next

You can use the function for capacity calculation or use it within the definition record to determine the capacity. To learn more about how to create a capacity definition, see [Create capacity definition](create-capacity-definition.md).
