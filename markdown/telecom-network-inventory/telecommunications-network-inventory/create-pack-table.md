# Create table

Create an attribute pack table with the attributes that you define in the Telecommunications Network Inventory application so that you can use these attributes in the CI record.

## Before you begin

-   Make sure that the Attribute Pack plugin is installed with the Telecommunications Network Inventory application.
-   Switch the Application scope to Attribute Pack.

Role required: admin, sn\_ni\_core.inventory\_admin

## About this task

Create an attribute pack table with attributes by extending the Pack Base \(sn\_attribute\_pack\_base\) table. You define and store the attributes in the Pack base table. You can enable read or write permission for all application scopes.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Definition** &gt; **Tables**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Value|
    |-----|-----|
    |Label|Name of the pack table.|
    |Name|Auto-populated name that is based on the label name that you selected \(sn\_attribute\_pack\_&lt;label name&gt;\).|
    |Extends table|Pack \(sn\_attribute\_pack\_base\)|

4.  On the **Controls** tab, add the roles in the **User Role** field.

    You add the roles to grant the access to the pack table.

5.  Select **Save**.

6.  Add or delete attributes.

7.  Select **Submit**.


## Result

The pack table is created with a set of attributes.

## What to do next

To use the pack table in inventory forms, you must configure it to map with the inventory objects. To learn more, see [Configure an attribute pack table against a configuration item](configure-packs-for-a-ci-form.md).
