Request type

</td><td>

Request type. Depending on your selection, the record producer form under the task attributes gets updated. This field represents the type of change request. Select any one of the following:-   **Revise CI**

This type of request definition enables you to select a CI that you want to revise and clones the selected CI details and related items. The **Configuration item** field is automatically updated with the cloned CI name having suffix as revised.

All the changes made to the CI are now applied to the cloned CI. Also, both original and duplicated CIs can be found under **Affected CIs** tab. To customize the cloning process, see [../task/clone-and-revise-a-ci.md](../task/clone-and-revise-a-ci.md).

-   **Add cable**

This type of request definition enables you to create a cable record.

-   **Add Card**

This type of request definition enables you to select a site and equipment model when you add interface cards. To learn more about equipment instantiation, see [Design and assign](telecommunications-circuit-design-resource-assignment.md).

-   **Create equipment**

This type of request definition enables you to select a network site and an inventory template for equipment instantiation. If you want to place your equipment inside a rack, you can select an equipment holder.

-   **Create Physical Connection and Create Logical Connection**

These types of request definitions have similar sets of site and equipment selection fields for the physical or logical connections between your start \(A\) and end \(Z\) locations. You can only select those interfaces that are associated with the designated equipment model for the A-start and Z-end interfaces.

For the instantiation of physical or logical connections, you must select a physical connection model or a logical connection model, depending on the type of connection that you want to create between the two sites. For a logical connection, this internal code creates a CI record, and additional path elements.

-   **Logical connection - Path compute**

This type of request definition has a set of site and equipment fields for start and end locations.

For initiation of the path compute of the logical connection, you must select logical connection model. To learn more, see [Compute and Create Logical Connection form](compute-and-create-logical-connection-form.md).

-   **Modify members of a topology**

This type of request definition enables you to create a cable record. o learn more about modifying a network topology record, see [Add or remove a member to network topology record](modify-network-topology-record-design-assign.md).

-   **IP Address Allocation**

This type of request definition enables you to instantiate an IP address allocation and assign new services to the IP addresses. To learn more, see IP address allocation form in [Change request and change task forms](change_request_forms.md).

-   **Phone Number Allocation**

This type of request definition enables you to instantiate a phone number allocation. You can allocate, de-allocate, and create numbers that are provided externally. To learn more, see the Manage phone number form in [Change request and change task forms](change_request_forms.md).
