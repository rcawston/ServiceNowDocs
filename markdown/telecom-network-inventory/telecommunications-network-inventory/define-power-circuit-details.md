# Define the power circuit details

Define the power circuit record to represent the electrical pathway that delivers power in a datacenter. By defining the power circuit records, you can track and manage your network assets in the Telecommunications Network Inventory application.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ni\_core.inventory\_admin, sn\_ni\_core.inventory\_agent

## About this task

When you create a power circuit connection record, it creates a corresponding configuration item \(CI\) record in the circuit \[cmdb\_ci\_circuit\] table. To learn more, see [Data model](uses-for-network-inventory-data.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Network Inventory Workspace**.

2.  Select the list icon \(![List icon.](../image/ni-workspace-list-icon.png)\), and then select **Inventory** &gt; **Power Circuits**.

3.  Select **New**.

4.  On the **Details** tab, in the Circuit section, fill in the fields.

    To learn more about the fields, see [Power circuit form](power-circuit-form.md).

5.  On the **Details** tab, in the Configuration section, fill in the configuration information for the power circuit.

    To learn about the configuration fields, see [Commonly used network asset instance configuration fields](commonly-used-tni-configuration-fields.md).

6.  To create the Telecommunications Network Inventory attributes for the Power Circuit form, select **Set Inventory Attributes**.

    When you select the **Set Inventory Attributes** button, it creates the TNI CI Attributes record in the CI table as well as the Telecommunications Network Inventory CI Attributes tables and makes a relationship with the CI record.

    **Note:**

    If you select **Save** without selecting **Set Inventory Attributes**, it creates a CI record but not a Telecommunications Network Inventory CI record. In the network inventory workspace, the **Set Inventory Attributes** is visible only for the Telecommunications Network Inventory roles.

7.  On the TNI CI Attributes form, fill in the fields.

    To learn more about the Telecommunications Network Inventory attribute fields, see [TNI CI Attributes form](ci-attribue-form.md).

8.  Select **Save**.

    The Telecommunications Network Inventory attribute fields are displayed on the Power Circuit form after you save the TNI CI Attributes form. The **Set Inventory Attributes** doesn't appear when you reopen the CI record.

9.  To add the attachments, such as graphics or documents, select the attachment icon \(![Attachment icon.](../image/attachments-icon.png)\).

10. Select **Save**.

    The related tabs appear on the form. You can view or modify the related tab information. To learn more about the related tabs, see [Related tabs in the Network inventory forms](inventory-related-tab.md).

11. To view the associated network inventories, select the brick icon \(![Brick icon.](../image/infrastructure-relashionship.png)\).

    The Infrastructure Relationships section shows all the associated network inventories grouped by the individual network asset instances.


## What to do next

If you want to establish relationships with the other network assets, enter the details in the related tabs. To learn more, see [Related tabs in the Network inventory forms](inventory-related-tab.md).
