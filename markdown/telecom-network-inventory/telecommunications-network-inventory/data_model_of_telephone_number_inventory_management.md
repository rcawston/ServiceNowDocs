# Telephone number inventory management data model

By using the telephone number inventory management data model, you can understand how the tables of a telephone block, telephone number allocation, and telephone number relate to each other.

The following diagram shows the telephone number inventory management data model.![Data model that explains how the tables of a telephone number block, telephone number allocation, and telephone number are related.](../image/telephone_datamodel.png)

The data model provides an overview of telephone number usage and availability. With this data model, you can store the telephone block, allocation, and telephone number.

**Note:** You can also allocate or deallocate a telephone number for a customer service. You must create a telephone block for the telephone number block table.

A telephone number is assigned this way:

1.  A telephone number inventory manager creates a telephone number block to store all the different types of telephone numbers. The numbers can be categorized based on the area, country, port-in type, or port-out type. Each record of the block is stored in the table of the telephone number block.
2.  A telephone number inventory manager then creates a telephone allocation to assign a service to a series or to a set of numbers. A telephone block can have a group as its child. These allocations are created in the telephone number allocation table.
3.  The telephone number allocation table relates the telephone numbers that are ready to use to a record in the telephone number table.
