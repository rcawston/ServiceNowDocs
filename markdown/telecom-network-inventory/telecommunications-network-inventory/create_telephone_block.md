-   Role required: sn\_inv\_num\_mgmt.inventory\_number\_manager

## About this task

You can create multiple telephone number allocations and telephone numbers for one telephone block. Also, you can also review, create, update, or delete a telephone block.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Network Inventory Workspace**.

2.  Select the list icon \(![List icon.](../image/ni-workspace-list-icon.png)\), and then go to **Inventory Number Allocation** &gt; **Telephone Blocks**.

3.  Select **New**.

    **Note:** You can create and allocate telephone numbers without using a block for the port-in numbers or for the numbers that don’t want a block.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_mzv_1nt_mxb"><thead><tr><th>

Fields

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

</td><td>

By default, the field is set as true. The result is that the individual telephone numbers and telephone number allocations are created using the provided from and to number. When you clear this check box, only a telephone block is created.**Note:**

1.  The created number of allocations and the telephone numbers are shown as available to allocate.
2.  By default, the status of the created numbers is set as new.


</td></tr><tr><td>

</td><td>

Starting number of the series from where you want to start adding numbers to this block.

</td></tr><tr><td>

To number

</td><td>

Last number of the series where you want to stop adding numbers to this block.**Note:** The same or overlapping series of numbers aren’t enabled to include in a block. For example, if a block 100–200 exists, then the new block of 150-200 or 100–200 can’t be enabled.
