Key Management

</td><td>

-   In pre-Zurich releases, the GlideEncrypter API used the three-key Triple Data Encryption Standard \(3DES\) encryption standard, which [NIST 800-131A Rev 2](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-131Ar2.pdf) has recommended against using after 2023. The following changes are taking place in the Australia release in preparation for a full deprecation of GlideEncrypter/3DES in the future:
    -   New Australia instances can’t use GlideEncrypter. All base system scripts have been changed to use alternative encryption processes.
    -   if you’re upgrading your Australia instances, you can still GlideEncrypter, which has been updated to use AES256-GCM encryption via the Key Management Framework.
    -   Learn more about 3DES deprecation in [KB1704481](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1704481).

MID Server

</td><td>

For the latest MID Server system requirements, see [MID Server system requirements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/mid-server/r_MIDServerSystemRequirements.md). The minimum JRE version supported is 17.0.10 and the recommended version is 21.0.7.

If you have installed your own JRE, the upgrade process takes the following actions to verify that the MID Server uses a supported JRE:

-   If a MID Server is using an unsupported version of the JRE when it upgrades, the upgrade process displays a warning message with the minimum and recommended JRE version.
-   If a supported JRE is running on the MID Server host, the upgraded MID Server uses that version.

All MID Server host machines require access to the download site at `install.service-now.com` to enable auto-upgrades. For additional details, read how the system manages [MID Server upgrades](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/mid-server/c_UpgradeAndTestMIDServer.md).

Only one Windows MID Server service is permitted according to the executable path. Upgraded Windows MID Servers that have multiple services pointing to the same installation folder can’t start. See [MID Server fails to start](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/mid-server/mid-startup-fails.md) for more information.

For more information about MID Server upgrades, see the following topics:

-   [MID Server pre-upgrade check](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/mid-server/c_UpgradeAndTestMIDServer.md): Describes how the AutoUpgrade monitor tests the ability of the MID Server to upgrade on your system before the actual upgrade.
-   [Upgrade the MID Server manually](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/mid-server/c_UpgradeAndTestMIDServer.md): Describes how to upgrade your MID Servers manually.

For more information, see [Download the RPA applications from RPA Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/download-installer-rpa.md).

The following upgrade information is applicable only when you’re upgrading from San Diego or Tokyo to Australia.

Based on the number of records in the application file table, you may experience a delay while upgrading the RPA Hub applications from Tokyo or earlier releases to Australia.

Before upgrading RPA Hub to Australia, you must set the value of the **glide.rollback.blacklist.TableParentChange.change** system property to **false**. If this property doesn't exist in the System Property \[sys\_properties\] table, add the property and set its value to false. For more information on how to add a property, see [Add a system property](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/r_AvailableSystemProperties.md).

After you upgrade to Australia, the bot process definitions change to the new structure, which is the bot process configuration.

Although the bot process configuration doesn't replace the bot process completely, most fields are moved from the bot process to the bot process configuration. If you upgrade to Australia without updating the system property value, the tables don’t extend the Application File \[sys\_metadata\] table. To update the table changes manually, see the [Restructuring RPA Hub tables to sys\_metadata in Utah and beyond release \[KB1223629\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1223629) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

Service Exchange \(formerly Service Bridge\)

</td><td>

**Important:** Do not upgrade your ServiceNow® instance to the Australia release if you rely on Service Exchange. A known RPS issue prevents Service Exchange from functioning correctly. Proceed with the upgrade only after Australia Patch 1 becomes available.

-   Service Exchange version 2.x.x, which was first released with the Xanadu release, doesn’t support migration of Service Exchange \(Legacy\) versions.

Service Exchange \(Legacy\) version: Before you upgrade to the Australia release, consult the [Service Exchange for Providers \(Legacy\) - Migration Utility \[KB1499823\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1499823) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base to find out how to migrate your configuration data.

-   Service Exchange version 1.x.x: When upgrading, consult the [Upgrade Guide - Service Exchange for Providers and Consumers application \(v2.x.x release\) \[KB1700387\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1700387) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base to find out how to migrate your Service Exchange applications.
-   Service Exchange version 2.x.x: New entitlements that require the latest compatibility version cannot be activated until both consumers and providers upgrade to Service Exchange version 2.x.x. New entitlements configured with a lower compatibility version can be activated. Older active entitlements continue to work but new ones can’t be activated.
-   When using Service Exchange for Providers and Service Exchange for Consumers in a single instance, you must upgrade both applications simultaneously to the same version to maintain compatibility. If the versions diverge, a scan check will report version mismatches and the Health Dashboard will show a version mismatch issue. After upgrading, run and validate the post‑upgrade scan suite to identify and resolve any post‑upgrade issues.
-   If you have upgraded to Service Exchange version 2.0.55 before upgrading the platform to the Australia release and your instance has Sales Customer Relationship Management plug-in version 1.0.4 installed, the new Deny ACLs aren't installed. After upgrading to the Australia release, select Repair to reinstall the Service Exchange application to ensure Deny ACLs are installed.
-   When you install the Service Exchange application, the Service Exchange Global script include is automatically installed or updated on the following platform versions:
    -   Yokohama
    -   Zurich
    -   Australia

ServiceNow AI Platform core feature

</td><td>

The dynamic schema application framework was revised in the Zurich release. If you implemented dynamic schema in the Xanadu or Yokohama releases, the application is automatically migrated to a new framework as part of the upgrade to releases starting with the Zurich release. For details on the migration and steps you might need to perform, see the [Dynamic Schema Zurich Migration Guide \[KB2146133\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2146133) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

The Australia release introduces enhanced protections for read‑only fields across the ServiceNow AI Platform®. These changes include a new “read\_only\_option” field with granular control levels, including “strict\_read\_only” and “client\_script\_modifiable". The changes occur in the back end and maintain backward‑compatible behavior. This update helps strengthen your instance security while preserving the flexibility you need. Refer to [KB2718122](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2718122) for additional technical details on how to identify affected fields and adjust their settings. For more information about granular read-only security options, see [Configuring read-only security options](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/table-administration-and-data-management/read-only-option.md).

ServiceNow SDK

</td><td>

To upgrade to the latest version of the ServiceNow SDK globally or within an application, see [Upgrade the ServiceNow SDK](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/servicenow-sdk/upgrade-servicenow-sdk.md).

ServiceNow SDK version 4.4 supports integration with ServiceNow instances beginning with the Washington DC release.

On Windows systems, after upgrading to ServiceNow SDK version 4.3 or later, existing stored credentials aren’t supported due to the deprecation of Keytar. Users on Windows systems must add their user credentials again using the `now-sdk auth --add` command to authenticate with instances. For more information, see [Authenticating to a ServiceNow instance with the ServiceNow SDK](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/servicenow-sdk/authenticate-instance-now-sdk.md).

**Important:** For minor releases of the ServiceNow SDK, see the [ServiceNow SDK release notes](https://github.com/ServiceNow/sdk/releases) on GitHub.

Source-to-Pay Operations Integrations

</td><td>

**Important:** Due to a performance issue identified with the upgrade fix script, the sourcing fix script has been modified. This script will no longer execute automatically during the upgrade process. Instead, it is now delivered as an on-demand job. Administrators must manually execute this job outside of business hours after the upgrade is complete.

Subscription Management

</td><td>

Subscription Management version 6.1 is active by default on all instances of the Australia release. Update to Subscription Management version 6.1 or later to use the latest features. For more information about updating Subscription Management, see [Update an application or plugin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/application-manager/update-application-app-mgr.md).

Third-party Risk Management

</td><td>

If you’re a VRM user upgrading to TPRM and upgrading to Australia from an earlier release, you must run each upgrade sequentially to ensure that fix scripts run correctly. For example, you must upgrade from Xanadu to Yokohama, Yokohama to Zurich, and so on. If the scripts don’t run in the correct order, you can get data inconsistencies, broken functionalities, and conflicts.

After upgrading to version 21.0.x, you can enable the Smart Assessment Engine \(SAE\) by setting the Smart Assessment Engine enabled \(**sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.sae\_enabled**\) property. After setting this property, Smart Assessment Engine \(SAE\) becomes the default assessment engine and replaces the legacy experience. The transition isn’t reversible.

**Warning:**

Set this property in your non-production instances and conduct thorough testing before changing your production instances. Failure to do so may result in unexpected issues.

For more information on upgrading from VRM to TPRM and the differences between the Smart and Classic Assessment engines, see [Third-party Risk Management upgrade information](release-notes/grc-tprm-upgrade-info.md).

For existing TPRM customers, after upgrading to version 21.0.3, data from the Industry column in the Company \[core\_company\] table is automatically migrated to the tprm\_industry column. Migration can take several hours depending on the number of records in the Company \[core\_company\] table. After migration, a system log message confirms that the migration is complete. Review the Company \[core\_company\] table content and update any customizations referencing the Industry field to use tprm\_industry. After verifying the migration and updating customizations, you can drop the Industry column.
