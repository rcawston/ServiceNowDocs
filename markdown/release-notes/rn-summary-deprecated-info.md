    -   OAuth JWT API endpoint for external clients
    -   OIDC provider to verify ID tokens

Path tracking has been moved to the Path Column on the Container Image Finding \[sn\_vul\_container\_image\_findings\] table to support accurate and consistent path and image association.

If you use these integrations you must refer to the Path column available on the Container Image Finding \[sn\_vul\_container\_image\_findings\] table.

If you're currently using the Vulnerability Response with Wiz integrations, after updating to version 1.1, you must backdate any of your existing Wiz primary integrations by three days and run them.

Financial Services Operations Core

</td><td>

-   The FSO tables `sn_bom_m2m_service_definition_user_criteria` and `sn_bom_m2m_service_definition_customer_condition` are deprecated. If you're on an upgraded instance, you can continue to reference these tables, but they're no longer maintained. Use `sn_csm_case_types_service_user_criteria` and `sn_csm_case_types_service_customer_criteria` instead. For more information, see [FSO Core Banking tables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/fso-core-banking-tables.md).
-   The **Show in Interceptor** field \(`show_in_interceptor`\) on the `sn_bom_service_definition` table is deprecated. Use agent criteria in the `sn_csm_case_types_service_user_criteria` table to control which service definitions appear in the case type selector.

User criteria mappings control the visibility of new service definitions. To hide a service definition, map it to the **No User** user criteria. To make it visible, map it to the **Users with sn\_bom.service\_definition\_read** user criteria. Both user criteria records are predefined in Financial Services Operations Core.

For more information, see [Components installed with case types](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/service-definitions-components.md).
