# Phase 1 - Read the release notes and plan your upgrade

Before you begin the upgrade process, it is essential to read the release notes for your target version so you understand the required upgrade and migration tasks. This information helps you plan a safe and effective upgrade.

## Before you begin

**Important:** If multiple software versions are involved in your upgrade, be sure to consult the release notes for each version between your current version and the target version.

Role required: admin.

## Procedure

1.  Read the release notes for your target version.

    Review upgrade and migration tasks that you will need to complete before or after your upgrade.

    -   ServiceNow provides release notes for every release. The release notes offer valuable information about new functionality, notable changes, and fixes available in a particular version. Read the [Australia release notes](family-release-notes.md) to determine whether the upgrade contains functionality you need and fixes that resolve any issues affecting your instance. The release notes can also help you determine whether items you previously customized are being upgraded.
    -   For Australia -specific upgrade considerations, see [Pre- and post-upgrade tasks for various products](upgrade-and-migration-tasks.md).
    -   If you are thinking about upgrading to the Australia family, problem \(PRB\) fixes can be an important factor in your upgrade plans. You can generate a list of . Compare the lists of fixed problems across various Australia upgrade scenarios to help you decide which release version to upgrade to.
2.  Complete the preparation and planning tasks in Phase 2 of the [Upgrade planning checklist](upgrades-planning-checklist.md).

    The checklist contains a list of planning tasks that guide you through various aspects of upgrade preparation. You are guided through tasks such as scoping, gathering stakeholders, identifying features to disable and enable, and creating test plans to use throughout the upgrade. Follow these steps to ensure that all aspects of your organization are ready for the upgrade.

3.  To better prepare for the upgrade, evaluate the level of customizations on your instances.

    For information on customization best practice guidelines, visit the [Customer Success Center website](https://www.servicenow.com/success/playbook/innovate-at-scale.html).

</table>4.  Create a comprehensive test plan that includes test cases for all core instance functionality and integrations, including any customizations you may have.

    To efficiently test and evaluate system functionality, create a set of detailed test scripts for your testing team to use. You will use this test plan throughout each instance upgrade.

-   Use the ServiceNow [Automated Test Framework](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/automated-test-framework-atf/automated-test-framework.md) to assist you in testing your non-production instances.
-   You can use Automated Test Framework quick start tests and product testing suites to help you jump start your testing before and after upgrades. For a list of available tests and activation information, see [Quick start tests](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/automated-test-framework-atf/quick-start-tests.md).
-   For extra testing coverage, you can also conduct user acceptance testing \(UAT\) on your non-production instances.
