-   **[Security &amp; privacy tab in AI Control Tower](../intelligent-experiences/ai-control-tower/security-privacy-tab.md)**
    -   Customize the AI asset security score by weighting LLM guardrail categories that comprise the score. The score formula was changed to an average across all AI assets. The score was renamed to the AI asset security score.
    -   Measure whether your model's output or behavior potentially violates predefined LLM guardrail policies using the Data integrity incident detection chart.
    -   Review potential threats in AI agent output in Agent goal deviation, output with PII detected, and Agentic output injection detection charts.
    -   Monitor MCP server access by AI Gateway with these new charts: Clients connecting to MCP servers, authorized access attempts, and failed access attempts.
    -   The Prompt injection, Offensive content, and Sensitive data tabs have been removed and replaced by the **Access** and **Guardrails** tabs. Metrics have been reorganized into those two tabs.
    -   In **Configurations**, under **Data**, the **Data privacy** tab was renamed to **Security &amp; privacy**. In that tab, the data leak detection and anonymization section was renamed to sensitive data input and anonymization.

Enable and set up data integrity incident detection, agent goal deviation, and output screening metrics to measure the integrity of your data model and potential threats in LLM output.

-   **[Manage agentic AI system life cycles](../intelligent-experiences/ai-control-tower/create-ai-system-assets.md)**

Create AI system assets to track and manage the complete life cycles of your agentic AI systems, from onboarding to deployment. Gain comprehensive insight into each agentic AI system and take any necessary actions to successfully complete each life-cycle stage. By managing the life cycles of your agentic AI systems, you can extend their lifespans, reduce downtime, and optimize licensing costs.

-   **[Define the use and purpose of an AI system](../intelligent-experiences/ai-control-tower/create-ai-system-assets.md)**

Specify the intended use and purpose of an AI system. Provide insight into who is using the AI system, what the AI system is being used for, and how the AI system works and provides value. This information can help you determine the benefits and risks that are associated with the AI system. For more information on classifying AI systems based on regulatory risk at intake by applying a configured Risk Assessment Methodology \(RAM\), see [AI Risk and Compliance release notes](release-notes/grc-ai-risk-and-compliance-rn.md) and [Assessment templates and risk assessment methodologies](../governance-risk-compliance/ai-risk-management/assessment-templates-rams.md).

-   **[Associate additional related AI asset types with AI systems](../intelligent-experiences/ai-control-tower/create-ai-system-assets.md)**

Associate the following additional related AI asset types with your AI systems:

    -   If an AI system has an Asset type of Generative AI or Agentic AI, you can associate it with any of its supported components or subsystems.
    -   If an AI system has an Asset type of Agentic AI, you can associate it with any of its integrated AI tools.

AI Risk and Compliance

</td><td>

-   **[Risk‑based classification during intake](../governance-risk-compliance/ai-risk-management/request-ai-system.md)**

After upgrading to version 22.0.3, if you have the AI risk and compliance business user \[sn\_grc\_ai\_gov.ai\_risk\_and\_compliance\_business\_user\] role, you can now classify AI systems using a risk‑based approach at intake, enabling organizations to capture AI risk context early and align governance workflows with regulatory and internal risk requirements. This improvement to the AI use case request form supports more accurate AI oversight throughout the system life cycle.

-   **[Report an AI case anonymously](../governance-risk-compliance/ai-risk-management/report-ai-case-anon.md)**

After upgrading to version 22.0.3, if you have the AI case business user \[sn\_ai\_case\_mgmt.ai\_case\_business\_user\] role, you can navigate to the Employee Center to access the Anonymous Reporting Center and submit AI cases anonymously, enabling broader participation in AI governance while protecting the identity of reporters. No additional role is required to submit an anonymous report directly through the Anonymous Reporting Center. Broader participation helps organizations identify potential AI risks earlier by removing barriers to case submission.

-   **[Offboard AI models and datasets](../governance-risk-compliance/ai-risk-management/airc-offboarding-ai-assets.md)**

After upgrading to version 22.0.3, if you have the AI risk and compliance analyst \[sn\_grc\_ai\_gov.ai\_risk\_and\_compliance\_analyst\] or AI risk and compliance manager \[sn\_grc\_ai\_gov.ai\_risk\_and\_compliance\_manager\] role you can manage AI asset offboarding life cycle tasks. Managing these tasks helps ensure that governance‑related activities, such as risk and impact assessments, conformity reviews, issue closure, and audit documentation, are addressed when an AI asset is retired or removed from active use.


</td></tr><tr><td>

AI Search

</td><td>

-   **[Improve search precision and contextual relevance with hybrid search](../platform-administration/ai-search/hybrid-search-ais.md)**

Hybrid search combines keyword-based search with semantic understanding to deliver more accurate and relevant search results, with fewer zero-result searches.

-   **[Configure AI Search as the source for Ask Now Assist suggestions](../platform-administration/ai-search/configure-ai-search-source-ask-now-assist-suggestions.md)**

Admins can configure the system to use AI Search as the source for Ask Now Assist suggestions in enhanced chat. Making this change activates suggestion term highlighting in Ask Now Assist and provides improvements such as wildcard searching and lemmatization for suggestions.

    -   Define workflow approval steps and optional chains that progress through multiple approval levels based on rule evaluations.
    -   Set the approval order using combinations of levels, roles, and conditions.
    -   Define approval users and groups.
    -   Consolidate multiple email notifications on an approval request for an approver so that the approver receives a single email notification.
-   **[Intelligent routing rules and smart reapprovals](../order-management/set-approval-trigger-conditions.md)**

Automatically trigger approvals by setting conditions based on items such as discount percentage, deal size, and margin thresholds. Configure thresholds and conditions so the approval workflow skips approved steps that have already been approved if the underlying conditions haven't changed.

-   **[Escalations](../order-management/create-approval-configuration.md)**

Enable approval rule admins to escalate an approval request by reassigning a pending approval request to another approver automatically when the original approver does not act within a specified time.

-   **[Override an approval step](../order-management/override-approval-step.md)**

As an approval rule writer who also has the approval admin role, override or bypass a pending approval request step to unblock an approval request when the approval is no longer required.

Inform sales agents and approvers of the status of approval items moving through the approval workflow by setting up notifications. Use predefined system notifications for reminders and escalations.

-   **[Flexible submission for approval requests](../order-management/submitting-approval-requests.md)**

Before submitting requests for approval, see the required approvals, approver names, approval reasons, and approval sequencing by creating and previewing approval requests. Requesters can recall approval requests for changes and resubmit them.

-   **[Ad-hoc approvers](../order-management/add-approver.md)**

As a requester or an approver, add one or more approvers or approval groups to an approval request, outside of the predefined approvers for a given rule. Enables approval users to add approvers who have more expertise on certain aspects of the request, for example if there are legal or regulatory issues relevant to the request.

-   **[Real-time status tracking and approval history](../order-management/tracking-approval-status.md)**

Monitor approval progress and access an audit trail with detailed status for each approval step including assigned approvers, actual approvers \(for completed steps\), approval comments, and assignment and completion timestamps.

-   **[Approval management](../order-management/approving-approval-requests.md)**
    -   Accept or reject approvals using multiple channels, such as email, push notifications, the CSM Configurable Workspace, or approval centers, such as My Approvals in the ServiceNow AI Platform®.
    -   Assign backup approvers with date-specific coverage periods for seamless continuity of the approval process.

Advanced Risk

</td><td>

-   **[Risk event response template enhancements](../governance-risk-compliance/grc-risk-management-workspace/create-risk-event-response-template.md)**

After upgrading to version 22.0.x, users with the Risk Manager \[sn\_risk.manager\] or Risk Admin \[sn\_risk.admin\] role can configure risk event response templates using dynamic, entity‑driven assignments. These changes enable assignments to be derived from entity data alongside existing static user or group selection.

You can select user fields defined on the entity \(such as Owner or Sub-owner\) or entity stakeholder personas when configuring:

    -   Risk event owner assignment
    -   Issue creation and assignment
    -   Risk event approvers
-   **[Risk Suggestion AI Agent enhancements](../governance-risk-compliance/grc-common-functions/identify-risks-for-entity.md)**

After upgrading the Now Assist for Integrated Risk Management \(IRM\) application to version 22.x, the Risk Suggestion AI Agent supports a more context‑aware and conversational workflow. After selecting risk types, you can provide additional context to refine search results, with the agent dynamically asking follow‑up questions when needed. Before adding risks to the suggested risk section, you can review and modify suggested risks by updating descriptions, renaming risks, or removing items from the list.

-   **[Control Objective workflow](../governance-risk-compliance/grc-risk-management-workspace/create-control-objective-ws.md)**

After upgrading to version 22.0.x, you can use a defined workflow to update control objectives. Changes can be drafted and reviewed without changing the current active version, which helps avoid unintended changes to related controls, and risk records. Only approved updates become active. The workflow also sets clear responsibility for making updates and helps keep control objective information consistent and up to date.

Build formulas manually using the Formula Builder panel, which guides you through selecting functions and referencing columns with inline suggestions. As you type, the builder validates your formula in real-time and displays clear error messages if corrections are needed.

You can accelerate formula creation with AI by describing your calculation in natural language. AI generates a valid formula that you can insert directly into the editor, saving you the time to manually build a valid formula.

-   **[Kanban board filters](../it-business-management/collaborative-work-management/cwm-board-views.md)**

Save time finding the work that matters most by applying quick filters directly on your Kanban board.

As you adjust filter conditions in the header, the quick filter panel stays in sync, and vice versa. Your filter choices automatically apply to saved views and CWM Board templates, so the next time you open the board, your preferences are readily available.

-   **[Scrum tasks](../it-business-management/collaborative-work-management/managing-scrum-tasks-for-stories-cwm.md)**

Improve sprint execution by breaking user stories into scrum tasks that make estimation easier and daily progress visible. These tasks appear as nested children in the List, Kanban, and Sprint planning views, so that your team sees how individual efforts roll up into the larger story.

Using AI to generate an initial set of scrum tasks based on your story descriptions, you can reduce the overhead of task creation. Trigger the scrum task generation from the story form or inline from the Sprint planning view, and receive a relevant set of tasks as a starting point for your sprint planning. You can then review, edit, and add the generated tasks to fit your team's workflow.

-   **[Task dependencies and relationships](../it-business-management/collaborative-work-management/managing-task-dependencies-relationships-cwm.md)**

Increase visibility into how work is connected by linking related items directly in CWM and avoid switching context to track dependencies.

As these relationships surface across Kanban, List, and Gantt views with clear visual cues, you can improve planning confidence for your teams. Blocked items stand out at a glance, helping teams spot bottlenecks early, communicate delays quickly, and plan tasks in the right sequence.

-   **[Team member roles for project work](../it-business-management/collaborative-work-management/cwm-team-member-roles.md)**

View and update project and demand tasks directly in CWM using team member roles, installed alongside Collaborative Work Management.

The team member read role lets users view project and demand tasks and leave comments. The team member read-write role also lets users edit those tasks. Team members can view and manage the work assigned to them and their team through **My Work** and **Connected Work** in CWM.

-   **[Image download from docs](../it-business-management/collaborative-work-management/cwm-docs.md)**

Compliance Case Management

</td><td>

-   **[Report a compliance case anonymously](../governance-risk-compliance/compliance-case-management/report-compliance-case-anonymously.md)Report compliance cases anonymously**

Employees can now use the Anonymous Reporting Center to report compliance violations such as fraud and embezzlement, workplace misconduct \(harassment, discrimination\), bribery and corruption, and other concerns without revealing their identity or location.

Accessed through the Employee Center, the Anonymous Reporting Center portal automatically logs users out to enforce anonymity, creates case records without mapping to employee identity, and provides a unique report key and report number for secure follow-up communication.

CAPTCHA‑based verification is used to authenticate submissions, and the system generates a report statement summarizing the case after submission. Employees can save a copy of their report for future reference. For security and confidentiality, the submitted information is not displayed again. Reports are routed to the appropriate compliance team based on the nature of the concern.

Throughout the investigation process:

    -   Investigators can request additional information through a comments system visible to the reporter
    -   Reporters can follow up on their case using their report key to check progress and respond to questions
    -   All interactions maintain reporter anonymity at every step; no identity or location data is ever captured or linked
This enhancement enables organizations to build trust, mitigate risks before escalation, and ensures regulatory compliance with whistleblower protection requirements.

-   **[GRC case summarization skill for compliance cases](../governance-risk-compliance/grc-common-functions/compliance-case-summarization-skill.md)AI-driven compliance case summarization**

After upgrading Now Assist for Integrated Risk Management \(IRM\) application to version 22.x, Compliance analysts can use the Case summarization feature to quickly understand a compliance case without manually reviewing every field, attachment, or related list. Now Assist analyzes key case attributes—such as timelines, impacted areas, evidence, and actions—and generates a structured summary directly inside the compliance case.

This solves a common problem: case data is often lengthy, scattered across multiple related lists, and difficult for analysts to digest efficiently. Analysts can also save and edit summaries as case data evolves, ensuring the record stays current.

By consolidating all relevant information into a single, coherent narrative, Now Assist reduces investigation time, improves consistency across reviewers, and supports faster decision-making.

Configuration Compliance

</td><td>

-   **[Tenable compliance test uniqueness key](../security-management/vulnerability-response/cc-tenable-compliance-test-uniqueness-key.md)**

You can now configure which identifier the system uses to uniquely match incoming Tenable compliance test records. Previously, compliance tests were identified by the check\_id field, which caused records to be overwritten when multiple tests shared the same control identifier. You can now select the identifier that best matches how your Tenable data is structured \(**compliance\_control\_id**, **check\_id**, or **compliance\_functional\_id**\), ensuring test records are accurately preserved during ingestion.

-   **[Qualys parameter to ignore passed test results](../security-management/configuration-compliance/Qualys-cc-Integration.md)**

Starting with v15.2.5 of Configuration Compliance, the ignore\_passed\_result integration instance parameter for the Qualys Integration for Security Operations has been added.

This parameter is set to `false` by default so that passed test results imported by Qualys are not ignored.

Set the parameter to **true** to ignore passed test results on import.

**Note:** If activated, this parameter does not impact closure of the test results. For example, if you activate the parameter, and a failed test result from a previous import has since passed, it will be closed correctly.

-   **[AWS Integration for Security Exposure Management](../security-management/vulnerability-response/aws-integration-for-security-exposure-management-overview.md)**

The AWS Integration for Security Exposure Management supports integrations with the following AWS services:

    -   AWS Inspector is an automated vulnerability management service that continuously scans EC2 instances, ECR container images, and Lambda functions for software vulnerabilities \(CVEs\) and unintended network exposure. The Vulnerability Response integration with AWS Inspector imports host and container vulnerability findings from AWS Inspector.
    -   AWS Security Hub is a security service that is used to centralize and update security checks across AWS accounts. It provides a unified view of security alerts and compliance status by integrating with various AWS services. The Vulnerability Response integration with AWS Security Hub imports host, container vulnerabilities, and misconfigurations from AWS Security Hub.
-   **[Optimized Tenable.io Compliance Results ingestion](../security-management/vulnerability-response/tenableIntegration.md)**

    -   Use the Service Graph Workspace to view data, such as company, location, user, and CMDB data, using panels and dashboards. The Service Graph Workspace is specifically organized to help CMDB administrators, data owners, and analysts work with the CMDB. You can search the CMDB in Service Graph Workspace without having detailed knowledge of the CMDB data model by using contexts that are mapped to CI classes as navigation.
    -   Configure de-duplication remediation processes for related tables to turn off automated workflows, such as ignoring errors and skipping business rules, that might block referenced duplicate CIs from updating to the main CI. Skipping automated workflows for related tables enables de-duplication tasks, which would otherwise fail, to complete successfully. For more information, see [Effects on related tables \(such as Change\)](../servicenow-platform/configuration-management-database-cmdb/de-duplication-tasks.md) and [Turn off workflows of related tables during remediation](../servicenow-platform/configuration-management-database-cmdb/dedup-ci-disable-workflow.md).
-   **[Dynamic IRE](../servicenow-platform/configuration-management-database-cmdb/dynamic-ire.md)**

Use Dynamic IRE to accurately identify CIs across multiple data sources, and by so, minimize duplicate CIs. Dynamic IRE is applicable only to the Hardware \[cmdb\_ci\_hardware\] class and its descending class, using a dynamic identification process which eliminates the need to manually create and maintain identification rules.

-   **[Simplify resolving de-duplication tasks by using a Now Assist for CMDB skill](../servicenow-platform/configuration-management-database-cmdb/reconcile-dup-task.md)**

Use the De-duplication task resolution assistant skill in the Duplicate CI Remediator to use preselected remediation options instead of manually making selections.

    -   The Universally Unique Identifier \(UUID\) provided by Wiz is now mapped as the detection key for the Wiz Host Vulnerability integration.
    -   AWS ECS \(Elastic Container Service\) and AWS EKS \(Elastic Kubernetes Service\) environments are supported.
    -   Cluster and Service are supported for AWS ECS environments.
    -   Namespace, Registry, and Service are supported for AWS EKS environments.
    -   Choose either Scanner \(third-party scanners\) or Discovery \(Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\)\) as sources for data import for AWS ECS and AWS EKS.

**Note:**

If you choose **Discovery** as the data source, the Populate image relationships scheduled job runs daily to pre-import cluster and service details, and you should schedule your third-party integration runs at least 4 hours after this scheduled job is completed to verify that the pre-import data is available. This job is activated by default, but you must set the schedule so it runs before your scheduled third-party integration runs.

For new customers only: The system property, sn\_vul\_container.image\_relationship\_mapping\_months sets the number of previous months \(1-12\) that you want your third-party integration to look for container image updates when processing relationship mappings. This data is used to filter images by the sys\_updated\_on field. The default setting is three months. After you configure the integration run, relationship mapping is created for images which have been scanned in the last 90 days and present in discovered container images.

    -   Column labels on the Container Vulnerable item \[sn\_vul\_container\_image\_vulnerable\_item\] table are updated to support the scanner and discovery options, depending on your choice on the Configure Image Vulnerability Keys configuration page:
        -   Cluster \(Scanner\) Namespace \(scanner\), and Service \(scanner\) for scanner data

Key highlights:

    -   When disabled, only the State field is added to control objective records. Active records show Published, inactive records show Retired, and new records default to Draft.
    -   When enabled, control objectives move through: Draft, Review, Approved, Current version, and Retired. The following new fields are also introduced: State, Effective date, Revision type, and Record nature.
    -   Editing a published control objective creates a working draft, keeping the published record active until approved changes are published.
    -   Users must select a revision type: Major or Minor. A Major revision moves associated controls back to Draft. A Minor revision applies updates without moving controls back to Draft.
    -   The Owner and Owning Group fields control who can edit the control objective and perform workflow actions.

    -   As UCF control objectives cannot be deactivated, the Identify Duplicates and Finalize sub-states guide the users to retain the UCF control objective. Any UCF recommendations that are not retained are automatically dismissed when the user requests review.
    -   Only one UCF control objective can be retained at a time. If you retain a different UCF control objective, the previously retained one is automatically dismissed.
    -   When rationalization is complete, the retained UCF control objective stays active, accepted non-UCF recommendations are deactivated, and any dismissed UCF control objectives remain active and unchanged.

Employees can now use the Anonymous Reporting Center to report privacy violations such as data breaches or exposure, unauthorized data use, privacy law violations \(GDPR, CCPA\), or other privacy-by-design lapses without revealing their identity or location.

Accessed through the Employee Center, the Anonymous Reporting Center portal automatically logs users out to enforce anonymity, creates case records without mapping to employee identity, and provides a unique report key for secure follow-up communication.

Reports are routed to the appropriate compliance team based on the nature of the concern. Throughout the investigation process:

    -   Investigators can request additional information through a comments system visible to the reporter
    -   Reporters can follow up on their case using their report key to check progress and respond to questions
    -   All interactions maintain reporter anonymity at every step; no identity or location data is ever captured or linked
This enhancement enables organizations to build trust, mitigate risks before escalation, and ensures regulatory compliance with whistleblower protection requirements.

-   **[GRC case summarization skill for privacy cases](../governance-risk-compliance/privacy-workspace/privacy-case-summarization-skill.md)**

Privacy analysts can now use the Now Assist case summarization feature to quickly understand a privacy case without manually reviewing every field or related list. Now Assist analyzes key case attributes, such as timelines, impacted areas, evidence, and actions, and generates a structured summary directly inside the privacy case. This solves a common problem: case data is often lengthy, scattered across multiple related lists, and difficult for analysts to digest efficiently. Analysts can also save and edit summaries as case data evolves, ensuring the record stays current.

-   **[Hierarchy and lineage enhancements](../governance-risk-compliance/privacy-workspace/hierarchy-tab.md)**

The Hierarchy and lineage enhancements enables privacy teams to identify which systems, vendors, and applications belong to a specific processing activity by marking relationships as “part of a processing activity.” This differentiates scoped components from global or shared connections. Users can toggle between a processing‑activity‑scoped view and a full lineage view, helping them understand data flows in the appropriate context.

-   **[Privacy content accelerator](../governance-risk-compliance/privacy-workspace/privacy-content-accelerator.md)**

The privacy regulatory content through Unified Content Management provides pre‑built authority documents, citations, control objectives, and risk statements aligned with major privacy frameworks, including GDPR, CCPA, LGPD, and the NIST Privacy Framework 1.0. These resources are available for download directly from the Privacy Workspace, enabling teams to readily access standardized regulatory content.

This consolidation deprecates the standalone Microsoft Defender for Cloud plugin. The unified plugin also introduces container image vulnerability ingestion from Microsoft Defender for Cloud, creating Container Vulnerable Items on your instance. A guided migration path is available to transfer existing data from the deprecated applications to the unified plugin.

-   **[AWS Integration for Security Exposure Management](../security-management/vulnerability-response/aws-integration-for-security-exposure-management-overview.md)**

The AWS Integration for Security Exposure Management supports integrations with the following AWS services:

    -   AWS Inspector is an automated vulnerability management service that continuously scans EC2 instances, ECR container images, and Lambda functions for software vulnerabilities \(CVEs\) and unintended network exposure. The Vulnerability Response integration with AWS Inspector imports host and container vulnerability findings from AWS Inspector.
    -   AWS Security Hub is a security service that is used to centralize and update security checks across AWS accounts. It provides a unified view of security alerts and compliance status by integrating with various AWS services. The Vulnerability Response integration with AWS Security Hub imports host, container vulnerabilities, and misconfigurations from AWS Security Hub.
-   **[Optimized Tenable.io Compliance Results ingestion](../security-management/vulnerability-response/tenableIntegration.md)**

Starting with v 6.1.3, the Tenable.io Compliance Results Integration is replaced by the Tenable.io Fixed Compliance Results Integration and Tenable.io Open Compliance Results Integration. Compliance results are now imported based on their status, optimizing ingestion performance and scalability for environments with large volumes of compliance data while keeping remediation and compliance tracking aligned with the current state of findings.

-   **[Qualys Integration – API enhancements](../security-management/vulnerability-response/c_QualysVulnIntegration.md)**

The Qualys Vulnerability Integration has been upgraded to support newer Qualys API versions across Host Detection, Host List, Knowledgebase, PC Controls, PC Policies, and PCRS integrations. The integrations now ingest additional data fields, including vulnerability detection source, authentication privilege status, active status for controls and policies, and cloud metadata, giving you better visibility into your vulnerability and compliance data. Use the new `posture_api_version` integration instance parameter to choose between the default v2.0 APIs or the newer v5.0 streaming APIs for the PCRS Policy Host and PCRS Test Results integrations.

-   **[Vulnerability Data Management with Central Vulnerability Database \(CVDB\)](../security-management/vulnerability-response/cvd-overview.md)**

The Central Vulnerability Database \(CVDB\) introduces a unified, source-agnostic vulnerability data layer that consolidates data from multiple sources into a single authoritative record, improving accuracy, consistency, and traceability. Key capabilities include:

    -   Unified vulnerability record: Correlates vulnerability data from multiple sources, supports sources including National Vulnerability Database \(NVD\), scanner intelligence, European Union Vulnerability Database, Japanese Vulnerability Database, and vulnerability intelligence feeds.
    -   Priority-based data reconciliation configuration:
        -   Field-level priority: Ensures each attribute \(e.g., CVSS, remediation, exploit status\) can be configured from the most reliable provider.
        -   Source-level priority: Applies a global ranking when field-level rules are not defined.
        -   Hybrid model: Field-level rules take precedence, with source-level fallback; all source data is preserved for full traceability.
    -   Source attribution and traceability: Maintains detailed source metadata, timestamps, and change history to ensure full auditability and transparency.
    -   Data enrichment: Combines CVSS scores, exploit intelligence, and remediation guidance to provide a richer and more actionable vulnerability context.
