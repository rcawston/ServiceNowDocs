-   **[Query ACLs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/access-control/query-acl-rule.md)**

Query ACLs now load automatically during plugin installation for most platform plugins. These preconfigured ACLs reduce the need to run the QueryRangeACLAuditor tool to generate query ACLs. Store app query ACLs aren't included in preconfigured query ACLs. For more information about preconfigured query ACLs, see the [Maintenance Information \[KB2046494\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2046494) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

Existing custom query ACLs are preserved and loaded as inactive. To view inactive ACLs, use this command: `<INSTANCE_URL>/sys_security_acl_list.do?[query_parameters]`

QueryRangeACLAuditor tool modifications are preserved.

-   **[ACL rule types](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/access-control/acl-rule-types.md)**

The consumer dispute intake questionnaire for RC 13.3 now includes an additional question for disputes involving non-fiat currency or NFT purchases. After confirming whether the asset received matched the description at the time of purchase, dispute agents and cardholders are asked whether there is evidence that the merchant guaranteed or promised the asset would increase in value.

Customize semantic descriptions and usage instructions in the table and column configuration tables. Unlike the previous method of editing Entity and Dimension records, these changes can be transferred between instances through update sets.

-   **[View recommended actions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/expl-view-recommended-actions.md)**

AI Data Explorer can suggest actions based on the insights that it generates in an exploration.

-   **[Ask questions about FX currency data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/qg-supported-query-operations.md)**

Query Generation now supports the FXCurrency \(Currency 2\) data type. This means that you can use AI Data Explorer to explore financial operations data, including those within Source-to-Pay Operations.

-   **[Benefit from improvements to segments](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/querygen-segments.md)**

Segments are reusable definitions in Query Generation that provide non-obvious context to assist the semantic layer or LLM to select the correct dimension and values. Users can create manual segments via a new form. A scheduled job synchronizes manual and autogenerated segments. This job also cleans up segments to help surface the correct segments and reduce noise.

Manual segments are re-ranked to take priority over automatically generated segments.

Domain separation is also now supported, with a Domain field on the Segments table. Segments based on reports and filters inherit the source domain. Manual segments have domains that are passed up to the Segments table on synchronization. Segments are not supported for indicator sources or modules on domain-separated instances.
