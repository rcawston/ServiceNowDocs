## New in the Australia release

-   **[Install ITOM Visibility apps using Now Assist for Setup](../../it-operations-management/nowassist-setup-itom-visibility-landing-page.md)**

    Now Assist for Setup provides a centralized, guided installation experience for ITOM Visibility. From a single interface, administrators can review what applications are included in the installation, review the installation status, and install all required applications and plugins.


-   **[PowerShell 7 support for Discovery](../../it-operations-management/discovery/powershell-remoting.md)**

    Discovery now supports PowerShell 7, while maintaining backward compatibility with PowerShell 5.1. This update enhances security, accelerates onboarding, and reduces deployment blockers through improved runtime detection and comprehensive test coverage.

-   **[Discovery on Code Signing instances](../../it-operations-management/discovery/code-sign-disco-probes.md)**

    Discovery now enforces code signing for probes, parameters, and sensors to guarantee authenticity, integrity, and secure execution on MID Servers. This update blocks unsigned or tampered payloads, provides signature validation, and strengthens compliance by helping prevent audit gaps without impacting discovery performance.

-   **[Discovery generic attributes](../../it-operations-management/discovery/disco-generic-attributes.md)**

    Enhance Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\) data accuracy with new Discovery capabilities that auto-populate non-discoverable attributes using a schedule-based mechanism. This update simplifies configuration item \(CI\) management by propagating generic attribute values across schedules and ranges, reducing manual effort and improving usability.

-   **[Use Kubernetes Visibility Agent \(KVA\) and Service Mapping to create service maps for extended services beyond Kubernetes](../../it-operations-management/service-mapping/mapping-k8s-sm-kva.md)**

    Service Mapping complements Kubernetes Visibility Agent \(KVA\) capabilities to map services that include Kubernetes and all related service resources beyond the Kubernetes environment. Install the latest version of Kubernetes Visibility Agent \(KVA\) to detect the latest changes in your Kubernetes cluster and run Service Mapping to have an up to date visualization of your services across Kubernetes and related resources.

-   **[Quick start tests for Service Mapping](../../it-operations-management/service-mapping/quick-start-tests-service-mapping.md)**

    After upgrades and deployments of new applications or integrations, run quick start tests to verify that Service Mapping works as expected. If you customized Service Mapping, copy the quick start tests and configure them for your customizations.


## Deprecations

-   Starting with the Zurich release, Cloud Discovery Workspace is being prepared for future deprecation. It’s hidden and no longer activated on new instances but continues to be supported. Discovery Admin Workspace provides the latest experience for this functionality. For details, see the [Application/Plugin Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support knowledge base.

## Activation information

ITOM Visibility is available with activation of the Discovery \(com.snc.discovery\) plugin and the Service Mapping \(com.snc.service-mapping\) plugin, which require an ITOM Visibility subscription. For details, see [Request Discovery](../../it-operations-management/discovery/t_ActivateTheDiscoveryPlugin.md) and [Request Service Mapping](../../it-operations-management/service-mapping/t_ActivateServiceMappingPlugin.md). For full ITOM Visibility functionality, install the latest ITOM Visibility applications from the ServiceNow Store..

## Plugin information

-   **New plugins**

    The following ServiceNow Store application is new in Australia:

    AI Agent Topology Mapping \(sn\_itom\_agnt\_ptrn\): Discovers and maps AI agents, large language models, and prompts across hyperscaler environments, and populates the CMDB with the results.


## Related ServiceNow applications and features

-   ****

    The ServiceNow® ITOM AIOps product includes the ServiceNow® Event Management and ServiceNow® Metric Intelligence applications, which help you track and maintain the health of services in your organization.

    Event Management gathers alerts from infrastructure events that both third-party monitoring tools and the ServiceNow® internal agent capture. Event Management uses IT-related information that ServiceNow® Discovery gathers so it can map alerts to configuration items. Based on the collected information, Event Management then provides dashboards that show a consolidated view of all service-impact events.

    The Agent Client Collector application enables you to do the following:

    -   Monitor your service availability.
    -   Examine the health and performance of your environment.
    -   Ensure that your infrastructure and its applications are running properly.
    Agent Client Collector collects events and metrics. It runs in either a Windows or Linux environment.
