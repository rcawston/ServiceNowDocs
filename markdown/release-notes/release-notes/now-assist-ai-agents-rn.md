## Now Assist AI Agents highlights for the Australia release

[Australia Patch 1](../australia-patch-1.md)

-   Test an agentic solution in the playground in AI-native mode.
-   Add widgets for tool outputs to provide an improved experience in AI-native mode.
-   Run improved Platform agentic workflows, including Generate resolution plans, Generate my work plan, and Process images to tasks.
-   Get more insights into agentic AI asset performance with issue tracing and suggested optimizations from results pages.

See [Now Assist AI agents](../../intelligent-experiences/na-ai-agents.md) for more information.

For the Platform Now Assist release notes, see [Now Assist release notes](now-assist-rn.md).

**Important:** Now Assist AI agents are available in the ServiceNow Store. For details, see the "Activation information" section of these release notes.

## New in the Australia release

-   **[Create an AI agent](../../intelligent-experiences/configure-next-best-action-agent.md)**

    The AI-native experience for an AI agent is available exclusively with the installation of the Off Glide Conversation Server plugin \(com.glide.cs.offglide\).

    **Note:** To use the AI agent in AI-native mode, make sure to test it so it works as expected.

-   **[Test an agentic solution in AI Native mode](../../intelligent-experiences/test-ai-agent.md)**

    Use the AI Native playground experience to test your agentic solutions.

    **Note:** The AI-native playground experience is exclusively accessible when the Off Glide Conversation Server plugin \(com.glide.cs.offglide\) is installed. If the plugin is not installed, you will continue to access the standard testing playground.

-   **[Add tools and information to an AI agent](../../intelligent-experiences/add-tool-aia.md)**

    Add widgets for tool outputs to provide an improved experience in AI-native mode.

    **Note:** The display output widget options are exclusively accessible when the Off Glide Conversation Server plugin \(com.glide.cs.offglide\) is installed. If the plugin is not installed, you will continue to access the standard add tool form.


## UI changes

-   **[Manually test the execution of an AI agent](../../intelligent-experiences/test-ai-agent.md) and [Manually test the execution of an agentic workflow](../../intelligent-experiences/test-aia-use-case.md)**

    The **AI Native** radio button in the Choose a testing mode section on the AI agent and agentic workflow manual testing playgrounds has been renamed to **Premium Chat**.


## Changed in this release

-   **[Create an external AI agent with the Agent2Agent protocol](../../intelligent-experiences/create-a2a-agent.md)**

    Use the A2A Protocol integration for creating external agents in the AI Agent Studio to connect with the ServiceNow AI Platform.

-   **[Updates to platform agentic workflows](../../intelligent-experiences/platform-use-cases.md)**

    Several platform agentic workflows have seen updates to how they work and what configurations are available for AI admins. [Analyze task trends](../../intelligent-experiences/incident-trends.md) and [Identify ways to improve service](../../intelligent-experiences/service-improvement.md) now have post-analysis actions, including the option to download analysis and ask additional information. [Generate my work plan](../../intelligent-experiences/generate-work-plan.md) can run as a scheduled job.

-   **[Agentic evaluation offer issue tracing and suggested optimizations](../../intelligent-experiences/agentic-evals.md)**

    After an automated evaluation of an agentic AI asset, you can receive a list of issues and suggested optimizations to address those issues. Issues come with individual record node-by-node traces to pinpoint the exact source of problems. Optimizations are suggested, and you can apply them and run a reevaluation from a single guided flow.


## Deprecated features

[Australia Patch 1](../australia-patch-1.md)

-   The support for manually integrating external agents has been deprecated from [Australia Patch 1](../australia-patch-1.md) release.

## Accessibility information

-   **[Voice Input for Now Assist AI agents](../../intelligent-experiences/now-assist-panel-overview.md)**

    Administrators can enable an optional voice input setting for the Now Assist panel in the Now Assist Admin console. This feature gives users a voice-to-text input option to access the Now Assist skills in the panel in any supported language.
