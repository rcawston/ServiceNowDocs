## New in the Australia release

-   ****

    The tax engine integration framework validates supplier-provided tax against system tax at invoice line level, maintains compliance with regional and global tax regulations. This integration triggers automatic tax validation, handles exceptions for tax variance and missing data, enables manual revalidation and rolling up of system tax.


## Changed in this release

-   ****

    The Document classification skill auto-classifies supplier email attachments as invoice, credit memo, or supporting documents with an AI-recommended confidence score. After the classification, separate invoice processing cases are created for invoices and credit memo with supporting documents linked to both the cases. The playbook allows you to configure the confidence threshold for auto-approval or involve AP specialists to manually review them.
