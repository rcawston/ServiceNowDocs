# Financial Services Operations Integration with Verifi release notes

The ServiceNow®Financial Services Operations Integration with Verifi application connects the Financial Services Operations \(FSO\) issuer dispute workflow to Verifi's Cardholder Dispute Resolution Network \(CDRN\) - a Visa owned pre-dispute settlement network. This integration enables issuers to automatically initiate structured negotiations with merchants before disputes escalate to costly chargebacks. Financial Services Operations Integration with Verifi is a new application in the Australia release.

## Financial Services Operations Integration with Verifi highlights for the Australia release

-   A dispute agent proactively initiates dispute resolution without chargeback for the participating merchants.
-   System runs automated merchant eligibility check.
-   Reduced chargeback exposure for merchants.
-   Seamless API integration.

See [Financial Services Operations Integration with Verifi](../../financial-services-operations/financial-services-operations-verifi-cdrn-integration-app-landing-page.md) for more information.

**Important:** Financial Services Operations Integration with Verifi is available in the ServiceNow Store. For details, see the "Activation information" section of these release notes.

## Financial Services Operations Integration with Verifi features

-   Avoids costly chargebacks: When a merchant accepts the dispute and offers a refund that is acceptable for the cardholder, the case is closed as resolved with no chargeback initiated.
-   Automates merchant eligibility checks: The system automatically checks merchant eligibility through the Verifi CDRN API before creating a case. Non-eligible merchants are routed to the standard dispute lifecycle without agent intervention.
-   Seamless closure of disputes: Merchants participating in CDRN can respond to dispute alerts directly through Verifi .
-   Seamless API integration: The four-subflow API sequence — eligibility check, case creation, polling, and acknowledgment handshake — is fully automated and requires no manual API interaction from agents or supervisors.

## UI changes

-   Playbook actions:
    -   Create alert case
    -   Get case details
-   New fields:
    -   Pre-dispute settlement eligibility: Indicates if a merchant is eligible for a CDRN settlement.
    -   Customer decision: Indicates if a cardholder agrees or disagrees with the refund proposed by the merchant.
