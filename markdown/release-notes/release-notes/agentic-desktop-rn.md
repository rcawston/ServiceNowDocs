## Important information for upgrading AI Desktop Actions to Australia

Upgrade the currently installed AI Desktop Actions Software Installers \(MSIs\) by downloading and installing the newer version of the application. Make sure to close the current execution and close the desktop app before staring the installation for upgrade. For more information, see [Download AI Desktop Actions installer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/download-agentic-desktop-installer.md).

**Important:** AI Desktop Actions is available in the ServiceNow Store. For details, see the "Activation information" section of these release notes.

## New in the Australia release

-   **[Use the new application name](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/agentic-desktop-landing-page.md)**

    The product formerly referred to as Agentic Desktop has been rebranded as AI Desktop Actions. All UI labels, navigation elements, and in-product text updated to reflect the new name.

-   **Automate dynamic steps with desktop actions**
    -   Use the desktop action to automate dynamic steps that are determined by AI during execution.
    -   Install the **ServiceNow Web Automation** chrome extension for AI agent to interact with web applications.
    -   Use the default Web Automation Agent AI agent and Web Automation agentic workflow to automate repetitive tasks.
    -   See every click, keystroke, and scroll your AI agent makes in real time, with consent prompts before execution kicks off and timely warnings before your session expires.
    -   Pause a running AI agent, provide corrective input, and resume. The AI agent replans based on your instructions, keeping execution on the right track.
-   **[Use the onboarding wizard to get the app overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/desktop-actions.md)**

    Get a quick overview of the application by using the onboarding wizard that highlights recording, refining, testing, and activating desktop actions.

    Select **Skip intro** to bypass the onboarding wizard and go to the home page. Select the **Don't show this again** option to prevent the wizard from appearing the next time you open the app. After completing the onboarding wizard, select **Get started** to start creating desktop actions.

-   **[Filter required inputs for testing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/test-activate-desktop-action-ad.md)**

    Use filtering options to filter the inputs that are required.

    -   **Show Inputs** — Filters the screens with required input fields.
    -   **Show All** — Removes the filter and displays all screens.

-   **[Improved error and informational messages](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/test-activate-desktop-action-ad.md)**

    Improved error and informational messages for better guidance and troubleshooting during testing of desktop actions.

-   **[Delete button on image canvas](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/agentic-desktop-overview.md)**

    Added a **Delete** button to the image canvas to remove a screen.

-   **[Test button for a screen in the Design tab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/agentic-desktop-overview.md)**

    Test screens directly from the design tab while designing desktop actions.


## UI changes

The system now suggests a full URL instead of a partial URL. For example, `https://<instance name>.servicenow.com`.

Pagination is implemented for desktop actions on the AI Desktop Actions home page, which helps improve navigation and load times.

## Changed in this release

-   **[Optional Application name field](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/add-details-desktop-action-ad.md)**

    The Application field in the Details tab is now optional, enabling you to save and run desktop actions without entering an application name.

-   **[Improved connectors descriptions for non-UI block desktop actions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/desktop-actions-designer-workspace-ad.md)**

    Descriptions for Excel, Word, PDF, and System Actions connectors are enhanced to improve accuracy and selection.
