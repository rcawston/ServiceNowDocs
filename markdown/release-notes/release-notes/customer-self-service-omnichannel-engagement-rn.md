## New in the Australia release

-   **[Configure Web Embeddables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/customer-self-service-and-omnichannel-engagement/using-web-embeddables.md)**

    Embed ServiceNow components into any third-party website or web application to extend the ServiceNow AI Platform capabilities. You can use a library of default configurable components or create custom components.

    You can configure and embed the following ServiceNow components on the third-party websites:

    -   Case list: Displays a comprehensive list of cases along with their key details.
    -   Case view: Shows a detailed view of case and case-related activities. You can display relevant playbooks when created for the case record.
    -   Case create: Displays a form to create a case to address issues related to products and services.
    -   Catalog item: Request Service Catalog items or services.
    -   Knowledge article view: Displays knowledge articles along with key details like title, content, author, view count, read time, and more. You can also rate the article and switch the display language.
    -   Data visualization: Shows a graphical representation of information from any ServiceNow AI Platform table using visual elements such as single score, pie, donut, and semi donut charts.
    -   Playbook intake: Enable your users to submit cases using the Playbook guided experience. Systematically capture case details and display stages, and activities involved in resolving the case.
    -   Catalog browse: Browse and search Service Catalog items from different catalogs and categories within a third-party website.
    -   Object list: Display records from different tables with their related actions in a list format.
-   **[Use Interaction Controls Component \(ICC\) call controls with Amazon Connect](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/amazon-connect-for-voice-calls.md)**

    Manage Amazon Connect calls in the CSM Configurable Workspace voice Interaction record. The integration supports inbound and outbound call flows, presence management, and transfers without switching applications.

-   **[Supervisor call monitoring](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/supervisor-monitoring-for-voice.md)**

    Monitor, coach, and join agent calls from the CSM Configurable Workspace without having to switch to the CCaaS desktop. All supervisor actions are automatically logged for auditing and reporting purpose.

-   **[Agent help request for voice calls](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/agent-help-request-for-voice-calls.md)**

    Empower agents to request supervisor assistance during calls by selecting the **Help Request** button. Agents can specify reasons why they are calling for help to provide more context to the supervisor before the supervisor responds, and receive notifications when supervisors coach or join. All help request data is captured for reporting for data-driven coaching. Some other key features include the following:

    -   Configure phone directory to show or hide Agents, Queues, or External tabs based on CCaaS provider settings. Agents see tabs enabled by the CCaaS provider, preventing transfers to unsupported numbers.
    -   While handling a customer call, agents can now see accurate availability status for other agents, supporting informed transfer decisions. Agent availability status updates in the transfer list and phone directory in real-time during call transfers.
-   **[Use AI to generate wrap up code and notes summary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/ai-generated-wrap-up-codes-and-notes-summary.md)**

    Automatically suggest a wrap-up code and generate an interaction summary based on conversation transcripts by using Now Assist, which reduces manual documentation time and contributes to consistent record-keeping. Choose automatic or agent-initiated generation to fit your workflow.

-   **[Using the Consumer Portal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/use-consumer-portal.md)**

    Support your consumers through the Consumer Portal self-service capabilities such as knowledge articles, service catalogs, case management, Virtual Agent, and others. These capabilities help reduce maintenance effort through low-code configurations on pages with configurable widgets.

-   **[Native callback features](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/contact-center-intergration-with-icc-callback.md)**

    Callback management enables agents to schedule callbacks on behalf of customers. The key features include:

    -   Enable agents to schedule callbacks from any interaction or case.
    -   Equip agents to reschedule or cancel callbacks from the callback record page with proper state tracking.
    -   Facilitate agents to view scheduled callbacks in the list view so they can open the individual callback record page.
    -   Enable agents to view and manage scheduled callbacks for the current interaction or case in the contextual side panel.
-   **[Email interaction feature: Wrap up of email interactions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/using-email-interaction-page.md)**

    Note the following capabilities introduced for wrapping up email interactions:

    -   Introduction of wrap‑up modal for Advanced Work Assignment \(AWA\) and CCaaS‑routed email interactions with internal wrap‑up codes configurable by admins.
    -   Automatic closure of inactive interactions with system-assigned wrap-up codes in multiple scenarios:
        -   When agents create a case from an email interaction.
        -   When the wrap-up modal times out without agent submission.
        -   When customers don’t respond within the defined follow-up period.
-   **[Email interaction feature: Outbound Interaction from agent-initiated email](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/using-email-interaction-page.md)**

    The new capabilities for outbound interactions initiated by agents through email are:

    -   Initiate outbound email interactions from contact or consumer records by selecting email addresses or using the Compose Email UI option, opening a modeless email composer with the recipient's email address auto populated.
    -   Automatic creation of Work‑In‑Progress \(WIP\) outbound email interactions when agents initiate an email to a customer.
    -   Preserve email drafts when agents navigate away, and automatically close interactions that show no sent or received email activity and contain only unsent drafts within a rolling 30‑day period. Any agent activity on the draft resets the 30‑day window.
    -   Consolidate multiple agent‑initiated drafts into a single, unified interaction within service workflows, with ownership assigned to the sending agent. You can optionally configure the system to create separate interactions for each draft for the same contact.
    -   Configurable reminder windows for sending automated reminder emails when customers don’t respond.
    -   Customer response notifications on the ongoing tab and interaction linking in contact or consumer related lists for seamless conversation tracking.
-   **[Email interaction feature: Transfer Email Interactions routed by CCaaS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/using-email-interaction-page.md)**

    Transfer CCaaS‑routed email interactions to another agent or queue, improving accurate handoff and workload distribution.
