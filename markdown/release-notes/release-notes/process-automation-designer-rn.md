## Important information for upgrading Playbooks to Australia

After you upgrade to Australia, update the Workflow Studio application in the ServiceNow Store.

## New in the Australia release

-   **[Nested playbooks](../../build-workflows/workflow-studio/nested-playbooks.md)**

    Nest playbooks as a step within other playbooks to enable the following scenarios:

    -   Define sets of activities for reuse across multiple playbooks to help avoid duplication.
    -   Break up large playbooks for easy maintenance and fast load time in Playbook Designer.
-   **[Simplified end-user playbook experience](../../build-workflows/workflow-studio/wizard-layouts-playbooks.md)**

    Implement a wizard experience for guiding your end users through a sequence of steps to achieve an outcome, such as servicing a printer.

-   **[Automated Test Framework support for playbooks](../../build-workflows/workflow-studio/testing-support-playbooks.md)**

    The Automated Test Framework can be used to create automated tests to confirm your playbooks run as planned.

-   **[Use AI agents as a playbook activity](../../build-workflows/workflow-studio/ai-agent-as-activity.md)**

    Use an existing AI agent as an activity in your playbook to automate tasks. The AI agent gathers the required context, performs the work, and produces outputs that subsequent activities can consume.


## Changed in this release

-   **[Required role update](../../build-workflows/workflow-studio/user-access-playbooks.md)**

    Any tasks that previously required only the admin role now require the playbook.admin role instead.

-   **[ServiceNow product tiers](../../intelligent-experiences/ai-native-sku-overview.md)**

    The ServiceNow AI Platform now brings you a new AI experience with three licensing tiers available:

    -   Foundation: AI basics to deliver insights
    -   Advanced: AI to boost productivity across relevant use cases
    -   Prime: Act autonomously with all AI assets, and create your own
    Depending on your license, you will have access to certain application features, generative AI skills, agentic workflows, and AI agents.
