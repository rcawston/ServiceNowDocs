he ServiceNow® Source-to-Pay Operations extends its capabilities by integrating with third-party applications. The Source-to-Pay Operations integration with SAP, Oracle EBS, Coupa, SAP Ariba, and Oracle Financial Cloud are new applications in the Australia release.

## Important information for upgrading Source-to-Pay Operations Integration with third-party apps to Australia

Administrators must manually execute this job outside of business hours after the upgrade is complete.
