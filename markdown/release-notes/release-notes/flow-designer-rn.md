# Flows, Subflows, and Actions release notes

The ServiceNow® Workflow Studio flows, subflows, and actions application enables process analysts to automate work without having to code and to build multiple-step flows from reusable components. Workflow Studio flows, subflows, and actions were enhanced and updated in the Australia release.

## Workflow Studio flows, subflows, and actions highlights for the Australia release

-   Compare two flow histories to see what content was added, removed, and updated.
-   Summarize flow execution details to identify errors and suggest potential fixes.
-   Test conversation-enabled actions and subflows from a conversation.
-   Use an AI agent from a flow.

See [Exploring flows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/exploring-flows.md), [Exploring subflows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/exploring-subflows.md), and [Exploring actions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/exploring-actions.md) for more information.

**Important:** Workflow Studio is available in the ServiceNow Store. For details, see the "Activation information" section of these release notes.

## Important information for upgrading Workflow Studio flows, subflows, and actions to Australia

An earlier version of the save as you go feature was released and withdrawn from the Washington DC release. If you're upgrading from the Washington DC release, you might have manually turned off the save as you go features by setting a system property. To restore the save as you go features, see [Restore save as you go functionality](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/restore-save-as-you-go-functionality.md).

The Australia release introduces enhanced protections for read‑only fields across the ServiceNow AI Platform®. These changes include a new “read\_only\_option” field with granular control levels, including “strict\_read\_only” and “client\_script\_modifiable". The changes occur in the back end and maintain backward‑compatible behavior. This update helps strengthen your instance security while preserving the flexibility you need. Refer to [KB2718122](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2718122) for additional technical details on how to identify affected fields and adjust their settings. For more information about granular read-only security options, see [Configuring read-only security options](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/table-administration-and-data-management/read-only-option.md).

    Test a conversational action to verify it responds correctly to user inputs and performs the expected operations before deploying it in production.

-   **[Test conversational subflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/test-conversational-subflow.md)**

    Test a conversational subflow to verify it responds correctly to user inputs and performs the expected operations before deploying it in production.

-   **[Use an AI agent action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/use-an-ai-agent-action.md)**

    Use flow data to run an AI agent and configure the expected agent output for use later in the flow.
