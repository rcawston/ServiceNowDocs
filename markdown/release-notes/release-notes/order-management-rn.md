# Order Management release notes

The ServiceNow® Order Management application enables you to capture, manage, and fulfill product and service orders from enterprise customers. Order Management was enhanced and updated in the Australia release.

## Order Management highlights for the Australia release

-   Enable agents and customers to make faster, more confident decisions on orders by instantly seeing the impact of price and quantity changes, ensuring clarity on what's owed for every update.
-   Improve order approval accuracy by validating contract start and end dates and terms for recurring and entitlement orders, while preventing contract dates from being set on one-time orders. This helps orders process correctly the first and contract obligations to be properly tracked.
-   Enhance the Order management \(OM\) integration with Strategic Portfolio Management \(SPM\) for in-flight orders to support projects for site and maintain program project and sub-project hierarchy.
-   Enable visibility into all entities involved in a deal by viewing billing, shipping, entitlement, and partner details on the customer order.

See [Order management](../../order-management/explore-order-management.md) for more information.

**Important:** Order Management is available in the ServiceNow Store. For details, see the "Activation information" section of these release notes.

## New in the Australia release

-   **[Delta pricing on orders](../../order-management/net-pricing-sp-contracts.md)**

    Calculate pricing and quantity changes during MACD activities and renewals by deriving deltas from existing products, contracts, or purchases. This improves accuracy when processing order modifications.

    -   Defaults contract type and contract line type when empty, based on the order and line actions being performed.
    -   Adds delta pricing–related header and line fields, along with pricing adjustment rule identifiers and conditions, and supports mapping these fields across order, product instance, and order copy flows.
-   **[Price and quantity ramps on order line items](../../order-management/defining-products-with-ramps.md)**

    View price and quantity ramps directly on order line items to model planned changes over time within a single order, providing visibility into pricing changes without managing multiple orders. For more information, see the [Product Catalog Management and Pricing Management release notes](product-catalog-pricing-management-rn.md)

-   **[Manage order updates with Now Assist](../../order-management/bulk-update-order-lines-with-now-assist.md)**

    Use a conversational AI assistant to improve order triage and resolution. The assistant understands order context and supports guided actions such as updating shipping addresses and quantities across order line items.

-   **[Customer entities on Order](../../order-management/som-create-product-order.md)**

    Capture Deal Type \(Direct or Indirect\) and Route to Market on every order to ensure the right parties are assigned, and deal structure is consistent from quote through to order.


## Changed in this release

-   **[Managing inflight order for site projects](../../order-management/inflight-offering-somt.md)**

    Use the OM integration with SPM for in-flight orders to support projects for site and maintain program project and sub-project hierarchy.
