# Field Service Management release notes

The ServiceNow® Field Service Management \(FSM\) application enables your organization to efficiently manage Field Service operations including work order dispatch, scheduling, and mobile workforce enablement. Field Service Management was enhanced and updated in the Australia release.

## Field Service Management highlights for the Australia release

-   Increase productivity by Field Service Managers, who can do their work from anywhere on their mobile device with Field Service Manager Mobile.
-   Allow overbooking in priority cases, consider holidays at the territory level, enable flexible sourcing for work and travel times, and consider task dependencies when scheduling or rescheduling appointments through advanced lead-time management.
-   Determine appointment availability without specific contact or location information by using territory and demand channel mapping through APIs.
-   View run summaries in Schedule Optimization to understand what was evaluated during scheduling, including objectives, constraints, travel mode, and assignment outcomes.
-   Review the Field Service Management features and activation plugins now available through the ServiceNow Store application. For more details, see the "Changed in the Release" section.

See [Field Service Management](../../field-service-management/fsm-application-landing-page.md) for more information.

## New in the Australia release

-   **[Dispatcher Workspace](../../field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/using-dispatcher-workspace.md)**

    [Dispatcher Workspace](../../field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/using-dispatcher-workspace.md) now enables you to perform the following tasks:

    -   Show multiple time zones on the map in Dispatcher Workspace with a segmented time indicator to see which time zone each Field Service technician is in. For more information, see [Time zones in Dispatcher Workspace](../../field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/time-zones-dispatcher.md).
    -   Quickly see a work order task in the task panel and find it on the calendar rather than having to search through multiple days. For more information, see [Open tasks from the task list](../../field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/open-task-platform-list.md).
    -   See live traffic on the map in Dispatcher Workspace. For more information, see [Show map overlays in Dispatcher Workspace](../../field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/map-overlay-dispatcher.md).
    -   Flag multiple tasks at once. For more information, see [Flag or unflag tasks from the list](../../field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/flag-task-list-workspace.md).
    -   Quickly find tasks in the calendar from the task list. For more information, see [Flag or unflag tasks from the list](../../field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/flag-task-list-workspace.md).
    -   View analytics, including the number of technicians without a work schedule or valid location. For more information, see [Scheduling Health dashboard](../../field-service-management/scheduling-health-dashboard.md).
    -   Show an overtime indicator on the calendar to visually see which technicians have overtime tasks. For more information, see [Show overtime indicator](../../field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/dispatcher-wrkspc-settings.md).
    -   Control the size of the cells on the calendar to see shorter tasks more easily. For more information, see [Zoom in or out on the calendar](../../field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/calendar-zoom-dispatcher.md).
-   **[Field Service Manager Mobile](../../field-service-management/work-order-management/manager-mobile-app.md)**

    Field Service Managers can do their work from anywhere on their mobile device, including the following tasks:

    -   [Manage Field Service technicians from Field Service Manager mobile](../../field-service-management/work-order-management/mange-agents-mobile.md)
    -   [Create a work order task](../../field-service-management/work-order-management/create-task-manager-mobile.md)
    -   [Create a personal event](../../field-service-management/work-order-management/event-manager-mobile.md)
    -   [View analytics from Field Service Manager Mobile](../../field-service-management/work-order-management/view-analytics-manager.md)
-   **[Locations on personal events](../../field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/create-personal-event.md)**

    See locations for personal events regardless of where they're created in Field Service Management applications including Dispatcher Workspace and Field Service Manager Mobile.

-   **[Completing work on the ServiceNow Agent mobile application](../../field-service-management/work-order-management/Use-mobile-app-fsm.md)**
    -   Generate work summary reports and capture signatures in them at the work order task level along with the existing work order level. Additionally, you can view responses and score information for the smart assessment questionnaires in the work summary report.
    -   Perform asset audits for the technician's personal stockroom to verify and reconcile assets between a physical stockroom and the data on the ServiceNow instance.
-   **[Respond to a reviewed work order task](../../field-service-management/work-order-management/close-wo-wot-mobile.md)**

    View and resubmit smart assessment questionnaire responses that need additional information, enabling more informed and timely corrections of responses from job sites.

-   **[Schedule Optimization](../../field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/schedule-optimization-engine.md)**

    Enhance scheduling accuracy and performance with [Schedule Optimization](../../field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/schedule-optimization-engine.md)

    -   View comprehensive details for all optimization runs to quickly identify issues. Access standardized information about run status, included tasks and qualifiers, unassigned tasks with explanations, and the objectives and constraints applied during each optimization.
    -   Manage integrations more easily by configuring options to enable or disable third-party map providers beyond the default provider.
    -   Leverage all available trainers to reduce processing time and accelerate end-to-end scheduling for high-volume scenarios by splitting qualifiers into non-overlapping sets and running multiple optimization jobs in parallel.
    -   Improve scheduling accuracy by introducing a **Window End Buffer Duration** field on the Work Order task record that enables you to configure a buffer duration that extends optimization beyond the defined window end so tasks are retained in the schedule.
    -   Ensure only relevant tasks are processed by removing intraday events that don't meet specified criteria from both scheduled and prioritized optimization runs.
    -   Improve optimization control by applying matching rules to intraday events by accessing them in the **Table** field on Matching Rules.
    -   Reduce processing time for high-volume scheduling by splitting qualifiers into non-overlapping groups to run multiple optimization jobs in parallel across available trainers. View how qualifiers are grouped using the **Job Distribution** column in both batch and intraday runs.
-   **[Appointment Booking](../../field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/appointment-booking-administer.md)**

    Use [Appointment Booking](../../field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/appointment-booking-administer.md) to perform the following tasks:

    -   Ensure better alignment with your operations by defining advanced lead time and cut-off logic through APIs or extension points. You can implement a custom script through an extension point based on job type, time of day, and day of week.
    -   Accommodate emergencies or priorities even if the capacity or appointment slots are full by enabling overbooking of appointments.
    -   Configure appointment slots to consider the holiday settings for a territory and display the available slots accordingly.
    -   Ensure guaranteed appointment slots by configuring availability checks to be performed at the time of slot retrieval so that any slot displayed is assured to be bookable without needing further capacity validation during the appointment booking.
    -   Ensure an accurate calculation of the duration for a task while booking an appointment by defining work and travel duration either in the appointment schedule configuration or in the schedule override configuration.
    -   Determine appointment availability using territory and demand channel mapping when contact or location details are not provided.
    -   Consider task dependencies while booking or rescheduling appointments and display the slots for the successor tasks after the estimated completion time including the defined lag time for the predecessor task.
-   **[ServiceNow product tiers](../../intelligent-experiences/ai-native-sku-overview.md)**

    The ServiceNow AI Platform now brings you a new AI experience with three licensing tiers available:

    -   Foundation: AI basics to deliver insights
    -   Advanced: AI to boost productivity across relevant use cases
    -   Prime: Act autonomously with all AI assets, and create your own
    Depending on your license, you will have access to certain application features, generative AI skills, agentic workflows, and AI agents.
