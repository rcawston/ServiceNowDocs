## New in the Australia release

[Australia Patch 2](../australia-patch-2.md)

-   **[Resume and submit invoice cases in draft state](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/resume-invoice-case-creation.md)**

    Pick up an invoice case where you left off by resuming draft invoice cases from the Business Portal. Use the Process tab on the Standard Ticket page to continue editing invoice case and invoice case line disputes, then submit for further processing.

-   **[Context-aware invoice case line list view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/invoice-case-header-list-view.md)**

    Review invoice case line details that are relevant to how your case was created. The Business Portal displays request source-aware columns in the invoice case line list view, showing specific details when a case is raised for a single invoice or when it spans multiple invoices.


[Australia Patch 1](../australia-patch-1.md)

-   **[AI-powered invoice case management for customers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/dispute-invoice-issues-now-assist.md)**

    Enable customers to report invoice disputes through an AI-powered virtual assistant on the Business Portal. Customers can describe quantity-related discrepancies through natural conversation. The assistant validates details, creates cases, and autonomously resolves eligible disputes by issuing credit notes or replacement orders or connecting customers with a human agent when needed. Interaction channels include chat and voice options.

-   **[Invoice dispute intake with voice assistant](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/now-assist-invoice-mgmt-voice-aiagent.md)**

Customers can describe discrepancies through natural speech and the assistant captures dispute details to create invoice cases or connects customers with a human agent.

-   **[Human agent handoff with context transfer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/resolve-invoice-case-now-assist-agent.md)**

    Help customers to escalate complex disputes seamlessly to a live agent. The full conversation context, including invoice details, dispute reason, and prior AI actions are transferred to the CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace, enabling live agents to continue without asking customers to repeat information.

-   **[Now Assist for invoice case resolution](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/resolve-invoice-case-now-assist-agent.md)**

    Help accelerate invoice dispute resolution by surfacing similar cases and common resolution patterns in the Now Assist panel. Agents can request help with an invoice case to view how similar disputes were resolved, reducing research time and improving consistency.

-   **[Automated email notifications for invoice cases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/now-assist-order-management-using.md)**

    Keep customers informed with automated email notifications at key points in the invoice case life cycle, including case creation confirmation, resolution details with credit note or replacement order information, and the next steps for cases requiring human review.
