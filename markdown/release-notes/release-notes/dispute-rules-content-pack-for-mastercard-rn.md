# Dispute Rules Content Pack for Mastercard release notes

See [Dispute Rules Content Pack for Mastercard](../../financial-services-operations/dispute-management/dispute-rules-content-pack-for-mastercard-landing-page.md) for more information.

**Important:** Dispute Rules Content Pack for Mastercard is available in the ServiceNow Store. For details, see the "Activation information" section of these release notes.

## Important information for upgrading Dispute Rules Content Pack for Mastercard to Australia

The Australia release adds 14 new data fields to the Authorization and Financial Transaction tables to support the new eligibility rules. The `transactionAmountLocal` field already exists in the Financial Transaction table but is being extended to the Financial Transaction Authorization table in this release. No other pre-existing fields are affected. After upgrading, confirm that the new fields are available and populated on your instance. For a full list of new fields, see New in this release.

## New in the Australia release

-   **[New data fields for Mastercard chargeback eligibility rules](../../financial-services-operations/dispute-management/dispute-rules-content-pack-for-mastercard-landing-page.md)**

    New data fields sourced from the Mastercard authorization API and Mastercard clearing API have been added to support the expanded eligibility rules. Fields sourced from the Mastercard authorization API are available on the Financial Transaction Authorization table. Fields sourced from the Mastercard clearing API are available on the Financial Transaction table.

-   **[New eligibility questionnaire questions](../../financial-services-operations/dispute-management/dispute-rules-content-pack-for-mastercard-landing-page.md)**

    New Mastercard-specific questions have been added to the chargeback eligibility questionnaire.

    For Authorization disputes \(all RC 4808 sub-categories\): A new mandatory certification statement appears in the dispute information section. It displays after the dispute amount modification reason field. Dispute agents must confirm that authorization was required for the transaction but was not properly obtained before an Authorization chargeback can proceed.

    For Consumer Dispute RC 4853 Failed Travel Merchant: Two new questions support the bond or insurance scheme reimbursement requirement:

    -   When a bond or insurance scheme exists, agents are asked what response was received from the bonding authority or insurance scheme when reimbursement was requested.
    -   When no response has been received, agents are asked to provide the date on which the reimbursement request was submitted.
