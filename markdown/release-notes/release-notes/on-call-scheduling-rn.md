# On-Call Scheduling release notes

The ServiceNow® On-Call Scheduling application enables you to verify that dedicated support team members are available to resolve issues when they occur. On-Call Scheduling was enhanced and updated in the Australia release.

## On-Call Scheduling highlights for the Australia release

-   Configure on-call schedule features using granular roles.
-   Configure a monthly roster rotation for an on-call schedule to simplify shift management.

See [On-Call Scheduling](../../it-service-management/on-call-scheduling/c_OnCallScheduling.md) for more information.

## New in the Australia release

-   **[Monthly roster rotation for an on-call schedule](../../it-service-management/on-call-scheduling/create-update-schedule-oncall.md)**

    Simplify shift management by configuring a monthly roster rotation for an on-call schedule. This option is available only for the 2024 schedule engine.

-   **[Granular role for on-call schedule configurations](../../it-service-management/on-call-scheduling/roles-assigning-oncall.md)**

    Configure on-call schedule features using the granular and specific role, sn\_on\_call\_admin. It contains sn\_trigger\_table\_cfg\_read and sn\_trigger\_table\_cfg\_write roles.
