# Operational Resilience release notes

The ServiceNow® Operational Resilience application helps organizations maintain business services during adverse events, such as pandemics, severe weather, or cyber attacks. Operational Resilience was enhanced and updated in the Australia release.

## Operational Resilience highlights for the Australia release

-   Export Digital resilience incident reporting \(DRIR\) action tasks in Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, or JSON for regulatory reporting.
-   Generate consistent, regulator-ready reports using optional currency conversion and third-party expense aggregation in Digital Operational Resilience Act \(DORA\) Register of Information reporting.
-   Leverage AI-native experience built into the product.

See [Operational Resilience](../../governance-risk-compliance/grc-opres-landing-page.md) for more information.

**Important:** Australia is available in the ServiceNow Store. For details, see the "Activation information" section of these release notes.

## Important information for upgrading Operational Resilience to Australia

Beginning with Operational Resilience release 22.0.x, the following scheduled jobs are deactivated for new installations by default:

-   **Calculate red flags for CSDM and dependencies**
-   **Update CSDM and other dependencies**

For existing installations, these jobs retain their current active or inactive state.

## New in the Australia release

-   **[Export action task reports in Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and JSON formats](../../governance-risk-compliance/work-on-action-tasks.md)**

    Export DRIR assessment action task reports in Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, or JSON format from a drop-down menu. Generate Microsoft Word documents for narrative reports, Microsoft Excel spreadsheets with structured question-answer layouts, or JSON files for system integrations.

-   **[Convert and aggregate contractual expenses to regulator-required currencies](../../governance-risk-compliance/currency-conversion-aggregation.md)**

    Standardize annual expense values during Register of Information report generation by enabling optional currency conversion and third-party total expense aggregation. The application converts contract amounts to a base currency using 32 European Central Bank \(ECB\) exchange rates based on the reference date. Administrators upload monthly rates into the system. When eligibility criteria are met, expenses across multiple contracts are aggregated by third-party providers or engagements, generating consolidated reports that comply with DORA regulatory requirements.


## UI changes

-   **[Export action updated to include Microsoft Excel and JSON formats](../../governance-risk-compliance/work-on-action-tasks.md)**

    The **Export** UI action on the action task form displays the following options: **Generate MS Word**, **Export Excel**, and **Export JSON**.

-   **[Fields added to the Create new Excel download/upload request form](../../governance-risk-compliance/create-excel-report-aggregate-expenses.md)**

    After upgrading the Digital Resilience Third-party Information Register application to version 22.0.x, the Excel download/upload request form includes the following fields for converting and aggregating contractual expenses to currencies required by regulators:

    -   **Report type**
    -   **Enable currency conversion**
    -   **Base currency**
    -   **Enable third-party total expense aggregation**
    -   **Reference date**
    -   **Date of the reporting**
    The **Type** field includes the **Plain-csv reporting package** option for generating reports in Comma-Separated Values \(CSV\) format.


## Changed in the Australia release

-   **[ServiceNow product tiers](../../intelligent-experiences/ai-native-sku-overview.md)**

    The ServiceNow AI Platform now brings you a new AI experience with three licensing tiers available:

    -   Foundation: AI basics to deliver insights
