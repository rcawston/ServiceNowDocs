# Quote Management release notes

The ServiceNow® Quote Management enables your sales agents to generate and manage sales quotes for your customers. Quote Management was enhanced and updated in the Australia release.

## Quote Management highlights for the Australia release

-   Quickly understand the financial outcome of quote changes, making it easier to review, approve, and act on updated quotes with visibility into exact amounts owed.
-   Enable sales agents to set a target outcome for a quote and let automated adjustments handle header-level discounting, removing manual trial-and-error and speeding up quote approvals.
-   Improve quote data consistency by validating contract start and end dates across quote headers, parent lines, and child lines, preventing date conflicts during updates.
-   Enable greater flexibility in managing amendment quotes by splitting active ramp segments into shorter intervals, adjusting quantities, and maintaining accurate line types throughout the quote life cycle.
-   Enhance quote approval workflows with automated reminders, escalations, override capabilities, and ad-hoc approvals for greater control and accountability throughout the approval process.
-   [Australia Patch 1](../australia-patch-1.md)Summarize a quote with Now Assist for immediate, comprehensive insights into quote details \(product, pricing, and terms\) to improve quote accuracy, help teams align, reduce manual review, catch issues early, and accelerate quote turnaround.

See [Quote Management](../../order-management/quote-management.md) for more information.

**Important:** Quote Management is available in the ServiceNow Store. For details, see the Activation information section of these release notes.

## New in the Australia release

-   **[Consolidate quotes](../../order-management/consolidate-quotes.md)**

    Maintain traceability from orders to all originating contract lines when creating orders from consolidated quotes. Additional calculated fields on order lines provide visibility into uplift values derived from consolidation rules.

-   **[Add price ramps on a quote line item](../../order-management/add-price-ramps-on-a-quote-line-item.md)**

    Enable agents to create and manage custom ramp structures with flexible segment durations. Make ramp changes across the quote life cycle, including amendments and renewals, while maintaining pricing and quantity consistency across ramp segments.

    Use the Advanced Approval Management to create approval workflows for end-to-end visibility and control of quote approvals.
