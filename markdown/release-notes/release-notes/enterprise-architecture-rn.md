# Enterprise Architecture release notes

The ServiceNow® Enterprise Architecture application unites strategic and operational teams, enabling organizations to achieve their business objectives. Enterprise Architecture was enhanced and updated in the Australia release.

## Enterprise Architecture Workspace highlights for the Australia release

[Australia Patch 2](../australia-patch-2.md)

-   Associate AI systems from AI Control Tower with business applications in the Enterprise Architecture Workspace to track AI adoption, governance status, and business context across your application portfolio. You can also associate one or more business applications when submitting an AI use case request in the Service Portal.
-   You can use the Now Assist panel to search your published TRM catalog records using natural language queries.

[Australia Patch 1](../australia-patch-1.md)

-   When you compare two versions of an Enterprise Modeling and Visualization diagram, the diagram canvas highlights the differences visually. This makes it easier to identify what has changed at a glance, without relying solely on the Now Assist change summary panel.
-   Support for models OpenAI GPT-5 mini, Claude Haiku 4.5, and Google Gemini 3.0 Flash added for any Now Assist for Enterprise Architecture \(EA\) skill.

Australia Early Availability

-   Publish a Technology Reference Model \(TRM\) catalog using the ServiceNow Knowledge Management product to easily find, adopt, and share approved technology standards through a centralized, risk‑managed TRM catalog. The published TRM catalog is accessible across the organization or beyond, as needed. You can use the Now Assist panel to search your published TRM catalog records using natural language queries.
-   Create documents for Enterprise Modeling and Visualization diagrams to publish, share, and archive diagrams together with their associated data. With a single action, you can transform diagrams into ready‑to‑use documents, reducing manual copy‑and‑paste effort. The generated documents support collaboration and editing, can be exported to PDF, and can support approval workflows for governed review and lifecycle management.
-   Add and manage labels on the relationship lines more easily in empty diagrams, hierarchy diagrams, and Business Process Modeling Notation \(BPMN\) diagrams.
-   Visually explore and analyze architecture data modeled using the Architecture Analyzer feature in the Enterprise Architecture Workspace.
-   Store and manage architectural documents, including documents generated from diagrams in the modeling tool using the Architectural Documents under Information Portfolio.
-   Explore and analyze Common Service Data Model \(CSDM\) architecture relationships directly on a visual canvas in the Enterprise Architecture Workspace. You can assess current state of an entity, understand dependencies, and share the insights with stakeholders.
-   Apply the granular level admin role changes to provide safer and more controlled approach to manage access in the Enterprise Architecture Workspace.
-   Determine the bubble size using the Overall score indicator on the Application Rationalization Bubble Chart page.
-   Generate insights for the widgets available on the Enterprise Architecture Dashboard page.
-   Generate a context-sensitive summary for business applications based on the page that you’re generating the summary from.
-   Compare any two versions of a diagram and generate a summary in the Enterprise Modeling and Visualization page.

See [Enterprise Architecture Workspace](../../application-portfolio-management/ea-workspace.md) for more information.

## New in the Australia release

[Australia Patch 2](../australia-patch-2.md)

-   **[AI systems on business applications](../../application-portfolio-management/eaw-aict.md)**

    View and manage AI systems associated with a business application from the **AI Systems** tab on a business application record in the Enterprise Architecture Workspace.
