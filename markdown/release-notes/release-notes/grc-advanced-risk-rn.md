# Advanced Risk release notes

The ServiceNow® Advanced Risk application enables you to identify, analyze, evaluate, treat, and monitor risks that could impact your organization in achieving its business objectives. Advanced Risk was enhanced and updated in the Australia release.

## Advanced Risk highlights for the Australia release

-   Assign risk event owners, issue owners, and risk event approvers based on entity fields, in addition to static user or group selection.
-   Use the Risk Suggestion AI Agent to refine and confirm risks, by providing additional context and reviewing, updating, renaming, or removing suggested risks before they’re added.
-   Use a structured workflow to draft, review, and approve control objective updates before making them active.

[Australia Patch 1](../australia-patch-1.md)

Review the updated AI experience with three licensing tiers.

See [Advanced Risk Assessment](../../governance-risk-compliance/grc-risk-management-workspace/advanced-risk-assessment.md) for more information.

**Important:** Advanced Risk is available in the ServiceNow Store. For details, see the Activation information section of these release notes.

## New in the Australia release

-   **[Risk event response template enhancements](../../governance-risk-compliance/grc-risk-management-workspace/create-risk-event-response-template.md)**

    After upgrading to version 22.0.x, users with the Risk Manager \[sn\_risk.manager\] or Risk Admin \[sn\_risk.admin\] role can configure risk event response templates using dynamic, entity‑driven assignments. These changes enable assignments to be derived from entity data alongside existing static user or group selection.

    You can select user fields defined on the entity \(such as Owner or Sub-owner\) or entity stakeholder personas when configuring:

    -   Risk event owner assignment
    -   Issue creation and assignment
    -   Risk event approvers
-   **[Risk Suggestion AI Agent enhancements](../../governance-risk-compliance/grc-common-functions/identify-risks-for-entity.md)**

    After upgrading the Now Assist for Integrated Risk Management \(IRM\) application to version 22.x, the Risk Suggestion AI Agent supports a more context‑aware and conversational workflow. After selecting risk types, you can provide additional context to refine search results, with the agent dynamically asking follow‑up questions when needed. Before adding risks to the suggested risk section, you can review and modify suggested risks by updating descriptions, renaming risks, or removing items from the list.

-   **[Control Objective workflow](../../governance-risk-compliance/grc-risk-management-workspace/create-control-objective-ws.md)**

    After upgrading to version 22.0.x, you can use a defined workflow to update control objectives. Changes can be drafted and reviewed without changing the current active version, which helps avoid unintended changes to related controls, and risk records. Only approved updates become active. The workflow also sets clear responsibility for making updates and helps keep control objective information consistent and up to date.


## Changed in this release

-   **[ServiceNow product tiers](../../intelligent-experiences/ai-native-sku-overview.md)**

    The ServiceNow AI Platform now brings you a new AI experience with three licensing tiers available:

    -   Foundation: AI basics to deliver insights
    -   Advanced: AI to boost productivity across relevant use cases
    -   Prime: Act autonomously with all AI assets, and create your own
    Depending on your license, you will have access to certain application features, generative AI skills, agentic workflows, and AI agents.
