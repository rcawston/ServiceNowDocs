# Service Exchange \(formerly Service Bridge\) release notes

The ServiceNow® Service Exchange application, formerly known as Service Bridge, enables providers and consumers to connect and track services directly between instances without having to configure and maintain custom integrations. Service Exchange was enhanced and updated in the Australia release.

## Service Exchange highlights for the Australia release

-   Service Bridge has been renamed Service Exchange.
-   Streamline data replication from consumer to provider instances with consumer outbound foundation data sync.
-   Get enhanced visibility into your instances with the Service Exchange center.
-   Reduce onboarding complexity for consumers with auto-onboarding.

See [Service Exchange](../../service-exchange/tmt-service-bridge-both-landing-page.md) for more information.

**Important:** Service Exchange is available in the ServiceNow Store. For details, see the "Activation information" section of these release notes.

## Service Exchange features

-   **[Consumer outbound FDS](../../service-exchange/service-bridge-v2-explore-foundation-data-sync.md)**

    Reduce manual effort and eliminate the need to share data externally by sharing selected foundational data types with your provider on a scheduled cadence. This data transfer supports the service life cycle by providing foundational data context for operational workflows.

-   **[Service Exchange center](../../service-exchange/se-se-center.md)**

    Detect problems early, understand connection status, and resolve issues efficiently with the Service Exchange center, a centralized interface that provides real-time visibility into scan check issues, connection health and statuses, and access to all Service Exchange scan suites. Service Exchange admins can access their respective centers through the Provider and Consumer center links in the navigation menu.

-   **[Auto-onboarding](../../service-exchange/service-bridge-v2-register.md)**

    Reduce onboarding complexity for consumers with automated onboarding. This feature autonomously manages onboarding workflows, establishes secure connections, synchronizes settings, and continuously monitors for errors to ensure reliable, efficient integrations with minimal manual effort.


## UI changes

-   **[Health dashboard](../../service-exchange/se-se-center.md)**

    The Health dashboard has been relocated to the Service Exchange Center. Access a more holistic view of system health that includes a resolution center, connection health, and built-in scan suites providing centralized visibility and faster troubleshooting of integration issues.


## Important upgrade information for Service Exchange

**Important:** Do not upgrade your ServiceNow® instance to the Australia release if you rely on Service Exchange. A known RPS issue prevents Service Exchange from functioning correctly. Proceed with the upgrade only after Australia Patch 1 becomes available.

-   Service Exchange version 2.x.x, which was first released with the Xanadu release, doesn’t support migration of Service Exchange \(Legacy\) versions.

    Service Exchange \(Legacy\) version: Before you upgrade to the Australia release, consult the [Service Exchange for Providers \(Legacy\) - Migration Utility \[KB1499823\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1499823) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base to find out how to migrate your configuration data.

-   Service Exchange version 1.x.x: When upgrading, consult the [Upgrade Guide - Service Exchange for Providers and Consumers application \(v2.x.x release\) \[KB1700387\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1700387) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base to find out how to migrate your Service Exchange applications.
-   Service Exchange version 2.x.x: New entitlements that require the latest compatibility version cannot be activated until both consumers and providers upgrade to Service Exchange version 2.x.x. New entitlements configured with a lower compatibility version can be activated. Older active entitlements continue to work but new ones can’t be activated.
-   When using Service Exchange for Providers and Service Exchange for Consumers in a single instance, you must upgrade both applications simultaneously to the same version to maintain compatibility. If the versions diverge, a scan check will report version mismatches and the Health Dashboard will show a version mismatch issue. After upgrading, run and validate the post‑upgrade scan suite to identify and resolve any post‑upgrade issues.
-   If you have upgraded to Service Exchange version 2.0.55 before upgrading the platform to the Australia release and your instance has Sales Customer Relationship Management plug-in version 1.0.4 installed, the new Deny ACLs aren't installed. After upgrading to the Australia release, select Repair to reinstall the Service Exchange application to ensure Deny ACLs are installed.
-   When you install the Service Exchange application, the Service Exchange Global script include is automatically installed or updated on the following platform versions:
    -   Yokohama
    -   Zurich
    -   Australia
