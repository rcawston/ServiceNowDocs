# Encryption release notes

The ServiceNow® Encryption Key Management application protects your data by using encryption, tightly controlled key access, National Institute of Standards and Technology \(NIST\) 800-57-based key life-cycle management, and FIPS 140-2-L3 key protection. Encryption Key Management was enhanced and updated in the Australia release.

## Encryption highlights for the Australia release

-   ManageField Encryption and Field Encryption Enterprise using the redesigned user interface.
-   Enhance data security with the newly added External Key Management Service \(EKMS\) integration, enabling you to store encryption keys outside the instance for enhanced security.

See [Encryption](../../platform-security/encryption-landing.md) for more information.

## New in the Australia release

-   **[Manage Field Encryption Enterprise with an enhanced Administration interface](../../platform-security/now-platform-encryption.md)**

    Configure encryption settings, monitor key usage, and streamline administration for Field Encryption and Field Encryption Enterprise with the following features:

    -   Simplify key rotation and policy updates.
    -   Access encryption status and audit details.
    -   Navigate improved layouts for faster configuration.
-   **[Integrate External Key Management Service \(EKMS\) with Encryption Modules](../../platform-security/ekms-external-key-management.md)**

    Configure and manage encryption keys externally through EKMS integration with an enhanced encryption framework, which enables you to:

    -   Hold encryption keys outside the instance for improved security.
    -   Perform key rotation and revocation with automated security tasks.
    -   Manage EKMS configurations and enforce the immutability of critical fields after they're active.
    -   Simplify rekeying following instance clone and restore operations.
    -   Monitor key state transitions, encrypted cache, and node-to-node communication.
    -   Access UI improvements for configuration visibility and error handling.
    -   Benefit from telemetry and performance-tested operations.

## UI changes

-   **[Field Encryption user interface changes](../../platform-security/now-platform-encryption.md)**

    The new Field Encryption and Field Encryption Enterprise UI includes updates to key rotation and policies, access to encryption status and audit details, and changes to layouts.
