# Import and Export release notes

The ServiceNow® Import and Export applications enable you to import and export data to and from the ServiceNow AI Platform. Import and Export were enhanced and updated in the Australia release.

## Import and Export highlights for the Australia release

-   Enable large exports with parallel export sets. Exporting data in parallel can enable your integrations to finish in less time and create less of an impact on other tasks.
-   Configure a separate connection alias for JDBC data sources. Configuring the connection alias separately enables you to reuse it rather than having to reconfigure it with each JDBC data source.

See [Imports](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/imports-overview-page.md) and [Exports](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/exports-overview-page.md) for more information.

## New in the Australia release

-   **[Enable large exports with parallel export sets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/system-export-sets/parallel-exports.md)**

    Export data with multiple small attachments in parallel. Exporting data in parallel can enable your integrations to finish in less time and create less of an impact on other tasks.

-   **[Use a connection alias for a JDBC data source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/system-import-sets/r_JDBCTypeDataSource.md)**

    Configure a separate connection alias for JDBC data sources. Configuring the connection alias separately enables you to reuse it rather than having to reconfigure it with each JDBC data source.


## Changed in this release

-   **The mssql-jdbc.7.4.1.jre8 jar file is no longer part of the MID Server distribution**

    If you have a JDBC data source integration that uses this jar file \(that is, any MSSQL connections\) install this jar file or the vendor recommended jar file according to KB0862383.


## Activation information

Import and Export is a ServiceNow AI Platform feature that is active by default.
