# Threat Intelligence Security Center release notes

The ServiceNow® Threat Intelligence Security Center application enables your organization to connect security and IT teams so you can respond faster and more efficiently to threats. Threat Intelligence Security Center was enhanced and updated in the Australia release.

## Threat Intelligence Security Center highlights for the Australia release

-   Introduced observable enrichment through the Have I been pwned? integration, enabling analysts to determine whether email address and domain observables appear in known data breaches and review associated breach metadata.
-   Enhanced the vulnerability schema to support additional intelligence fields such as CVSS scoring, exploit details, and remediation information and RSS feed processing with support for additional fields such as tags, taxonomies, and expiration time, and enabled linking RSS feed to related artifacts.
-   Added support for managing vulnerability intelligence in the Threat Intelligence Library, including related products, vendors, CWEs, and associated remediations, identifiers, attributes, and vendor comments.
-   Added automated tagging and MITRE-ATT&amp;CK extraction rules to apply tags, taxonomies, and associate relevant techniques. Added automated cleanup of duplicate source records generated during the aggregation process.
-   Added automated zero day vulnerability detection from RSS feeds with enhanced correlation, streamlined Security Incident Response workflows, and integrated intelligence context in Security Incident to support faster threat analysis.

See [Threat Intelligence Security Center](../../security-management/threat-intelligence-security-center/tisc-landing-page.md) for more information.

**Important:** Threat Intelligence Security Center is available in the ServiceNow Store. For details, see the "Activation information" section of these release notes.
