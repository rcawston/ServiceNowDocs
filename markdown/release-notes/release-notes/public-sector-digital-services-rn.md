**Important:** Public Sector Digital Services is available in the ServiceNow Store. For details, see the "Activation information" section of these release notes.

## Important information for upgrading Public Sector Digital Services to Australia

After the upgrade, certain public sector menus and menu items in CSM Configurable Workspace revert to their original CSM label names. You can relabel these items for public sector use by updating the labels for the Customer, Accounts, and Service Organizations UX list category records. For more details on relabeling, navigate to **All** &gt; **Constituent Service** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Guided Setup**, and select **Configurable Workspace for Public Sector Digital Services** &gt; **Customize Workspace Labels Manually**.

## New in the Australia release

-   **[Investigative Case Management](../../government-industry/psds-explore-inv-case-management.md)**

    Create an investigative case using Investigative Case Management. Investigative Case Management guides investigators through the process of organizing, tracking, and resolving investigations, ​developing case details,​ assigning investigators and team members​, and track evidence with logging and metadata. The following features are available as part of Investigative Case Management:

    -   Entity Management
    -   Evidence Management
    With Entity Management, investigators can create investigative tasks and workflows for investigative activities with automated metadata capture \(time, source, entities, classification\)​, as well as define processing with teams and attorneys and collaborate across agencies/divisions. With Evidence Management, investigators can log and triage evidence metadata \(digital, physical, testimonial\)​ and maintain an audit trail \(Chain of Custody logging\), as well as draft, review, and create reports with supporting evidence​​.

-   **Use Now Assist for Public Sector Digital Services \(PSDS\) Skills to create case narratives and screen documents**

    Complete case narratives and make refinements to investigative case records using Now Assist for PSDS Gen-AI skills. Investigators can streamline case narrative refinement byedit, adjust tone, and regenerate narrative content for clarity and completeness.

-   **Document Screening AI Skill for Social Benefits Playbook**

    Validate large volumes of uploaded documents, verify information, flag issues, and highlight key details for case agents using the Social Benefits Playbook with the Document Screening Al Skill, part of Now Assist for Public Sector Digital Services \(PSDS\).

-   **[Granular configuration admin roles](../../government-industry/roles-installed-with-public-sector-digital-services.md)**

    Several new granular admin roles enable admins to complete administrative configuration tasks on the Public Sector Digital Services platform without requiring the full admin role. These granular access roles enable a high-level administrator to define and assign custom roles that contain only the specific permissions a user needs, decreasing the number of users with full administrative power over the instance. For more information on granular admin roles, see [Granular admin roles](../../platform-security/granular-admin-roles.md).


## UI changes

-   **[Updated Coral theme](../../platform-user-interface/next-experience-theming.md)**

    The Coral theme has been improved to enhance usability across web, mobile, and portal experiences that use Next Experience and Core UI:

    -   A fully overhauled color system for smoother gradients and better contrast.
    -   Softer outlines and more rounded components for a modern, accessible look.
    -   A significantly improved dark mode with deeper blue tones for reduced eye strain.
    -   New AI gradient styles and subtle animations to highlight intelligent features.
    -   Smarter focus behavior that reduces visual clutter for mouse users.
-   **[Enhancements to Constituent Service Portals](../../government-industry/portals-psds-exploring.md)**

    UI Enhancements have been made to all Public Sector Digital Services constituent portals by replacing legacy widgets \(for example, portal banners, data lists\) with standardized, CSM Configurable Widgets and components. The update verifies backward compatibility, migration guidance, usage analytics, and provide training for admins, and also enables dynamic data rendering, and better filtering across service flows.
