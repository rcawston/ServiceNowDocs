# Now Assist release notes

The ServiceNow® Now Assist experience brings generative AI to your organization. You can improve productivity and efficiency by delivering better self-service, recommending actions, delivering answers, and providing your users with AI Search. Now Assist was enhanced and updated in the Australia release.

## Now Assist highlights for the Australia release

-   **[Merge duplicate articles](../../servicenow-platform/now-assist-in-knowledge-management/merge-duplicate-articles.md)**

    Merge selected duplicate knowledge articles into a new consolidated article using Now Assist in Knowledge Management. The merge preserves references to source articles and helps maintain a clean, high‑quality knowledge base.


**Important:** Now Assist is available in the ServiceNow Store. For details, see the "Activation information" section of these release notes.

## Important information for upgrading Now Assist to Australia

If you customized actions on the user interface or other items that are associated with Now Assist skills, confirm that your customized code is updated with the new skill releases. Otherwise, certain functions might not work as expected.

If you run into issues when you're upgrading a Now Assist product, see the [Issues and mitigation for Now Assist \(generative AI\) Applications and Plugin updates \[KB1637452\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1637452) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base. Log in to view the article.

The Australia release introduces enhanced protections for read‑only fields across the ServiceNow AI Platform. These changes include a new read\_only\_option field with granular control levels, including strict\_read\_onlyand client\_script\_modifiable. The changes occur in the back end and maintain backward‑compatible behavior. This update helps strengthen instance security while preserving flexibility. If you have custom client scripts that modify read‑only fields using `g_form.setValue()` or `g_form.clearValue()`, refer to the [KB2718122](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2718122) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base to identify affected fields and adjust the settings.

The existing access control lists \(ACLs\) have been updated to replace the admin role with purpose-driven granular roles within scripts or security attributes. As part of this update, the `getRoles()` API is replaced with the `hasRole()` API for authorization purposes. Additionally, all references to the admin role in the code have been substituted with the granular roles for authorization use cases. For more information, see [https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/platform-security/granular-admin-roles.html](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/platform-security/granular-admin-roles.html).
