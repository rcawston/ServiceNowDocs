## New in the Australia release

-   **[Improve search precision and contextual relevance with hybrid search](../../platform-administration/ai-search/hybrid-search-ais.md)**

    Hybrid search combines keyword-based search with semantic understanding to deliver more accurate and relevant search results, with fewer zero-result searches.

-   **[Configure AI Search as the source for Ask Now Assist suggestions](../../platform-administration/ai-search/configure-ai-search-source-ask-now-assist-suggestions.md)**

    Admins can configure the system to use AI Search as the source for Ask Now Assist suggestions in enhanced chat. Making this change activates suggestion term highlighting in Ask Now Assist and provides improvements such as wildcard searching and lemmatization for suggestions.


## UI changes

-   **[Show borders between search result cards in portal search](../../platform-administration/ai-search/show-borders-search-result-cards-portal-search.md)**

    By default, AI Search displays no borders between search result cards on the portal search results page. Administrators can enable display of borders between search result cards on the portal search results page by configuring the Faceted Search Service Portal widget.

-   **[Show borders between search result cards in global search](../../platform-administration/ai-search/show-borders-search-result-cards-global-search.md)**

    By default, AI Search displays no borders between search result cards on the global search results page. Administrators can enable display of borders between search result cards on the global search results page by configuring the search result wrapper component for the Unified Navigation app in UI Builder.


## Changed in this release

-   **[Now Assist Multi-Content Response Genius Results](../../platform-administration/ai-search/now-assist-multi-content-qna-genius-results.md)**

    If you have Now Assist in AI Search installed, Now Assist Multi-Content Response Genius Results are supported in global and workspace search. Activating Now Assist Multi-Content Response Genius Results in global or workspace search profiles overrides all other Genius Result configurations, so that global and workspace searches only display Genius Result answers from Now Assist Multi-Content Response Genius Results. Virtual Agent topic citations from Now Assist Multi-Content Response Genius Result answers in global or workspace search open the selected topic in the Now Assist panel so the user can continue their conversation on that topic.

-   **[Search Suggestions](../../platform-administration/search-suggestions/search-suggestions-overview.md)**

    Search administrators with the ais\_admin granular admin role can access all Search Suggestions tables. Assign search administrators this role to eliminate needless propagation of full admin access.

-   **[Gain insights into search behavior with a refreshed and updated Search Preview UI.](../../platform-administration/ai-search/search-preview-ui-new.md)**

    Preview search query results using settings from a search application configuration or a search profile. Choose between keyword and hybrid search modes. Display search results as individual EVAM cards or as a JSON-format search query response object, with search and syntax highlighting. Review search query behavior and results and specify search query settings with the new Summary, Genius Results, Details, and Profile admin tools.
