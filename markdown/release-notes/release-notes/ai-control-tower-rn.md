## New in the Australia release

-   **[Security &amp; privacy tab in AI Control Tower](../../intelligent-experiences/ai-control-tower/security-privacy-tab.md)**
    -   Customize the AI asset security score by weighting LLM guardrail categories that comprise the score. The score formula was changed to an average across all AI assets. The score was renamed to the AI asset security score.
    -   Measure whether your model's output or behavior potentially violates predefined LLM guardrail policies using the Data integrity incident detection chart.
    -   Review potential threats in AI agent output in Agent goal deviation, output with PII detected, and Agentic output injection detection charts.
    -   Monitor MCP server access by AI Gateway with these new charts: Clients connecting to MCP servers, authorized access attempts, and failed access attempts.
    -   The Prompt injection, Offensive content, and Sensitive data tabs have been removed and replaced by the **Access** and **Guardrails** tabs. Metrics have been reorganized into those two tabs.
    -   In **Configurations**, under **Data**, the **Data privacy** tab was renamed to **Security &amp; privacy**. In that tab, the data leak detection and anonymization section was renamed to sensitive data input and anonymization.
-   **[Data section on Configurations page](../../intelligent-experiences/ai-control-tower/data.md)**

    Enable and set up data integrity incident detection, agent goal deviation, and output screening metrics to measure the integrity of your data model and potential threats in LLM output.

-   **[Manage agentic AI system life cycles](../../intelligent-experiences/ai-control-tower/create-ai-system-assets.md)**

    Create AI system assets to track and manage the complete life cycles of your agentic AI systems, from onboarding to deployment. Gain comprehensive insight into each agentic AI system and take any necessary actions to successfully complete each life-cycle stage. By managing the life cycles of your agentic AI systems, you can extend their lifespans, reduce downtime, and optimize licensing costs.

-   **[Define the use and purpose of an AI system](../../intelligent-experiences/ai-control-tower/create-ai-system-assets.md)**

    Specify the intended use and purpose of an AI system. Provide insight into who is using the AI system, what the AI system is being used for, and how the AI system works and provides value. This information can help you determine the benefits and risks that are associated with the AI system. For more information on classifying AI systems based on regulatory risk at intake by applying a configured Risk Assessment Methodology \(RAM\), see [AI Risk and Compliance release notes](grc-ai-risk-and-compliance-rn.md) and [Assessment templates and risk assessment methodologies](../../governance-risk-compliance/ai-risk-management/assessment-templates-rams.md).

-   **[Associate additional related AI asset types with AI systems](../../intelligent-experiences/ai-control-tower/create-ai-system-assets.md)**

    Associate the following additional related AI asset types with your AI systems:

    -   If an AI system has an Asset type of Generative AI or Agentic AI, you can associate it with any of its supported components or subsystems.
    -   If an AI system has an Asset type of Agentic AI, you can associate it with any of its integrated AI tools.
-   **[Create change and offboarding requests for additional AI asset types](../../intelligent-experiences/ai-control-tower/creating-ai-asset-requests.md)**

    Create change requests for the following additional AI asset types:

    -   AI systems with an Asset type of Agentic AI
    -   Datasets
    In addition, create offboarding requests for the following additional AI asset types:

    -   AI systems with an Asset type of Agentic AI
    -   AI models
    -   Datasets
    -   MCP servers
-   **[ServiceNow product tiers](../../intelligent-experiences/ai-native-sku-overview.md)**

    The ServiceNow AI Platform now brings you a new AI experience with three licensing tiers available:

    -   Foundation: AI basics to deliver insights
    -   Advanced: AI to boost productivity across relevant use cases
    -   Prime: Act autonomously with all AI assets, and create your own
