# Data Management for CSM release notes

The ServiceNow® Data Management for Customer Service Management \(CSM\) application enables you to organize and manage the data for both your internal users and external customers. Data Management for CSM was enhanced and updated in the Australia release.

## Data Management highlights for the Australia release

-   Implement granular administrative roles across the Customer Data Foundation \(CDF\) for better access control over user permissions and data.
-   Support unified user modeling with Contact as Consumer functionality, enabling the user to function as both a business-to-business \(B2B\) and a business-to-consumer \(B2C\).
-   Migrate the Household \(com.snc.household\) plugin to ServiceNow Store for improved packaging and deployment flexibility.
-   Renamed Service Model Foundation entities for clarity and consistency. Update any configurations, scripts, or integrations that reference these entities.
-   Enable billing account support on Sold Products to give agents instant financial context, accelerate billing case resolution, and improve billing accuracy and transparency.

See [Data management for Customer Service Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-data-management.md) feature for more information.

**Important:** Business Location and Install Base Management are available in the ServiceNow Store. For details, see the "Activation information" section of these release notes.

## New in the Australia release

-   **[Configuring a contact as a consumer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/configuring-a-contact-as-a-unified-consumer.md)**

    Model a single user who functions as both a contact and a consumer within your customer data structure. This capability improves administrative efficiency by reducing the overhead of creating and maintaining multiple user records for the same individual. It also provides a unified experience, eliminating the need to switch logins across different personas.

-   **[Granular administrative roles for Customer Data Foundation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/customer-data.md)**

    Implemented administrative roles that provide fine-grained access control across CDF. These roles can be assigned to administrators and other personas based on job functions and security requirements. It includes the following capabilities:

    -   Added 25 admin roles with specific read, write, create, and delete permissions.
    -   Updated Before you begin sections across all Customer Data Foundation configuration topics with role prerequisites.
    -   Improved security compliance through role-based access segregation.
-   **[New fields in the Customer Account table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/customer-data.md)**

    Added the following fields to the Customer Account \(customer\_account\) table to improve business identification and record management:

    -   DUNS Number: Store the Data Universal Numbering System \(DUNS\) identifier for business accounts to support data enrichment and third-party integrations.
    -   Active: Indicates whether an account record is active for filtering and workflow purposes.
-   **[Description field added Customer Data Foundation configuration tables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-cust-access-mgmt-tables.md)**

    Added a Description field to the following Customer Data Foundation \(CDF\) configuration tables to capture additional details about each record:

    -   Related Party Configuration \[sn\_customerservice\_related\_party\_configuration\] table
    -   Responsibility Definition \[sn\_customerservice\_responsibility\_def\] table
    -   Responsibility Access Configuration \[sn\_customerservice\_responsibility\_access\_config\] table
-   **[Billing accounts data model enhancements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/add-related-parties-to-a-billing-account.md)**

    Grant contacts and consumers access to billing accounts through the related parties data model, using out of base system responsibilities and roles.

-   **[Service Model Foundation Granular admin roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/granular-admin-roles.md)**

    Added new granular admin roles to enable targeted permission assignments based on functional responsibilities, replacing broad admin access.

-   **[Add related parties to an install base item](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/add-related-party-install-base.md)**

    The Sold product is enhanced to support Related pricing.

-   **[Sold product form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/sold-product-form.md)**

    Use scheduled jobs to update the state of the Sold product based on start and end dates. Ensure that sold products follow clear start and end dates with automatic state updates, giving customers fair access, predictable billing, and reducing errors through accurate lifecycle management and delta pricing.

-   **[Sold product form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/sold-product-form.md)**

    Billing Account support on Sold Products to give agents immediate financial context, streamline billing‑related case resolution, and improve billing accuracy and transparency for customers and enterprises.

    Starting with the Australia release, the Household family plugin \(com.snc.household\) has been migrated to the ServiceNow Store as a standalone application. Any new enhancements to this application are delivered through the Household store app. This change provides improved packaging, versioning, and deployment flexibility for B2C implementations that require household relationship management.

    Updated the account code generation logic to support dynamic length scalability.

Administrators can resolve invalid insert errors by clearing the system property to regenerate codes based on the maximum existing code.

    Added core primitives to support price and quantity ramps, enabling flexible, time‑based changes across the sold product lifecycle. The feature delivers scalable pricing aligned with usage, simplifies post-sale workflows, and improves revenue forecasting without custom scripts.

-   **[Install base data model enhancements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/create-install-base-item.md)**

    Improve traceability and product life cycle management with the **Install Base Identifier** field on the install base form. Base install base items are mapped directly to model categories to support industry-specific product configurations.

-   **[Sold product form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/sold-product-form.md)**
