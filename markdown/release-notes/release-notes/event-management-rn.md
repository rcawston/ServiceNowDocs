# Event Management release notes

The ServiceNow® Event Management application helps you to identify health issues across the datacenter on a single management console. Event Management was enhanced and updated in the Australia release.

## Event Management highlights for the Australia release

-   Streamline Event Management setup with the new AI-guided Implementation Planner, helping admins configure ITOM AIOps faster and more accurately.
-   Enable smarter alert grouping based on CMDB service relationships, with thresholds and seed prerequisites to reduce noise and improve operational efficiency.
-   Enhance alert grouping by unifying Health Log Analytics and Event Management alerts, helping you reduce noise and act on alerts with greater confidence.
-   Support OpenTelemetry \(OTel\) metrics through the MID Server API to simplify metric ingestion and enhance anomaly detection capabilities.

    The Coral theme has been improved to enhance usability across web, mobile, and portal experiences that use Next Experience and Core UI:

    -   A fully overhauled color system for smoother gradients and better contrast.
    -   Softer outlines and more rounded components for a modern, accessible look.
    -   A significantly improved dark mode with deeper blue tones for reduced eye strain.
    -   New AI gradient styles and subtle animations to highlight intelligent features.
    -   Smarter focus behavior that reduces visual clutter for mouse users.

## Deprecations

-   Alert Clustering Definitions \(ACD\) have been deprecated and fully replaced by Alert Automation in Service Operations Workspace. All existing configurations remain supported with full feature parity.
