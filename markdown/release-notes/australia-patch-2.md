## Changes in Australia Patch 2

-   **[Add the Now Assist context menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/add-nacm.md)**

    Use the NACM to enable viewers of a dashboard to generate a summary of the contents of a dashboard or dashboard tab.

-   **[Altering tables and fields using dictionary attributes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/table-administration-and-data-management/c_DictionaryAttributes.md)**

    If true, enables case and accent \(diacritic\) sensitivity for text search of the column. If false, text search of the column is case and accent insensitive. The default behavior is false. This attribute can't be set to true when i18n\_session\_language\_sortable is true on the same column. To learn more see [Set case and accent sensitivity on a per-column basis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/system-localization/sl-locale-text-match.md).

-   **[Guarded script evaluator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/scripts/guarded-script.md)**

    The guarded script evaluator enhances instance security by supporting only a restricted scripting language and detecting or rejecting untrusted scripts that use unsupported JavaScript features.

-   **[Install Live Archive](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/install-data-archiving-plugin.md)**

    Install Live Archive to archive data in object storage.

-   **[JavaScript APIs supported by guarded script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/scripts/guarded-script-allowed-apis.md)**

    Review the JavaScript APIs that guarded script supports to help you analyze scripts in the Incompatible Guarded Scripts list and either rewrite them or create an exemption for them.

-   **[Live Archive with RaptorDB Professional V2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/data-archiving-with-raptordb-professional-v2.md)**

    Live Archive \(formerly Data Archiving\) moves records and attachments to object storage, freeing up space in the primary database while keeping data accessible for compliance and reporting. This capability improves query performance and provides scalable storage for large archives.

-   **[Review and update scripts incompatible with guarded script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/scripts/review-incompatible-guarded-scripts.md)**

    Review scripts that are incompatible with guarded script and either rewrite them to use supported features or create an exemption for scripts that can't be rewritten.

-   **[Now Assist and agentic AI release notes](release-notes/now-assist-rn-landing.md)**

    For Now Assist new features and changes, see [Now Assist and agentic AI release notes](release-notes/now-assist-rn-landing.md).

-   **[Script sandbox environment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/scripts/script-sandbox-environment.md)**

    The script sandbox environment is a restricted execution context in which untrusted, client-generated scripts run on the server using one of two evaluators: the guarded script evaluator or the script sandbox evaluator.

-   **[Script sandbox evaluator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/scripts/script-sandbox.md)**

    The script sandbox evaluator helps prevent executing untrusted scripts on an instance by limiting the APIs available to scripts.

    Scripts that run in the script sandbox evaluator can use features supported by the JavaScript engine and the sandbox environment, except for certain restricted methods.

-   **[Set case and accent sensitivity on a per-column basis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/system-localization/sl-locale-text-match.md)**

    Set locale text match to provide case and accent sensitivity when searching the text of table columns. The default behavior for text searching in table columns is insensitive to case and accent \(diacritic\) variations, but you can enforce sensitivity using locale text match.

-   **[System Archive](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/c_ArchiveData.md)**

    System Archive enables you to manage table growth by moving inactive records out of primary tables into dedicated archive tables within the same instance.

-   **[Viewing all tables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/data-management-tables.md)**

    By default, the list of live tables and live archive tables is filtered to show tables over 100 MB in size.

    Review storage breakdowns across tables in a unified view. Use this data to identify which tables contain the most archived data to adjust rule conditions or schedules.

    Estimate future object storage requirements by accounting for the compression in columnar storage. Base your storage forecasts on actual object storage growth rates rather than primary database removal rates, as these metrics don't correlate directly.

Synthesized answer loading card status text isn't fully visible in a narrow viewport when non-English locale text exceeds container bounds

</td><td>

When a user performs an AI Search query in a narrow viewport \(reproducible via Chrome Responsive Design View on desktop\) on Service Portal without enhanced chat, and with the session language set to a non-English locale, the synthesized answer loading card clips overlap its content. The loading status text and any action elements within the loading card might overlap together rather than wrapping or expanding the container height. The synthesized answer and the underlying search results continue to function correctly; the issue is limited to the visual presentation of the loading card during the analysis phase. The behavior is triggered by the longer text strings used for loading status messages in non-English locales. For example, the German loading status text 'Ihre Anforderung wird analysiert' \(Analyzing your request\) is significantly longer than the English equivalent, and the loading card container does not wrap to accommodate it in a narrow viewport.

</td><td>

1.  Open an instance with ESC portal and Now Assist in AI Search with the session language set to German.
2.  Open Chrome and navigate to the AI Search page of ESC portal.
3.  Open Chrome Developer Tools and turn on 'Responsive Design' view \(toggle device toolbar\).
4.  Set the viewport to a narrow mobile width.
5.  Confirm that the instance language is set to German.
6.  Enter the search keyword 'übersicht fristen' in the search box.
7.  Submit.

 Expected behavior: The synthesized answer loading card displays the full loading status text without overlapping. The card container expands or wraps to accommodate the full text string regardless of locale or viewport width.

 Actual behavior: The synthesized answer loading card overlaps its content. The loading status text is not fully visible. The card does not expand to accommodate the longer German locale status text string in the narrow viewport.

Incorrect Dependencies showing up for an app with customizations on Install Modal

</td><td>

An intermittent UI issue occurs in the Application Manager when viewing the Install Modal for apps with customizations. The issue arises when the initially selected base version is the latest version \(4.0.0\), but the default customized version is built on an older base version \(1.0.0\). If the older base version \(1.0.0\) is available in the base version drop-down list, the base version is automatically updated, causing dependencies for the newer version \(4.0.0\) to display instead of the expected dependencies for the customized version \(1.0.0\). This affects the display of dependencies but does not impact functionality. The issue is triggered by a specific edge case involving version linking.

The EIF Listener **Source** field isn't correctly set for incoming events, and the extParam variable is inaccessible in JavaScript

</td><td>

After setting up an EIF listener, there's an issue with the **Source** field in the incoming events. Instead of displaying the EIF listener's name, the **Source** field shows either host names or IP addresses. This causes problems because users are unable to create accurate event rules. The reason is that the host names change frequently, and IP addresses can also vary over time. As a result, the user can't easily filter or group the events based on the listener's name, which is critical for event management and rule creation. In summary, the inconsistency in the **Source** field makes it difficult for the user to effectively manage their events, as the changing nature of host names and IP addresses creates complications when setting up filters and event rules.

The offline V2 sync API returns cumulative table snapshots in each execution result

</td><td>

This issue has been present since Yokohama or earlier and affects the Mobile Agent during offline-to-online sync. When a user performs multiple record edits in offline mode and then reconnects, the sync API processes each queued action and generates a RefreshedDocument per execution result. Due to the cumulative snapshot behavior, each execution result incorrectly includes the data of all previously synced records — not just the one modified in that action. This causes the response payload to grow at an N² rate: N offline edits produce N² total records across all execution results. The impact is significant. Users who perform hundreds of edits in offline mode can experience sync payloads exceeding 100MB+, leading to severe performance degradation, potential sync failures, and a poor user experience at the moment of reconnection.

</td><td>

1.  Provision an instance with Field Service Management with demo data installed.
2.  Log in to the agent app with a field agent user.

 Expected behavior: In the offline synchronize response, the **Document** &gt; **Data** &gt; **Tables** for each execution result should only contain the record that was edited.

 Actual behavior: The **Document** &gt; **Data** for each execution result contains the data for both records in each execution result.

 PRB2001375

</td><td>

The next discovery in the daisy chain is not triggered when the current discovery is cancelled

</td><td>

When discovery is cancelled, it generates two events, discovery.canceled and discovery.complete. Whenever discovery.cancelled is picked up first, triggers the next discovery. When discovery.complete is picked up first, it does not trigger the discovery as the script action 'Discovery Run Next'. With that, discovery.complete exits on the condition 'current.state == 'Canceled' or canceledEventExists. When discovery.cancelled is picked after this, 'Discovery Run Next' exits on the condition that there is already a processed discovery.complete event for this status record.

</td><td>

1.  Make a daisy chain of discovery schedules to trigger one after another.
2.  Set 'Even if canceled' to 'true'.
3.  Run discovery and cancel it.

 Notice that even though the next discovery should be triggered, it does not always happen.
