Asynchronous Message Bus \(AMB\)

A lazy load of Asynchronous Message Bus \(AMB\) messages cause an additional query for every message published

</td><td>

A performance improvement implemented in Yokohoma was designed to optimize database operations by loading the actual AMB message column from the database only when subscribers for that message exist. However, this optimization has been compromised by a request that updates the redelivery cache, which inadvertently causes the new query to be triggered for every published message, regardless of subscriber status. The intended performance benefit of selective database querying is being negated, as the system is now querying the database for all messages instead of only those with subscribers.

When the **SLO \(single logout\) URL** field is left empty in the IdP configuration, the system redirects to external\_logout\_complete with an error code slo\_error.

</td><td>

Calls to QueryBuilder from ServiceMapping return no results when executing in the new V2 mode

</td><td>

In Zurich, processes that call into Query Builder can have no results returned. There are two scenarios where this occurs. Firstly, a service CI populated via CMDB Group containing a saved query \(as constructed in Query Builder\) can have no 'svc\_ci\_assoc' records, even when rerunning the service population. However, the expected CIs will appear when viewing the CMDB Group or the saved query directly. Secondly, instances configured to use 'Zing' for Global Search don't return any CI records in the findings. These different methods both rely on the 'CMDBGroup' API, which may not return results of query execution when using the 'v2' execution mode introduced in Zurich. Instances are at risk if they use dynamic CI groups which are built using Query Builder, they're on an impacted Zurich Version, and the system property glide.cmdb.query.execution\_mode = 'v2'.

</td><td>

The 'Translated Text Synchronize' business rule goes in an infinite loop. The virtual table v\_plugin \(or any virtual table\) can refresh \(delete and insert of records\) the table upon query. Since v\_plugin has translated fields, glideRecord insert tries to insert into the sys\_translated\_text table, which runs the 'Translated Text Synchronize' business rule.

When syslog\_awa isn't configured as a rotated table, the reparenting process executes on it and its parent table syslog. Query to syslog shards are then observed, and memory is consumed as the records on these shards are stored into memory. Due to the size of it, it causes memory to become depleted.

Offline-mode payload generation has excessive memory retention, causing performance degradation due to an SG offline document job

</td><td>

The Yokohama release introduced major changes to the way in which mobile offline payloads are generated, most notably embedded forms are now transformed into redirected forms. This removes the embedded forms from list screen documents and turns them into separate documents. With that change resulted in an increase in the number of documents that are processed during offline payload generation. This number can spike to as large as twice or three times as many documents processed compared to previous releases. As such, this results in an excessive number of GlideRecord instances being retained in memory. This has been seen to cause memory issues, node restarts, and severe performance degradation for users.

A performance issue has been identified related to checkLitsItem responders and ACL \(Access Control List\) checks while creating checkListItems in Visual Task Board's cards. These issues caused delays, especially when tasks had more than 50 checklist items. This is primarily because getItemsByChecklistId\(\) is invoked every time a checklist item is added or a card is moved between lanes. It loops through all items under a checklist and performs individual ACL evaluations \(read/delete access\). These checks result in: Repeated database lookups, redundant ACL checks for the same parent checklist, and slower response times, especially when checklist items exceed 50.
