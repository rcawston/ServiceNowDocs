An AI Search dynamic filter makes two calls \(one extra call\) when filters are applied, and in the second call, additionalContext is null and doesn't return correct counts on pre-processing

When filters are set to the empty array, the additional call doesn't happen and it works as expected. The issue happens when filters are set.

1.  Implement AISDynamicFilter pre-processing.
2.  Make an AI Search call by setting filters and passing additional context.

For the second call, the additionalContext value is null even though the additionalContext is passed as parameter to AI Search API call. If filters aren't applied, then the additional call doesn't happen. It happens when filters are applied and additionalContext is null when it should not be.

Selecting the **Test** UI action for a 'SOAP Message Function' \[sys\_soap\_message\_function\] record that has a 'MID server' specified causes the platform to send a test request to the MID server, and then poll for a response from the ECC queue. The query does not pass a valid value for the filter on the response\_to= filter, and so it can bring back hundreds to millions of rows, depending on how many rows are in the ECC queue.

 Expected behavior: When a tab for a record has focus, the preview popover also appears and remains visible. Screen reader users should hear the details in the preview popover announced.

 Actual behavior: When the user navigates through the tabs, screen reader users report confusion because a record number isn't enough detail for many to remember which tab is which, and they aren't aware they are missing the preview popover details.
