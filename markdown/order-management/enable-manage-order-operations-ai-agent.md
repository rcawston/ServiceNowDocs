# Enable the manage order operations agent on the Business Portal

Activate and associate the manage order operations agent on the Business Portal so that your customers can use this agent to submit order cases autonomously using Now Assist.

## Before you begin

Activate and enable a chat assistant such as Now Assist in Virtual Agent to use in the Business Portal. For more information, see [Configuring assistants overview](../conversational-interfaces/now-assist-in-virtual-agent/configure-now-assist-va.md).

AI agents use [role masking](../intelligent-experiences/aia-role-masking.md) to determine which users can access them. Ones installed with Now Assist applications have specific roles that come included with the application. If you select **Users with specific roles** for user access, you must configure the security controls to include these roles. For the instructions to change the security controls, see [Define security controls for an AI agent](../intelligent-experiences/define-sec-controls-aia.md).

Role required: sn\_aia.admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Agent Studio** &gt; **Create and manage**.

2.  On the Manage agentic workflows and AI agents page, select the **AI agents** tab.

8.  Promote the agent to add it to the list of promoted topics.

    1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Conversational Interfaces** &gt; **Virtual Agent** &gt; **Designer**.
