# Tracking approval status and history

Monitor the progress of an approval request as it moves through the steps in an approval workflow.

## Approval workflow interface

After a requester submits an approval request, users involved in the approval process can view and track the approval request steps for the entity in the CSM Configurable Workspace. For example, in a quote approval workflow, the requesters, approvers, and users with view access can navigate to the quote and access the approval workflow interface from the Approvals tab.

The approval workflow interface provides an audit trail of each approval step, including the rule, assigned approvers, actual approvers \(for completed steps\), approval comments, and assignment and completion timestamps.
