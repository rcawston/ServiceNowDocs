# Configure order fulfillment

Order fulfillment is the process for fulfilling customer orders by using Workflow Studio.

Order fulfillment, also referred as order orchestration, defines how to coordinate the fulfillment of orders.

You can define the order fulfillment processes that you require and then configure them by performing the tasks in the following table.

|Task|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Configure subflows for order fulfillment|Subflows define the task flow for fulfillment agents to fulfill customer orders. You can copy a subflow from the base system and change your business needs. For more information on configuring subflows, see [Building Subflows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/subflows.md).|
|Configure decision tables for order fulfillment|Decision tables define the conditions for triggering the order fulfillment subflow. The Order Management for Telecommunications, Media, and Technology application uses the Order fulfillment Policy decision table. For more information on configuring decision tables, see [Decision tables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/decision-tables/decision-table.md).|
|Configure order assignment rules to route tasks to agents, based on their skill sets|For more information on assignment rules, see [Create an assignment rule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/table-administration-and-data-management/t_AssignmentModuleRule.md).|
