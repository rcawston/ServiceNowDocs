# Make emails associated through the CRM Outlook Add-in visible to agents

Configure email promotion so that emails associated with CRM records through the ServiceNow CRM for Outlook add‑in are promoted from the Staged Email \[sys\_email\_staging\] table to the Email \[sys\_email\] table, making them visible to agents in the workspace.

## Before you begin

**Note:** Configuring email promotion is required if you're on CRM Outlook Add-in application version 1.0.1.

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Log in to your ServiceNow instance.

2.  Add a promotion rule.

    1.  Set the application scope to **Global**.

    2.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **User Mailboxes** &gt; **Promotion Rules**.

    3.  Select **New**.

    4.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table-promotion-rule"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Value

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

&lt;promotion rule name&gt;

</td></tr><tr><td>

Condition

</td><td>

\(current.target\_table == "&lt;table\_name&gt;"\) &amp;&amp; !gs.nil\(current.instance\)

 For example, \(current.target\_table == "sn\_lead\_mgmt\_core\_lead"\) &amp;&amp; !gs.nil\(current.instance\)

</td></tr><tr><td>

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    5.  Select **Submit**.

3.  Create a business rule on the Staged Email \[sys\_email\_staging\] table.

    1.  Set the application scope to **Global**.

    2.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Definition** &gt; **Business Rules**.

    3.  Select **New**.

    4.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table-br-fields"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Value

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

&lt;business rule name&gt;For example, Trigger promotion rules on CRM emails.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Table

</td><td>

Staged Email \[sys\_email\_staging\]

</td></tr><tr><td>

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    5.  In the **When to run** tab, enter the following values.

        |Field|Value|
        |-----|-----|
        |When|after|
        |Insert|Selected|
        |Update|Selected|
        |Filter Conditions|\[Target\] \[changes\] AND \[Target table\] \[changes\]|

    6.  In the **Advanced** tab, add the following values to trigger email promotion processing for staged CRM emails.

        |Field|Value|
        |-----|-----|
        |Condition|sn\_crm\_outlook.CRMOutlookAddinConstants.PROMOTED\_TABLE\_LIST\[current.target\_table\] == true &amp;&amp; !gs.nil\(current.instance\) &amp;&amp; gs.nil\(current.email\)|
        |Script|gs.eventQueue\("email\_staged.read", current\);|

        This event initiates asynchronous processing for the staged email record. It triggers the promotion logic that moves emails from the staging table to the Emails \[sys\_email\] table, ensuring all staged emails are processed successfully after the UID duplication issue is resolved.

        The following image shows the Advanced tab with Condition and Script fields populated.

    7.  Select **Submit**.


## Result

When an agent associates an email with a CRM record through the Microsoft Outlook add-in, the business rule fires and promotes the email from the Staged Email \[sys\_email\_staging\] table to the Email \[sys\_email\] table. The email then appears in the Emails tab on the associated Lead, Opportunity, or Account record.
