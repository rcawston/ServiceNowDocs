# Configuring order tasks to respond to inflight revision and cancellation requests

Configure your order task records to respond to inflight order changes and cancellation requests using Workflow Studio.

The Create Order Task action contains flow actions that you use to define the order tasks for the inflight order revision and cancellation process.

To learn more about creating a flow and inflight order change processing, see:

-   [Create a flow](../build-workflows/workflow-studio/create-flow.md)
-   [Managing inflight order changes and cancellation requests](inflight-order-change-mgt-overview.md)

To see a sample Create Flow action, see the sample Change Cisco Firepower Monitoring system flow, in your demo data, which is installed with the ServiceNow AI Platform.

When you define a Create Order Task action, you can use the standard flow actions that are available in the ServiceNow AI Platform. See the following table for a list of these standard flow actions.
