# Add the Update sequence task activity to a sequence

Dynamically update the sequence task records based on predefined configuration using the Update sequence task activity while designing customer engagement sequences.

## Before you begin

The delegated developer roles must be assigned to designated users. For more information, see [Grant delegated developer permissions for managing sequences](grant-delegated-developer-permissions.md).

Role required: sn\_crm\_sequence.admin, sn\_crm\_sequence.writer

**Note:** If you're using Customer Engagement Sequences 1.0.0, then you need the playbook.admin or pd\_author role to create sequences.

## About this task

Add the Update sequence task activity with other activities in a stage or in its own stage to update the sequence task record after the previous activity or stage has run. For example, the agent accessing the workflow could skip unnecessary call attempts when a lead is successfully contacted and move directly to the tear down stage after updating the record on the parent table. This example is demonstrated in the sample Lead nurturing tele-sales sequence available with the demo data.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace**.

2.  Select the List icon ![](../../../reuse/icons/product-icons/list-outline-24.svg).

3.  Navigate to **Sequences** &gt; **All Sequences**.

4.  Select a sequence that you're creating or updating.

5.  In the sequence diagram, create a stage to add the activity.

    For more information, see [Add and configure a stage in a playbook](../build-workflows/workflow-studio/add-configure-stage.md).

6.  Within the stage, select the Add icon ![](../../../reuse/icons/product-icons/circle-plus-fill-24.svg).

7.  Open the activity picker by selecting the Add an activity icon ![](../../../reuse/icons/product-icons/square-outline-24.svg).

8.  On the Add activity screen, search for and select **Customer Engagement Sequences** &gt; **Update sequence task**.

9.  On the **Details** tab, enter a name for the activity in the **Label** field.

10. On the **Automation** tab, use the data pill picker to establish a connection between the parent table and columns to the fields listed in the following table.

<table id="table_scy_fbk_mhc"><thead><tr><th>
