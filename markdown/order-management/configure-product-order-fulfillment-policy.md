# Configure product order fulfillment policy using Decision Tables

Associate fulfillment subflows with the product specifications by using the Product Order Fulfillment Policy in Decision Tables for move order.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

Add rows to the Product Order Fulfillment Policy decision table to specify which products should go through fulfillment. Add the product fulfillment subflow to a new row in this table with the appropriate conditions​​. Conditions can be a combination of action, category, and move operation.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Decision Builder**.

2.  Select the **Product Order Fulfillment Policy** decision table.

3.  To trigger the subflow configured for move, do the following:

    1.  Select **true** in the Move Operation column.
    2.  Select **Change** in the action column.

4.  To trigger separate subflow for change and not move, do the following:

    1.  Select **Change** in action column.
    2.  Select **false** in the move operation column.
5.  Select **Save**.


## Result

A list of subflows appear in the results section. These sub flows create the fulfillment tasks for an order line item during the fulfillment process. For more information, see [Decision Builder user interface](../build-workflows/workflow-studio/decision-builder-user-interface.md).
