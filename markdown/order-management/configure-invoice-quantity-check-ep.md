# Configure the invoice quantity validation extension point

Implement the invoice quantity check extension point to enable the invoice dispute intake assistant AI agent to validate a customer's quantity dispute claim by reconciling it with delivered quantity data from your Enterprise Resource Planning \(ERP\) or inventory system.

## Before you begin

The application scope must be set to Manage Invoice Operations. You can change the application scope using the application picker ![](../../../reuse/icons/product-icons/globe-outline-24.svg) in the Unified Navigation bar.

Role required: admin

## About this task

The demo data for the Manage Invoice Operations application includes a sample implementation called `invoiceQuantityCheckDemo` as part of the `sn_inv_ops_aias.invoiceQuantityCheckEP` extension point. To enable real-world validation of quantity disputes against your external ERP system or inventory delivery records, replace the demo implementation with your own custom logic.

## Procedure

1.  Log in to the ServiceNow instance.

2.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Extension Points** &gt; **Scripted Extension Points**.

3.  Search for the `sn_inv_ops_aias.invoiceQuantityCheckEP` scripted extension point in the **API Name** field.

4.  View the sample script included in the demo data by selecting **sn\_inv\_ops\_aias.invoiceQuantityCheckEP**.

5.  Create your own implementation of the extension point by selecting the **Create implementation** related link.

6.  On the Script Include form, fill in the fields.

    For a description of the Script Include form fields, see [Script includes](../api-reference/scripts/c_ScriptIncludes.md).

7.  Override the functions in the script to implement your logic for validating the customer's quantity dispute claim.

`checkInvoiceQuantityWithInvoiceCase`

</td><td>

Placeholder function meant to be overridden. Use this placeholder to implement the logic to validate quantity disputes across multiple invoice lines associated with an invoice case.

</td><td>

Input:

```
{
    "invoiceNumber": <Invoice number of the customer invoice record>,
    "verifiedInvoiceLineDetails": <Array of invoice line details>
```

 Output:

```
{
“invoiceLineNumber”: <Invoice line number against which the dispute was raised>,
“disputedQuantity”: <Disputed quantity claimed by the customer, as available in the invoice case line>
}
```

</td></tr><tr><td>

`checkInvoiceQuantity`

</td><td>

Placeholder function meant to be overridden. Use this placeholder to implement the logic to validate a quantity dispute by reconciling the customer's claimed quantity against your ERP or inventory delivery records.

</td><td>

Input:

```
{
    "invoiceNumber": <Invoice number of the customer invoice record>,
    "invoiceLineNumber": <Invoice line number of the customer invoice line record against which the dispute was raised>,
    "userEnteredQty": <Disputed quantity claimed by the customer>
}
```

 Output:

```
{
    "invoiceLineNumber": <Invoice line number against which the dispute was raised>,
    "invoiceQty": <Actual quantity on the invoice line record>,
    "deliveredQty": <Integer representing the disputed quantity claimed
                      by the customer>,
    "qtyMatch": <Boolean; true if the customer's dispute claim is valid, false if the invoiced and claimed quantities match>,
    "isError": <Boolean; true if the API call failed, false if the API call was successful>,
    "errorMessage": <Error message string to handle failure scenarios>
}
```

</td></tr></tbody>

9.  Validate your implementation by submitting an invoice dispute from the Business Portal using the Now Assist Virtual Assistant.
