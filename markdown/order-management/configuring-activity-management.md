# Configuring Activity Management

Install and configure the necessary plugins for enabling Activity Management features.

**Important:**

To use personal email mailbox in Activity Management, you must install the User Mailbox Integration plugin \(com.glide.email.user\_mailbox.integration\) on your ServiceNow instance. For setup instructions, see [Personal corporate mailbox](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/personal-corporate-mailbox.md).

You must also install the Omnichannel Callback for Customer Service Management \(com.sn\_omnichannel\_callback\) application to enable the click-to-call feature, so agents can call customers from the touchpoint record.

## Configuring CRM Touchpoints

Install and configure the CRM Touchpoints application. It provides a unified system for capturing and tracking customer engagements for your sales and service teams while providing leadership with visibility into representative activity and engagement effectiveness.

1.  [Install CRM Touchpoints](install-crm-touchpoints.md)

    You can install the CRM Touchpoints application \(com.sn\_crm\_touchpoint\) if you have the admin role.

2.  [Create custom touchpoint types](create-custom-touchpoint-types.md)

    Create touchpoint types tailored to your sales organization's workflow to capture activities beyond the standard Discovery, Demo, and CBR types.


## Configuring CRM Outlook Add-in

Install and configure the CRM Outlook Add-in application to make the ServiceNow CRM for Outlook add-in available to your users.

1.  [Install CRM Outlook Add-in](install-crm-outlook-add-in.md)

    You can install the CRM Outlook Add-in application \(com.sn\_crm\_outlook\) if you have the admin role.

2.  [Configure CRM access from Microsoft Outlook](add-crm-outlook-add-in.md)

    Download and install the ServiceNow CRM for Outlook add-in to access and manage CRM records directly from your Outlook inbox, eliminating the need to switch between applications.

3.  [Make emails associated through the CRM Outlook Add-in visible to agents](promote-crm-outlook-emails.md)

    Configure email promotion so that emails associated with CRM records through the ServiceNow CRM for Outlook add‑in are promoted from the Staged Email \[sys\_email\_staging\] table to the Email \[sys\_email\] table, making them visible to agents in the workspace.
