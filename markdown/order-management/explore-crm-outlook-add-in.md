# CRM Outlook Add-in

The CRM Outlook Add-in helps sales teams capture email interactions into ServiceNow CRM directly from Microsoft Outlook.

## CRM Outlook Add-in overview

The CRM Outlook Add-in application packages the ServiceNow CRM for Outlook add-in, enabling sales teams to capture and log email interactions into ServiceNow CRM without having to leave Microsoft Outlook. Sales representatives can search for CRM records, associate emails with leads, contacts, opportunities, and accounts, and create new records. For high-volume email capture, administrators can configure redirect rules to route emails automatically to their ServiceNow instance without manual association. This ability eliminates context switching between applications, reduces manual data entry, and promotes consistent CRM data for better pipeline visibility and follow-up tracking.

3.  Configure email promotion so that emails associated with CRM records through the ServiceNow CRM for Outlook add‑in are promoted from the Staged Email \[sys\_email\_staging\] table to the Email \[sys\_email\] table, making them visible to agents in the workspace.
4.  A prospect submits an inquiry through the company website or sends an email directly to a sales representative.
5.  The sales representative receives the email in their Outlook inbox and opens the ServiceNow CRM for Outlook add-in.
6.  The representative searches for existing CRM records matching the sender's name, email, company, or other identifying information.
    -   If a matching record exists, the representative associates the email to the lead, contact, opportunity, or account.
    -   If no matching record exists, the representative creates a lead or contact record and associates the email to that record in one action.
