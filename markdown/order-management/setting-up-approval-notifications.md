# Notifications in Advanced Approval Management

In Advanced Approval Management, as an approval request moves through the approval process, notifications about the status of the approval request are sent automatically to approval requesters and approvers.

## Overview of approval notifications

The notification framework handles various approval scenarios in the approval process, including approvals for simple or consolidated approval requests, approval reminders, escalations, and approval overrides. The following system notifications are automatically activated with Advanced Approval Management:

-   Advanced Approval Request
-   Approval Reminder
-   Approval Escalation
-   Approval Request for Override
-   Notify approval req requester
-   Notify approval req approvers

-   **Advanced Approval Request notifications**

    The Advanced Approval Request notification informs approvers when an approval request has been submitted by a sales agent \(requester\). There are two types of approval request notifications:

    -   Simple approvals: A notification is sent to each approver when an approval request is submitted, as shown in the following example. The approver can approve or reject the approval request from the notification.

    -   Consolidated approvals: When an approver receives multiple approval requests for approvals within the same approval chain, the system can consolidate those requests into a single notification email, if your approval rules admin has turned on the email consolidation feature in your approval configuration.

        An approver can use links in the notification to go to an approval step and approve or reject from the step. Or the approver can go to the workflow entity, for example a quote, and use the approval workflow interface to accept or reject the quote.

    Both simple and consolidated approval emails are handled through a single notification definition, with different rendering logic used to generate the appropriate message format. These approval request emails can be delivered as mobile push notifications, if approvers are using the ServiceNow Mobile app, and Advanced Approval push notifications is set as a push notification channel in the notification preferences.

    **Note:** Ad-hoc approvers receive a simple approval notification. Or they can approve or reject a request from a step in the General chain in the approval workflow interface. For more information on ad-hoc approvers, see [Add approvers to an approval request](add-approver.md).

-   **Approval Reminder**

    Approval Reminder notifications are sent to approvers automatically when the **Send auto reminders** and **Reminder schedule** features are set in the approval configuration by your approval rule admin. Each reminder is a separate email and is sent at the time specified in the reminder schedule, which is triggered by a scheduled job.

    The system generates the first reminder, subsequent reminders, and a final reminder that could lead to escalation, if the escalation feature is set for the approval configuration. For details on setting approval reminders, see [Create an approval configuration](create-approval-configuration.md).

-   **Approval Request for Overrides**

    With overrides, an approval admin for the ServiceNowAI platform who also has the requester role can approve or reject an approval request on behalf of other approvers. For example, the approval admin might need to unblock an approval step when the step is no longer needed. The approval admin uses the **Override** option in the step card in the approval workflow interface.

    When an override occurs, original approvers receive a notification stating that their action is no longer required because the approval was overridden. For more information on overrides, see [Override an approver](override-approval-step.md).

-   **Notify approval request approvers**

    When changes in the state of an approval request occur, the Notify approval request notification informs approvers of changes in the approval request state, such as rejections

-   **Notify approval request requester**

    When changes in the state of an approval request occur, the Notify approval request notification informs requesters of changes in the approval request status.


## Notification prerequisites

For successful delivery of advanced approval notifications to approvers and requesters, verify that certain notification properties and notification preferences are set.

-   As an admin, do the following:
    -   Enable the email sending \(Outbound Email Configuration\) and email receiving \(Inbound Email Configuration\) properties. For information on setting these properties, see [Email properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/c_EmailProperties.md).
    -   Consider reviewing the default notifications for Advanced Approval Management by navigating to **All** &gt; **Notifications** &gt; **System Notifications** and filter the list by Advanced Approval Management.

        For example, if you want to control conditions for sending a notification, review the conditions in the When to send related list for a notification. If you want to change content in a notification, review the associated email template for the notification. To learn more, see [Email and SMS notifications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/c_EmailNotifications.md).

-   As approvers and requesters, verify that you’re receiving the default system notifications in the Advanced Approvals notification category and that the notifications are being delivered using your preferred channels.

    For example, if you're an approver and you want Advanced Approval Request notifications to be delivered as push notifications on the ServiceNow Mobile application, verify that push notifications are set up as a channel preference for the Advanced Approval Request notification.

    To learn more about managing notification categories and setting notification preferences and channels, see [Exploring preferences](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/exploring-preferences.md).
