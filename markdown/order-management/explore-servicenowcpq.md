# CPQ Configurator

The CPQ Configurator interface streamlines the process of configuring and pricing customizable products that are added to Sales Customer Relationship Management transactions.

## CPQ Configurator overview

The CPQ Configurator is an attribute-based interface embedded in Sales Customer Relationship Management workflows for opportunities, quotes, orders, and product configuration changes involving sold products and contracts. Product catalog admins use the CPQ Configurator to manage the product configuration experience, while agents and customers use the CPQ Configurator interface to configure customizable products.

-   **Product catalog admin experience**

    Product catalog admins create configurable product offerings using Product Catalog Management. After saving a configurable product, they run a synchronization process that generates an associated blueprint for the product. The blueprint contains all the product attribute values \(also called fields\), product and pricing configuration rules, product relationships, and child products that were defined for the product offering. The blueprint controls the product configuration experience for the product offering and is managed using the CPQ Configurator. When configuration is complete, catalog admins publish the product offering to a product catalog, which also deploys the corresponding blueprint for use.

-   **Agent experience**

    When agents select a configurable product from the product catalog for a Sales Customer Relationship Management transaction, for example when creating an opportunity or quote, the CPQ Configurator opens. The configurator displays the options and features that can be selected. As agents configure the product, a dynamic list of their selections with associated pricing is also displayed.

-   **Customer experience**

    When customers use self-service features, such as placing orders, and select a configurable product from the catalog, the CPQ Configurator launches in the Business Portal. The configurator displays the options and features available for the offering. As customers configure the product, a list of their selections and associated pricing updates dynamically, providing a real-time, accurate view of their customizations.

1.  If upgrading from a release before Zurich, the system admin enables the system property that runs the CPQ Configurator in Sales Customer Relationship Management applications.
2.  The product catalog admin creates and saves a configurable product offering in Product Catalog Management.
3.  The product catalog admin generates the product offering blueprint.
4.  The product catalog admin publishes the configurable product offering so that it’s available in the product catalog and also deployed as a blueprint.
5.  The agent creates a transaction, such as a quote or order in the CSM Configurable Workspace. Or a customer uses the Business Portal for a self-service transaction, for example, placing an order.
6.  The agent or customer selects a configurable product from the product catalog.
7.  The agent or customer configures the product using the CPQ Configurator.
