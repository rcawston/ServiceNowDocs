# Order management

The Order Management application streamlines the order life cycle from capture to fulfillment. It automates decomposition, enrichment, and orchestration workflows, empowering users to accelerate delivery, reduce fallouts, and manage complex orders efficiently through a unified workspace and customer portal.

## Order Management overview

Automate and streamline the complex process of capturing and fulfilling customer orders with Order Management, a central hub that connects sales, operations, and technical teams.

-   Order decomposition: Automatically break down a single, complex customer order into smaller, manageable tasks using predefine product catalogs and decomposition rules.
-   Pricing capabilities: Ensure accurate billing with dynamic price lists, pricing matrices, and adjustment features.
-   Order enrichment: Add necessary data to orders post-capture before they're decomposed.
-   Single source of truth: Establish a unified source for all order data, eliminating silos and ensuring real-time consistency for all stakeholders.
-   Jeopardy and fallout management: Proactively flag at risk orders and automate the handling of fulfillment errors to manage issues effectively.

With Telecommunications Service Management \(TSM\) or Technology Provider Service Management \(TPSM\) subscriptions, you can use workflows that help you manage your industry-specific products and services.

## Order Management users

|User|Description|

1.  Process admins create order enrichment flows, decomposition rules, order orchestration plans, and order fallout logic using Workflow Studio and decision tables. Optionally, they also install and configure Jeopardy Management.
2.  Order agent initiates the order life cycle by capturing an order in Order Management.
3.  The fulfillment agent captures additional technical information essential to fulfillment.
4.  The fulfillment manager reviews the order for accuracy and approves the order.
5.  The system creates domain orders \(product, service, and resource orders\) based on the specification relationships set in the product catalog and decomposition rules. If some of the information isn’t available when order decomposition starts, Order Management can stagger the decomposition to create certain orders using the information available at the time. Order tasks and work orders are created and assigned to the fulfillment based on the orchestration logic.
6.  Using the order timeline view and orchestration UI, the fulfillment manager monitors the order status, fallouts, and jeopardy scenarios.
7.  The fulfillment agents fulfill the order. This could involving installing products at customer sites or provisioning services.
8.  After all order tasks are complete and order is closed, the product inventory records are created, which can be used to cater to future customer requests like disconnecting, suspending, or resuming products or services. The system also creates contracts and entitlements against the sold products and services respectively.
