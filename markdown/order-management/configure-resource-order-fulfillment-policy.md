Associate fulfillment subflows with the resource specifications by using the Resource Order Fulfillment Policy in Decision Tables for move order.

## Before you begin

2.  Select the **Resource Order Fulfillment Policy** decision table.

3.  To trigger the subflow configured for move, do the following:

    1.  Select **true** in the Move Operation column.
    2.  Select **Change** in the action column.

4.  To trigger the separate subflow for change, do the following:

    1.  Select **Change** in action column.
    2.  Select **false** in the move operation column.
5.  Select **Save**.


## Result

A list of subflows appear in the results section. These sub flows create the fulfillment tasks for an order line item during the fulfillment process. For more information, see [Decision Builder user interface](../build-workflows/workflow-studio/decision-builder-user-interface.md).
