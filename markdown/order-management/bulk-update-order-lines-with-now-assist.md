# Manage order updates with Now Assist

Use Now Assist for Order Management to manage order updates, such as applying bulk changes to order line items, removing order lines, or creating an order case, without navigating between individual records.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ind\_tmt\_orm.order\_agent.

## About this task

The Order Assistant Agent is a context-aware assistant that works inside the order workspace and helps order agents perform order updates while working on a single order. In this task, you can use Now Assist for Order Management to:

-   Bulk apply a discount to all order lines.
-   Update the shipping address for all order lines.
-   Update quantity for order lines.
-   Delete order lines.
-   Create order case.

Some bulk update actions offer an undo option immediately after the change is applied. Undo is available only within the current Now Assist chat and only for supported actions, such as updating quantity or shipping address.

Bulk quantity updates apply to top-level \(parent\) order lines. Child order lines reflect the change through the parent relationship and aren’t updated directly.

The actions available in Now Assist depend on the current state of the order.
