# Revise orders

Revise order line items to update product quantity for ongoing orders.

## Before you begin

Role required: order\_approver, order\_viewer, sn\_ind\_tmt\_orm.order-fulfillment\_agent, or sn\_ind\_tmt\_orm.order\_fulfillment\_manager

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to  **Workspaces** &gt; **CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace** .

2.  Select the List icon ![](../../../reuse/icons/product-icons/list-outline-24.svg).

3.  Navigate to **Customer Orders** &gt; **All** or **Service Orders** &gt; **All** to revise a product or service order respectively.

4.  Select an order you're working with.

    **Note:** If the **PONR** option is selected, the **Revise item** button is turned off because it is too far along in the process to revise.

5.  Select the line items you want to revise from the **Line items** tab.

6.  Select **Revise item** on the confirmation pop-up that follows.

7.  Make the required revisions to the order line item and select **Update**.

    When you revise an order line item, the following actions take place:

    -   The **State** field changes to Revision in progress.
    -   The **Version** field increments to the next version number.
    -   The **Revision Operation** field is set to Update.
    -   If there are any associated order tasks, their state fields change to On Hold.

## What to do next

A designated manager must approve the order revision. To learn more, see [Review and approve order revisions or cancellation requests](review-and-approve-or-decline-order-cancellation-requests.md).
