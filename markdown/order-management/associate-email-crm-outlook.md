# Associate an email with an existing CRM record

Link an email to an existing lead, account, contact, or opportunity record directly from Microsoft Outlook. Associating emails with CRM records helps maintain a complete engagement history without having to switch between applications.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_crm\_outlook.crm\_outlook\_user

## Procedure

1.  Open an email in Microsoft Outlook.

2.  Load the Microsoft Outlook add-in by selecting **ServiceNow CRM for Outlook** from the Microsoft Outlook ribbon.

3.  If you're logged out, select **Log in** and enter your credentials.

4.  Select a tab for the record type you want to search.

    -   Leads
    -   Account
    -   Contacts
    -   More &gt; Opportunities
5.  In the **Filters** field, set filters to narrow results.

    For example, to find a lead by email address, you would set the condition **\[Email\] \[is\] \[**&lt;email address to search for&gt;**\]**.

6.  In the **Search** field, enter the search information such as a name or email address.

7.  Locate the record you want to associate and select **Associate**.

    The email is linked to the CRM record. The association appears in the record's activity history in ServiceNow CRM.

8.  Enter additional information for your selected CRM entity, and select **Save**.

    For more information about the form fields for the CRM entities, refer to the corresponding topic.
