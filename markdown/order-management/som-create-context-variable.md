# Create a custom context variable

Create custom context variables to represent product or non-product characteristics that can be used by pricing admins to apply different pricing features, such as pricing adjustments, or product catalog admins to set product offering eligibility rules.

## Before you begin

Before creating a custom variable, review the context variables available in the Context Variables \[sn\_csm\_ctxrul\_mgt\_context\_variable\] table to verify whether you need a new one. This table identifies the system-defined variables provided with Product Catalog Management and Pricing Management and also any custom variables that have been created.

For example, the system-defined context variables provided for non-product attributes include: Account, Shipping Country, Shipping City, Shipping State, Shipping Zip, Billing Country, Billing City, Billing State, Billing Zip, and Transaction Date.

Role required: admin

## About this task

As an administrator, you can create custom context variables for items such as non-product characteristics, that your pricing and product catalog administrators can use in rule matrices to control pricing features or product offering eligibility. For example, your pricing administrator might want to define pricing adjustments based on sales segment, but sales segment isn’t a system-defined context variable.

You create the variable name and define the variable type, so that the variable can be used in a decision rule for a rule matrix. After you create the variable, you must also [map the context variable to the transaction entity](som-map-variable.md), such as quote or order, from which the system retrieves the context.

## Procedure

1.  In the CSM Configurable Workspace, select the **List** ![](../../../reuse/icons/product-icons/list-outline-24.svg) view.

2.  Navigate to **Context Rule Management** &gt; **Context Variables**.

3.  In the Context Variables list, select **New**.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.

</table>5.  In the Reference Specification section, select the reference table for the context variable that defines an external ID used in the Sales CRM pricing API.

6.  Select **Save**.

    The tab \(related list\) for the **Type** that you selected in Step 4 and the **Variable Mapping** tab are displayed.

7.  Depending on the **Type** you selected, create the values for the type, then select **Save**.

    For example, in Step 4, if you selected the Choice type, select **New** in the **Choices** tab and define the choices.
