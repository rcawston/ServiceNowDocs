</table>In addition to the **State** field, the different request task states are also shown visually at the top of each task record with the process flow formatter.

**Note:** If the **State flows are enabled** option in the configuration screen is not selected, the process flow formatter is removed. If you added states to the request and task tables, those states are visible on the request form.
