# Configure Facilities Service Management

Facilities administrators can set facilities configurations to determine how the system handles daily operations.

## Before you begin

Role required: facilities\_admin

## About this task

Facilities Service Management defaults to the request-driven processing method for handling tasks. For information about both processing methods, see [Task vs. request driven processing](c_TaskVsRequestDrivenProcessing.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Facilities** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Configuration**.

    **Note:** Administrators in domains lower than the global domain can view the Configurations screen, but cannot modify the settings.

    The options on the configuration screen are arranged in a multiple-tabbed layout, as follows:

    -   The **Business Process** tab contains options for setting up the request life cycle, creating catalogs and requests, and configuring notifications.
    -   The **Assignment** tab contains options for setting up manual and auto-assignment.
    -   The **Add-ons** tab contains options for enabling the knowledge base, managed documents, and task activities.
2.  Fill in the fields on the **Business process** tab.

    **Note:** The Configuration screen contains many configuration options. An option is enabled when the switch appears green and is toggled to the right. All configuration options listed in the **Dependency** must be enabled in order for the option to be displayed.

Enable state flows

</td><td>

Enable state flows consistent with all [service management applications](c_ServiceManagement.md). If you prefer to create your own state flows using business rules, client scripts, and UI actions, disable the option. A confirmation box displays and includes a link to a help article that describes the implications of disabling state flows. It is highly recommended that you read the article before proceeding.

 If you disable state flows and save, this configuration option is removed from the screen and state flows cannot be re-enabled from the user interface.

Process life cycle

</td><td>

Select **request driven \(subtasks are optional\)** if you do not want to require tasks to fulfill requests. When the request life cycle is request driven, requests can be directly assigned to users in an assignment group. Users can still add tasks to requests. However, closing all tasks does not automatically close the request. **Note:** If the **Enable state flows** option is not selected, the process life cycle becomes**request-driven** and this field is not displayed.

**Enable state flows** is turned on.

Work notes are required to close or cancel a request or task

</td><td>

Enable if work notes are required when closing, completing, or canceling requests and tasks. If it is disabled, work notes are not needed when closing, completing, or canceling.

</td><td>

 

</td></tr><tr><td>

Copy task work notes to request

</td><td>

Enable to synchronize task work notes with the work notes on the order or request. When work notes are added in the task, the same work notes appear in the order or request.

Send a notification when a field changes for a task or request.

</td><td>

Configure notifications to be sent to specific recipients when selected fields in requests and/or tasks change. 1.  From **Table**, select **Request** or **Task**.
2.  From **Field**, select the field to use for generating notifications. When a change is made to the selected field, a notification is sent to the recipients identified.
3.  From **Recipients**, select one or more recipients
4.  If **a specific user** or **a specific group**, is selected, the user is prompted to select a user or group.
5.  To define more notifications using other fields or recipients, repeat the steps on the next line.
6.  To remove a notification, click the ![delete notification symbol](../../planning-and-policy/image/DeleteNotification.png) symbol to the right of the notification.

Auto-selection of agents for tasks requires them to have skills

</td><td>

This option determines the degree to which skills must be matched to a task when determining auto-assignment. -   Select **all** to require that an assigned agent has all the skills to perform the task. An agent who lacks one skill is eliminated.
-   Select **some** if you want agents who have most of the skills to perform the task.
-   Select **none** if you want to auto-assign agents without considering skills.

All applications use either task-driven or request-driven processes for handling tasks.
