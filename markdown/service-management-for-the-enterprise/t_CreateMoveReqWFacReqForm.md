# Create a move request with the move request form

Facilities staff members can create move requests using the move request form.

## Before you begin

Role required: facilities\_read

## About this task

Associating a CI to a move request helps your facilities team understand which services or assets are affected in a move. You can also use this form to include extra comments and work notes for the move request.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Facilities Move** &gt; **Requests** &gt; **Create New**.

2.  Fill in the fields on the form, as appropriate.

</td></tr><tr><td>

The name of the requester.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Assigned to

Select the agent to assign the request to. If you already selected an assignment group, you can only select agents who belong to that group. If email notifications are enabled on your instance, a built-in email notification automatically sends an email to this user when you save the request record.

**Note:**

-   If you selected the **Use the dispatch queue** option on the Facilities Management Configuration screen, only users with the Dispatcher and Agent roles can edit this field. If you did not select the **Use the dispatch queue** option, all users except those users with the Basic and Initiator roles can edit this field.
-   If you selected an assignment group and want to assign the work to a new user, click the reference lookup icon next to **Assigned to**, click **New**, and create a user. Be aware, however, that you must navigate to **User Administration &gt; Groups** and add the user to the assignment group before the request can be assigned.
