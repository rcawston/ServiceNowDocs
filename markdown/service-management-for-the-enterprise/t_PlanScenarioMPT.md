# Plan a move scenario

Facilities administrators create move scenarios when planning and executing large-scale moves. When people are added to the scenario, move\_detail records are created. These records contain all the information about the potential move for a specific person, such as the reference to the sys\_user, destination floor, and destination building.

## Before you begin

Role required: move\_agent or facilities\_staff

4.  Click **Submit**.

5.  On the right-side pane, on the Scenarios tab, select the campus this move applies to.
