# Legacy: Request Management - Request dashboard

Track the progress of new requests through the time they are worked on until they are closed.

**Important:**

Starting in Xanadu release, the Request Management Platform Analytics Solutions dashboards are deprecated. Users can use the [Request dashboard](../it-service-management/request.md) to view the actionable data visualizations that help in improving the business processes and practices.
