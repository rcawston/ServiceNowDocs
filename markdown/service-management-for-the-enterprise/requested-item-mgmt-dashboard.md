# Legacy: Request Management - Requested Item dashboard

Track the progress of purchase orders, transfer orders, and software assignments.

**Important:**

Starting in Xanadu release, the Request Management Platform Analytics Solutions dashboards are deprecated. Users can use the [Request dashboard](../it-service-management/request.md) to view the actionable data visualizations that help in improving the business processes and practices.

-   **Number of open requested items**

    Records on the Requested Item \[sc\_req\_item\] table opened on or before today and not closed.

    Records on the Requested Item \[sc\_req\_item\] table opened today and not closed.

-   **Number of closed requested items**

    Records on the Requested Item \[sc\_req\_item\] table closed today.

-   **Average age of open requested item**

    The result in days of the formula `[[Summed age of open requested item]] / [[Number of open requested items]] / 24`

-   **Average close time of requested items**

    The result in days of the formula `[[Summed duration of closed requested items]] / [[Number of closed requested items]] / 24`

-   **Requested items backlog growth**

    The result of the formula `[[Number of new requested items]] - [[Number of closed requested items]]`


Indicators not appearing in dashboard widgets but used in formulas:

-   **Summed age of open requested item**

    The aggregate sum of the RequestedItem.Age.Hours script. This script calculates the difference between the latest and the first time stamp for an open item request record.

-   **Summed duration of closed requested items**

    The aggregate sum of the RequestedItem.CloseTime.Hours script. This script calculates the difference between the time stamp when an item request is opened and the time stamp of when it is closed.
