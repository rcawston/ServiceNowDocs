# Request task states

Like requests, the associated request tasks follow a specific life cycle and move through a series of states, which are displayed in the **State** field on the task record.

The request task states displayed depend on the SM application, as indicated in the table.

**Note:** The **State** field on the request task record is always read-only.

<table id="table_ohw_z45_1r"><thead><tr><th>

</td><td>

 The parent request state can change to **Qualified**, for example, if all associated tasks are in **Pending Dispatch** or a later state.
