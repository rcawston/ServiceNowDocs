# Re-enable state flows

When service management state flows have been disabled, they cannot be re-enabled from the user interface.

## About this task

State flows can, however, be re-enabled by running a script for each service management application.

## Procedure

1.  For each service management application, run the following script:

    ```
    var now_GR = new GlideRecord(‘sm_config’);
     gr.get(‘name’, ‘{YOUR_APP_NAME}’); //this can be looked up by navigating to 
     the sm_config list
     gr.use_sf = true;
     gr.update();
    ```
