# Modify the banner

The banner is displayed at the top of the page and is rendered using certain system properties.

**Note:** From the San Diego release on, configure banner announcements instead of updating **glide.product.description**, which is not used when Next Experience is enabled.

For more information, see [Configure Next Experience banner announcements](next-experience-banner-announcements.md#).

-   **glide.product.image**
-   &lt;div&gt;**glide.product.name**&lt;/div&gt;
-   &lt;div&gt;**glide.product.description**&lt;/div&gt;

The DIV that contains the **glide.product.name** property is only shown if the property contains a value, otherwise, it is not used when rendering the banner. Also, the property **glide.banner.image.title** controls the tooltip that appears when the cursor is over the banner.

**Note:** The My Company record overrides the properties.

## Window title

These properties are used to set the window title as follows:

**glide.product.name** **glide.product.description**

If **glide.product.name** is blank, then the ServiceNow name is used as the product name for the window title.

## My Company

The banner text and banner image defined for the Company that a user is assigned to may be used to override the **glide.product.image** and **glide.product.description**. The banner text, if specified, is used instead of the **glide.product.description** property. The banner image, if specified, is used instead of the **glide.product.image** property.
