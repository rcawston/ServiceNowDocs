7.  If you chose to upload a brand image or brand guidelines file, generate your theme colors using AI.

    1.  Upload your brand image or brand guidelines file.

        Supported formats for image files are JPEG, JPG, PNG, and SVG with a maximum size of 20 MB. Supported formats for brand guidelines are PDF with a maximum size of 20 MB. ![Theme Creation wizard showing a brand image uploaded to generate a color palette using AI.](../image/tb-nap-wizard-upload-image.png)

    2.  Select **Generate Palette**.

    3.  Review the AI‑generated primary and secondary colors, then use the simplified preview to see where the colors appear in your instance.

    4.  Modify the palette by selecting either the Primary or Secondary tile and select the **add \(+\)** button or choose from the AI-generated supporting colors.

        **Note:** The AI detects up to eight colors from your image, with the two most dominant pre-selected as the primary and secondary. Any additional detected colors are suggested as available options that you can swap in as needed.

    6.  Select **back** to return and choose a different image or to handpick your colors.

    7.  Select **Next**.

8.  If you selected **Handpick my colors**, define your theme colors manually.

    1.  Select the Primary tile and choose your brand’s primary color from the color selector or enter a value using HEX, RGB, or HSL.

10. Select the preferred font for your text and select **Next**.

11. Select the corner shape of your components in the interface, such as the buttons, modals, and drop-down menus, and select **Next**.

12. Review your selections and make any changes, if needed.
