# Assign a Visual Task Board card to a user

Assignees represent ownership of task cards and the associated records. Each task card can have one primary assignee and multiple additional assignees.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

You can filter the visible tasks on a board to show only tasks assigned to a certain user. Assignees appear on cards as avatars.

![Task card assignees](../image/AssigneeOnCardHelsinki.png "Task card assignees")

When a card changes lanes, all the assignees receive an email notification.

For flexible and guided boards, the primary assignee corresponds to the underlying task's **Assigned to** field. For example, on a board created from the Incident table, if you add Joe Employee as the primary assignee for a card, the associated incident is assigned to Joe. Note that assignment rules on the associated table may restrict who you can make the primary assignee of a card. If you attempt to assign a task card to a user in a way that violates an assignment rule, a notification appears and the assignment does not take place.

**Note:** Assignees are not automatically granted access to the board. Only members can access the board.
