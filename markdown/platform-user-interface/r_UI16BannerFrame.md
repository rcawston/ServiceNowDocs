# System settings for the Core UI

You can define system settings to customize the Core UI for yourself. The gear icon, located within the banner frame, displays the system settings window.

The system settings are organized by tab.

**Note:** This information is applicable to the Core UI. For information about adjusting system settings with Next Experience enabled, see [Next Experience preferences](set-up-preferences-next-experience.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Home

</td><td>

Determines whether the Home module opens **Homepages** or **Dashboards**. **Important:**

The functionality found in homepages, arranging information from your instance to tell a story about your data, is found in dashboards on new instances. On upgraded instances with Next Experience enabled, users can view existing homepages if they have a direct URL, but they can't create or edit them. Responsive dashboards and Analytics Overview dashboards take over homepage functionality.

Use the [Homepage deprecation help tool](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/homepage-deprecation-help-tool.md) to convert the homepages on your instance to responsive dashboards.
