# Set the order of your workspaces in the Unified Navigation Workspaces menu

Set the order of your workspaces and control how they appear in the Unified Navigation Workspaces menu.

## Before you begin

To enable ordering of your workspaces, you must create a system property **glide.ui.next\_experience.workspace\_sorting** and set the value to **Order**. For more information, see [Add a system property](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/r_AvailableSystemProperties.md).

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  In the filter navigator field, enter `sys_ux_registry_m2m_category_list.do` and press **Enter**.

    The UX Application Category M2Ms table appears. This table is used to store the association between an application and the experience category.

2.  Select the Preview record icon ![](../image/next-exp-preview-record.png) for the workspace that you want to order.

3.  Select **Open Record** to open the UX Application Category M2M form.

4.  In the **Order** field, enter a numerical value.

    **Note:** The lowest ordered workspace appears first in the Workspaces menu.

5.  Select **Update**.
