# Log in to an instance

Each ServiceNow instance has a unique, secure web address. The base URL for each instance has the default format: `https://<instancename>.service-now.com`.

## Before you begin

Role required: none

## About this task

Users log in to the instance from a web browser. Administrators can [associate a custom URL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/authentication/custom-url.md), such as support.myurl.com, that resolves to point to instancename.service-now.com.

**Note:** ServiceNow does not support any other methodologies to associate a custom or vanity URL. If you have a custom or vanity URL associated with an instance prior to the Madrid release, contact Support.

## Procedure

1.  Enter the base URL in any web browser.

    -   If your system uses external authentication, you are automatically logged in. For example, you may log in to company services when you log in to your computer.
    -   If your system does not use external authentication, the Welcome page appears.
2.  Enter your user name and password.

3.  Select the **Remember Me** check box to remain logged in until you manually log out.

    The administrator can enable or disable this option. For more information, see [Change settings for the Remember me check box and cookie](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/authentication/c_ChSetRemMeChkbxCookie.md).

4.  Press the Enter key or click **Login**.
