# Create a default filter for list selector records

You can set a default filter to restrict which related records users can select when editing a reference field. Default filters are simple to set up but lack a dynamic filtering element, which prevents the end user from changing the default filter.

## Before you begin

Role required: personalize\_list

## About this task

A filter is used to restrict the records that are listed in the slushbucket that displays when a user clicks **Edit** in a related list.

## Procedure

1.  Right-click any column heading and select **Configure** &gt; **List Control**.

2.  Configure the List Control form to add the **Edit default filter** field, if necessary.

3.  In the **Edit default filter** field, use the condition builder to create a default filter.

4.  Select **Update**.

    When users click the **Edit** button in the related list, the list of records they can select is filtered according to the default filter.
