# Filtering on empty fields

Most filter operations do not return empty fields in their result set. You can create a filter that displays records with an empty field value in addition to records that match the initial filter conditions.

## About this task

For example, when viewing all records that are assigned to the Hardware group, to include records with an empty **Assignment group** field, complete the following steps.

## Procedure

1.  Create the filter condition **\[Assignment group\] \[is\] \[Hardware\]**.

    **Note:** This condition does not return those records where the **Assignment group** field is empty.

2.  Click **OR** next to the original filter condition.

3.  Create another filter condition of **\[Assignment group\] \[is empty\]**.

4.  Run the filter.
