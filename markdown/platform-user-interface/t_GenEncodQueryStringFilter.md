You can generate an encoded query string through a filter on any list and paste the string into a URL query or a reference qualifier.

## Before you begin

Role required: none

## Procedure

1.  Open a list of records.

    If you are in split mode in List v3, right-click the blue filter text in the left pane.

5.  Copy the query to your system clipboard.

6.  Use the query string to [Navigate to a record or module using a URL](navigate-using-url.md) or an [Reference qualifiers](../platform-administration/c_ReferenceQualifiers.md).

    When you use the CONTAINS operator on a list filter, the system translates the filter to a LIKE query. For example, if you filter for active records with numbers that contain 123, the URL is `https://InstanceName.service-now.com/incident_list.do?sysparm_query=active%3Dtrue%5EGOTOnumberLIKE123`.
