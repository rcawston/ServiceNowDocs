# SC Order Guide widget

Use this widget \(widget-sc-order-guide-v2\) to request an order guide, that is, a single service catalog request for several catalog items with a specific purpose. You can use this base system widget as-is in your portal or clone it to suit your own business needs.

Configure [order guides](../../servicenow-platform/service-catalog/c_ServiceCatalogOrderGuides.md) using the Service Catalog in the platform UI by navigating to **Service Catalog** &gt; **Catalog Definitions** &gt; **Order Guides**.

The order guide form comprises the following sections:

## Describe Needs

This section displays the following that are associated with the order guide:

-   Image
-   Description
-   Variables

## Choose Options

This section displays a list of catalog items included in the order guide based on the information provided in the **Describe Needs** section and the rule base configured for the order guide. Each catalog item is displayed with its name and description on an accordion.

Each accordion displays:

-   **Options**, if a catalog item has fields that need user inputs.

    **Note:** If the fields are mandatory, a red asterisk is displayed beside **Options**.

-   A toggle to include the catalog item in the order guide request. You can make it mandatory to include all items in the order guide request by not displaying the toggle. You can make it optional to include items in the order guide request by displaying the toggle. To display the toggle for each catalog item of the order guide, select the **Show Include Toggle \(Service Portal\)** check box while configuring the order guide. For more information, see [Create an order guide](../../servicenow-platform/service-catalog/t_CreateAnOrderGuide.md) .

    **Note:** When an item is excluded from the order guide request, the item is not editable and the corresponding mandatory field restrictions are ignored.
