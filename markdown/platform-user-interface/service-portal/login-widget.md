# Login widget

The login widget controls user access to your site. You can use this base system widget as-is in your portal or clone it to suit your own business needs.

## Using the widget

Users log in to a portal by entering their credentials in the login widget.

The widget uses credentials from the User \[sys\_user\] record. In the **User name** field, the user enters the **User ID** from their user record. In the **Password** field, the user enters the password from their user record.

The login widget by default includes a **Forgot Password?** link that enables users to reset their password using the Password Reset application. For more information about Password Reset configuration, see [Password Reset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/password-reset/password-reset-landing-page.md).

**Note:** When the user selects **Forgot Password?**, the system redirects the user to the page value specified in the **glide.security.password\_reset.uri** system property.

If you don't want to include the **Forgot Password?** link, set the **glide.security.forgot\_password.display.link** system property to false.

## External user self-registration

External user self-registration enables a large group of users to register to a ServiceNow app without the help of an administrator. Users register to the app via a link at the bottom of the login widget screen that says ""Don't have an account? Register".

For more information on external user self-registration, see [Enable external users to self-register to your ServiceNow instance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/authentication/external-user-self-registration.md).

## PIV/CAC authentication

With certificate-based authentication activated in your instance, users can register their Personal Identity Verification \(PIV\) or Common Access Card \(CAC\) card for Service Portal login.

After self-registering their PIV/CAC card, a user can log in by inserting their card into a card reader and then selecting **Login with PIV/CAC card** on the login widget.

Before a user can register their PIV/CAC card, an administrator must activate certificate-based authentication and then set up PIV/CAC authentication. For more information on this setup process, see [Personal Identity Verification \(PIV\) card or Common Access Card \(CAC\) based authentication](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/certificate-based-authentication/certificate-based-authentication.md).

For more information on how a user self-registers their PIV/CAC card, see [Register your PIV/CAC card for Service Portal login](piv-cac-login.md).

## Instance options

Use the instance options to configure the login widget for a portal page.

|Use Advanced View|Changes the widget layout. Adds the **Forgot Password?** link to the left of the **Login** button and adds field names for **User name** and **Password** instead of hint text.|
