# Define an AI Search Results Action

Configure which portal page opens when a result is selected from the list of search results.

## Before you begin

Role required: sp\_admin or admin

## About this task

This configuration is required for UXF Client Action buttons in genius results or search results cards.

**Note:** If the action is being implemented as a server script, the script is executed by the search widget. Notification messages defined in the server script are displayed.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Portal** &gt; **AI Search** &gt; **Search Results Action** and select **New**.

2.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_mfl_y4s_jnb"><thead><tr><th>

**Note:** You can find the payload fields by opening the record referenced in the **Action name** field. Then, in the Action Assignment record, open the record referenced in the **Specify client action** field. The **Payload** field in the Action Payload Definition record specifies the fields used.

-   In the next field, enter the query parameter to use in the URL.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Additional query parameters

Custom query parameters to use in addition to the payload query parameters. For example, to add `view=sp` as a query parameter, you would enter `view` and `sp` in the **Name** and **Value** fields, respectively.
