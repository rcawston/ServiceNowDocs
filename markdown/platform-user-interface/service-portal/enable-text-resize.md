# Enable text resize in your portal

Enable text resize to increase the size of your text up to 200% through your browser settings.

-   If you have a new portal or a zBoot instance, the property is set to True by default. There are no actions you need to take.
-   If you haven't upgraded to a Rome instance, the property is created, but is set to **False** by default.
