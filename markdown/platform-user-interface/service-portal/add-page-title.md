# Add dynamic titles to a page

Create variables to generate descriptive titles depending on the content loaded into a page.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

**Note:** The dynamic titles don’t apply to the knowledge article view page in the Knowledge Management Service Portal.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Portal** &gt; **Pages**.

2.  Open a page.

3.  Add one or more variables to the **Dynamic page title** field.

    Depending on the available URL parameters and the dynamic title you would like to define, you can add the following types of values:

    |Value types|Description|Example value|
    |-----------|-----------|-------------|
    |One URL parameter variable|Generates a page title using the associated record of one URL parameter.|`%first_name`|
    |More than one URL parameter variable|Generates a page title using the associated records of multiple URL parameters.|`%first_name %last_name`|
    |Static value and a URL parameter variable|Generates a page title using a static value and the associated record of a URL parameter.|`Employee: %first_name`|

    Enter the variables in the intended syntax of the title. For example, to have an employee's name and title separated by a hyphen, you would enter `%first_name - %title`. In the page title, this syntax would render as something like "Beth - System Administrator".

4.  Click the **Dynamic page variables** related list tab.

5.  Click **New** to create a new variable.

6.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    Associate a field with a URL query parameter. When the value of the query parameter is used to display content, a field from the same record is used to generate the title. You can define the field to generate the title through the **Table field** field.

<table id="table_acv_cff_51b"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

Variable to store the value. Must begin with **%** and cannot contain spaces. This value must match one of the variables defined in the **Dynamic page title** field.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Application

</td><td>

Application scope of the page. This value is read-only.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Page

</td><td>

Page to apply the dynamic variable to.

</td></tr><tr><td>

URL query parameter

</td><td>

URL parameter to indicate the record that is being displayed. You can enter any string.**Tip:** To create a URL parameter that is meaningful and easily identifiable, use a field name from the record. For example, to refer to a knowledge article, you can enter `number` to reference the article by its number.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Relevant table column

</td><td>

Table field to match the URL query parameter. For example, if you entered `number` to reference a knowledge article by its number, select **Number**. If left blank, the system uses the record sys\_id.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Table

</td><td>

The source table of the URL query parameter record.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Table field

</td><td>

Field from the table defined in the **Table** field. This field is used to generate the dynamic page title.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    If more than one dynamic page variables match a variable defined in the **Dynamic page title** field, the record with the latest Updated date is used.

    Variables with same name aren't supported and won't be created multiple times. Each variable should be unique.

    In this example, the value of the Title field in the User \[sys\_user\] table populates the page title. The `%title` variable must also be defined in the **Dynamic page title** field in the page record.

7.  Click **Submit**.


## Result

When the page loads, the record defined in the URL query parameter displays. The field defined in **Table field** determines the title of the page.
