Usage Insights for Service Portal provides views for monitoring the key performance indicators \(KPIs\) of web applications built on Service Portal. You can use these insights to optimize your portal.

For example, Usage Insights tracks when a user orders a catalog item or views a knowledge article. You can determine which items or articles are the most popular among users. For more information on user-triggered events that are tracked automatically, see [Service Portal events](sp-analytics-events.md).

-   **Note:** Usage Insights tracking is enabled for all portals by default. Enable tracking for a portal only if you previously enabled tracking for some portals but not others. For more information, see [Track Usage Insights in Service Portal](create-sp-analytics-settings.md).

-   **Note:** If you make certain key changes to portals, such as changing the sys\_id, data is not carried over and you see a different dashboard.


## Roles

The portal\_analytics\_admin and portal\_analytics\_viewer roles are installed with the Service Portal Analytics plugin \(com.glide.service-portal.analytics\).
