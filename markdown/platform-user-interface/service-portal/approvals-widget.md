# Approvals widget

Users can approve or reject items directly within Service Portal. You can use this base system widget as-is in your portal or clone it to suit your own business needs.

## Using the widget

The Approvals widget displays data from the Approvals \[sysapproval\_approver\] table. If the user has been assigned to approve a request, the approval record is displayed in the widget.

You can enable e-signature for the approvals widget to require reauthentication for your users. For more information on enabling e-signature, see [Enable e-signature for Service Portal](enable-esignature-sp.md#).
