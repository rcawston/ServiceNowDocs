# Service Status widget

The Service Status widget provides a visual representation of service availability over the past three months. You can use this base system widget as-is in your portal or clone it to suit your own business needs.

The Service Status widget displays the history of service availability for one service from the Services \[cmdb\_ci\_service\] table. The widget uses the page URL to determine which service to represent.

Each pill represents one day. Each color correlates with a type of service availability. To include additional details when you hover over a pill, such as the task number or short description, you must clone the widget and edit the server script.

|Color|Service availability|
|-----|--------------------|
|Green|No issues|
|Blue|Planned maintenance|
|Yellow|Service degradation|
|Red|Outage|
