# Create a portal

Create a portal for users to browse company resources, discover articles, and get help.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin or sp\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Portal** &gt; **Portals**, then click **New**.

2.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_xrm_byw_hw"><thead><tr><th>

Title

</td><td>

Name to define your portal. In the browser header and for bookmarks, the title appears as `<Page Title> - <Portal Title>`.

</td></tr><tr><td>

URL suffix

</td><td>

Value that appears appended to an instance URL when you access a portal. For example, if you use `sp`, the instance URL for that portal would be `<instance name>.service-now.com/sp`. Ensure that this value is unique and is not the same as any other portal. **Note:** Avoid using reserved words in your URL to prevent errors when navigating to your portal page. Avoid words such as `portal` and `cms`. Also avoid any JavaScript protected terms.

Page that users see first after they sign in.

Application scope of the portal. This field is uneditable and **Global** by default.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Theme

</td><td>

Refers to a theme in the Themes \[sp\_theme\] table that defines the style and branding for the portal. The theme is the lowest level of style configuration. Any changes made in the Branding Editor or to specific portal components \(such as widget or container CSS\) override those styles.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Quick start config

</td><td>

Schema that defines configuration items in the Branding Editor. In JSON format, you can define the fields and records used to generate your branding options.

 ```json
[{
	"tagline": {
		"table" : "sp_instance",
		"sys_id" : "34fe3d96cb20020000f8d856634c9cf4",
		"field" : "title"
	},
	"hero_background": {
		"table" : "sp_container",
		"sys_id" : "be98a8d2cb20020000f8d856634c9c63",
		"field" : "background_image"

Option to hide the portal name in the page title.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Support right-to-left languages

</td><td>

Option to mirror the direction of the portal when the session language is a right-to-left language, such as Hebrew. Selecting this option automatically generates the necessary CSS but you can also provide your own CSS for right-to-left languages that overrides the auto-generated CSS.

 To provide your own CSS for right-to-left languages, see [Create a portal theme](c_CustomCSS.md). For more information about support for right-to-left languages, see [Styling for right-to-left languages in portals](styling-right-to-left-languages.md).

    -   This is applicable only for Service Portal. For other portals, you can clone the **My Favorites** menu item.
 You may need to configure the form to add this check box.
