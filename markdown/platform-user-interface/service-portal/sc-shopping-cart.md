# SC Shopping Cart widget

The SC Shopping Cart widget \(sc-shopping-cart-v2\), used with Service Catalog, stores all your orders at one place. You can use this base system widget as-is in your portal or clone it to suit your own business needs.

-   Add items to a cart. This information is stored in the sc\_cart table.
-   Define who the items are being requested for.
-   Save specific items together as a bundle, which can be reloaded later. You can replace the cart items with the saved bundles, or add the bundles to the cart items.
