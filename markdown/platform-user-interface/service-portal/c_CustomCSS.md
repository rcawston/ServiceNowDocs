# Create a portal theme

If you need more customizations than the Branding Editor can provide, you can create your own custom theme.

Only users with an understanding of CSS should create custom themes.

1.  Navigate to **Service Portal** &gt; **Themes**, then select **New**.
2.  Complete the form fields and then from the form context menu, select **Save**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

$sp-logo-margin-x: 		15px !default;
$sp-tagline-color:		$text-color !default;
$navbar-inverse-bg: 	#3a3f51 !default;
```

 **Note:** Use the CSS variables field to define CSS variables only. Use CSS Includes to define CSS rules. As of the Madrid release, Sass and LESS can be used within CSS Includes.
