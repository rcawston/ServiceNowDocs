# Ticket Conversations widget

Record of ticket items. Users can use this widget to communicate back and forth with the fulfiller and the receiver. You can use this base system widget as-is in your portal or clone it to suit your own business needs.

The Ticket Conversations widget displays journal entries from the activity formatter of the target record. Journal entries are presented in chronological order, with the oldest entries appearing at the bottom of the widget. Entries made by the user that created the record appear on the right side of the center divider. Entries made by other users appear to the left.

The Ticket Conversations widget is intended only for tables that extend task.

Limit the number of journal entries that appears in the ticket conversation widget using the **glide.service\_portal.stream\_entry\_limit** system property. The default number is 100 on a base instance or 500 if the property is not in the System Property \[sys\_properties\] table. Change the number by navigating to **Service Portal** &gt; **Properties**, and enter the new number in the **Maximum number of stream entries displayed in Service Portal** field.
