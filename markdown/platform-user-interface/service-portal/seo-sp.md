# Improving search engine optimization for portals

Search engine optimization \(SEO\) helps portal users find the information they need and be more engaged with your portal. Adding SEO information to your public portal pages improves how external search engines index and rank pages to make them more findable.

You can add the following types of information to Service Portal pages to improve SEO:

-   Human readable keywords in URLs.
-   Meta tags that include information about the page or portal in the `<head>` section of a page.
-   Dynamic page titles that are descriptive of the page contents.
-   **hreflang** tags that specify all the available languages of a page.
-   Canonical URLs that specify which pages to index from sets of duplicate URLs.

To improve SEO for your portal further, you can also define and automatically generate XML sitemaps for search engines to index using the Sitemap Generator application.

Some portal pages load data from a record that's specified by a parameter in the URL. For these pages, you can use dynamic page variables to add meta tags, page titles, and human readable URL keywords that vary depending on the record loaded in the page.

Using a Service Catalog page as an example, the following URL includes a sys\_id parameter in addition to the page ID. Different content loads on the page depending on the value of the sys\_id parameter, which specifies a catalog item record.

`https://<instance>/sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=c3b9cbf29716cd1021983d1e6253afad`

In this example, the sys\_id is for the iPad pro catalog item. The sc\_cat\_item page has been configured to generate a dynamic title and dynamic keywords in the URL based on the **Name** field of the catalog item record.
