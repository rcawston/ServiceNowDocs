# Configure a portal header menu

Define the look and behavior of the portal header menu and assign menu items to appear in the header. The header menu is one of the primary navigation controls for Service Portal users.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

Configuring a portal header with a menu involves several steps.

## Procedure

1.  Create a header and add it to a theme.

    Until you add a theme with a header to a portal, the header menu does not display.

2.  Create a main menu with menu items and assign it to the portal.

    The main menu record is where you assign which navigation options appear in the header. For example, you can add a menu item that links to another page within your portal, such as the service catalog.


## Result

The main menu and header form a header menu when associated with a theme and a portal.

## Add a header or footer to a portal

Use the theme to add a header or footer to your portal.

### Before you begin

Role required: \(admin or none\)

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Portal** &gt; **Service Portal Configuration**.

2.  Select **Portal Tables** &gt; **Themes** and then select the theme you want to add the header or footer to.

    If you are just getting started, you can reuse the base system Stock Header or Sample Footer widgets.

4.  Select **Fixed Header** or **Fixed Footer** to lock the header or footer in one place so when users scroll up or down they remain in the same location on the page.

5.  To configure the appearance of the header, in the Service Portal configuration page, open the Branding Editor.

6.  Under the **Theme Colors** tab, use the color selectors in the Navbar section to control the colors in the header.

### What to do next

## Enable a language selector in portal headers

Allow all users to select their language preferences by enabling the language selector in your portal header.

### Before you begin

Active the languages your portal users need and configure a portal header menu. For more information, see [Activate a language](../../platform-administration/system-localization/t_ActivateALanguage.md) and [Configure a portal header menu](configure-header-menu.md#).

Role required: admin

### About this task

For all portals except the Knowledge \(/kb\), Customer Support \(/csm\), and Customer Service \(/csp\) portals, the language selector is included but turned off by default. To display the language selector in the portal header for other portals, you must enable it according to this procedure.

In portal headers, the language selector displays the current language selection of the user and a menu of languages that the user can choose from. If region grouping is enabled, languages are displayed according to the configured region groups. For more information about grouping languages, see [Create regions for language selection in portals](../../platform-administration/system-localization/create-regions.md).

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All**, and then enter `sys_properties.list` in the navigation filter.

2.  Open the **glide.sp.portals.language\_selector\_enabled** property.

3.  In the **Value** field, enter the sys\_ID of the portal to display the language selector widget.

4.  Select **Update**.


### Result

The language selector displays in the header menu for both authenticated and unauthenticated users.
