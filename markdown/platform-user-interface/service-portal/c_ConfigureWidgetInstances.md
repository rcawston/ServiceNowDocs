# Configure widget instances

Create unique instances of widgets by configuring the options for each instance.

## Before you begin

Create or edit a portal page and add widgets to it. You can also configure the existing widget instances on a base system page. For more information, see [Create and edit a page using the Service Portal Designer](t_ConfigureAPage.md#).

Role required: sp\_admin or admin

## About this task

You can have several instances of the same widget on a page, and each instance of the widget you configure remains unique. For example, each instance of the [Cool Clock widget](cool-clock-widget.md) on a page could use a different time zone.

Adding a widget to a page creates a record on the Widget Instances \[sp\_instance\] table with the following information:

-   A reference to the widget
-   A reference to the column of the page where the widget is located
-   The configuration for a widget in the form of pre-defined form fields and an **Additional Options** field in JSON format

**Note:** For widgets that do not contain any information by default, you must configure the options for their widget instances before they will appear on a portal page.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Portal** &gt; **Service Portal Configuration**.

2.  Select **Designer**.

3.  Select the page with the widget instance\(s\) you want to configure.

4.  In the Service Portal Designer, move to a widget instance and select the Edit icon \(![Edit icon](../image/WidgetEditIcon.png)\).

5.  In the instance options window, complete the fields to configure the widget instance.

    Instance options vary depending on which widget you select.

6.  Select **Save**.
