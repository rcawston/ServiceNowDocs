# Faceted Search widget

The Faceted Search widget displays search results and search facets defined for a search source. The Faceted Search widget enables end users to filter search results for a more meaningful result set.

## Using the widget

You can use facet filters to refine your search in Service Portal. For example, you can view only knowledge article search results by selecting the **Knowledge** source facet bucket. Or, to filter search results by certain knowledge categories, you can select one or more facets.

![Filter for faceted Search widget showing "email" search results with available facet filters](../image/faceted-search-widget.png "Filter for Faceted Search widget")

The available facets are dynamic, showing only field values that are included in your current search results. As you select facets, the search narrows and the number of available facets decreases. You can broaden your search by clearing an individual facet selection.

To see which facets you've selected, view the pills in the Filters panel. If you select a different source facet bucket, your other selected facets are carried over and applied to your modified search.

You can initiate a new search by entering a new search term in the typeahead search box. After you enter the new search term, the system clears your facet filter selections from the previous search. You can refine your new search by selecting new facet filters.

For more information on configuring the available facets, see [Create a facet in an AI Search application configuration](../../platform-administration/ai-search/create-facet-ais.md).
