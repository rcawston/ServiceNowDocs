# Create and edit a page using the Service Portal Designer

Create or edit a page and use layouts to organize the columns that house the widgets.

## Before you begin

Role required: sp\_admin or admin

## About this task

These steps are intended for users with little to no coding experience. The Service Portal Designer includes several layers of customization from simply adding widgets in a particular configuration on a page, to adding CSS classes.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Portal** &gt; **Service Portal Configuration**.

2.  Select **Designer**.

3.  Switch to the portal you want to design pages for by selecting the portal name in the header.

4.  From the Service Portal Designer, select a page to customize or select **Add a new page**.

5.  Under Layouts, select **Container** and drag it onto the page.

6.  Drag one of the other layouts and drop it in the container.

    This layout defines the structure of your page and the space available to drop widgets. The structure of the layout aligns with the Bootstrap grid template and adds up to 12.

7.  Use the filter to search for a widget, then drag the widget to the layout.

    ![Gif showing how to drag containers, layouts, then widgets onto a page](../image/ConfigurePage.gif "Drag containers, layouts, then widgets onto a page")

    For widgets that do not contain any information by default, you must configure the options for their widget instances before they will appear on a portal page. For more information about configuring widget instance options, see [Configure widget instances](c_ConfigureWidgetInstances.md).

8.  Edit page properties.

    1.  Select **Edit Page Properties**.

        The page record from the Pages table \[sp\_page\] opens.

    2.  Edit the form.

<table id="table_ygl_qdt_3z"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Title

</td><td>

Internal name of the page. Use the title to search for a page in the Service Portal Designer.

</td></tr><tr><td>

ID

</td><td>

A unique ID for the page. The ID is what you use to assign a page to a portal. It also determines the URL for the page, for example `https://instance name.service-now.com/doc_portal/?id=doc_page`, where doc\_page is the page ID.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Application

</td><td>

The application scope.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Public

</td><td>

Enables the page to be accessed without the need for authentication. If **Public** is selected, all users can view the page no matter the roles listed.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Draft

</td><td>

Mark a page as draft to limit user ability to view the page while you’re still creating it. Only users with the admin role can view a page in draft, all other users see a 404 page.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Roles

</td><td>

Limit user access to a page by role.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Short description

</td><td>

Describes the portal page. This field isn’t public facing.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Page Specific CSS

</td><td>

Unless a page has Page Specific CSS, the page inherits CSS from the Theme and Branding. If you need a page to look different, the Page Specific CSS overrides the inheritance from the Theme and Branding.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Dynamic page title

</td><td>

Create variables to generate descriptive titles depending on the content loaded into a page.

 For more information, see [Add dynamic titles to a page](add-page-title.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Clone Page

</td><td>

Enables you to make a copy of a page that can be modified. If you copy a base system page, a new widget instance is created for each widget on the page.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Use SEO script

</td><td>

Option to enable a script include that adds SEO tags for canonical URLs and hreflang tags.

 For more information, see [Enable SEO for localized versions of a portal page](seo-header-tags.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

SEO script

</td><td>

Script include to apply to the page. By default, the system uses the SPSEOHeaderTags script include, which includes the default implementation for the canonical URL and hreflang tags for Service Portal Analytics pages.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Human readable URL structure

</td><td>

Add human readable keywords to the page URL to improve search engine optimization \(SEO\) and click-through rates for public pages. Human readable URLs also help users understand what to expect on a page for public and non-public pages. For example, `https://<instance>/kb/en/faq/what-is-a-cookie?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0000007`.

 For more information, see [Add human readable keywords to page URLs](add-human-readable-keywords-page-urls.md).

    Use the sys\_id of the attachment as the src in the CSS. For example:

    ```
    /* fallback */
    @font-face {
      font-family: 'Material Icons';
      font-style: normal;
      font-weight: 400;
      src: url('/828b8ca8b7033010897725cbde11a9f7.iix') format('woff2');
    }
    
    .material-icons {
      font-family: 'Material Icons';
      font-weight: normal;
      font-style: normal;
      font-size: 24px;  /* Preferred icon size */
      display: inline-block;
      line-height: 1;
      text-transform: none;
      letter-spacing: normal;
      word-wrap: normal;
      white-space: nowrap;

      /* Support for Firefox. */
      -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
    
      /* Support for IE. */
      font-feature-settings: 'liga';
    }
    ```


### Result

You can select an icon from the icon set for any widget on this page. For example, in the HTML widget you can use the **Source Code** option to use an icon. For example:

`<p style="text-align: center;"><em class="material-icons">flight_land</em></p>`
