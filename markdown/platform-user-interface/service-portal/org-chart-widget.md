# Organization Chart widget

The Organization Chart widget shows employees in a tree structure relative to their manager. You can use this base system widget as-is in your portal or clone it to suit your own business needs.

## Using the widget

In the text input field, enter or select a user to see their manager and subordinates. The widget uses information from the User \[sys\_user\] record to display the organization hierarchy relative to the selected user.

Click a card to open the profile page for that user. To reconfigure the card link, change the **URL** or **Page** in the widget instance options.

You can drag individual cards to rearrange the chart.

You can zoom in or out of the chart view by clicking the magnifying glass icons or by scrolling.
