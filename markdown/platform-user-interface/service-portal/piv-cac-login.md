# Register your PIV/CAC card for Service Portal login

Register your Personal Identity Verification \(PIV\) or Common Access Card \(CAC\) card so that you can log in to your organization's portal without entering a password.

## Before you begin

To register your PIV/CAC card, an administrator must activate certificate-based authentication and then set up PIV/CAC authentication. For more information on this setup process, see [Personal Identity Verification \(PIV\) card or Common Access Card \(CAC\) based authentication](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/certificate-based-authentication/certificate-based-authentication.md).

The following task assumes that you have a card reader connected to your system.

Role required: none

## Procedure

1.  Log in to a portal using your user name and password.

2.  In the portal, open your user profile.

3.  Insert your PIV/CAC card into a card reader and then select **Register your client certificate**.

    Close the dialog box to finish.
