## URL Parameters

The form widget accepts the following parameters within the URL. Add these parameters to the page URL to display a specified record with the form widget.

</td></tr><tr><td>

**table**, **sl\_table**, or **t**

</td><td>

Table for the record to be displayed.The form widget validates access to the table by checking for the necessary cross-scope privileges when fetching data from the table. To turn off validating cross-scope privileges, you can set the **glide.service\_portal.enforce\_cross\_scope\_check\_in\_form** system property to false. For more information, see [Service Portal properties](properties-service-portal.md).

</table>In the following example, the URL would display an incident with a sys\_id of 1c741bd70b2322007518478d83673af3 in the portal view:

`https://example.service-now.com/sp?id=form&table=incident&sys_id=1c741bd70b2322007518478d83673af3&view=portal`

**Note:** Timer fields, such as Time Worked, don’t display correctly in Service Portal. For more information and a workaround, see the [Timer fields do not display the correct data in Service Portal \[KB0752404\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0752404) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

## Scripting

Not all client scripts are supported in the Service Portal. To understand how client scripts interact with forms in the Service Portal, see [Service Portal and client scripts](unsupported_client_scripts.md) and [Supported client script types and APIs](client-script-reference.md).
