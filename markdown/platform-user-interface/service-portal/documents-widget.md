# Documents widget

You can add, edit, or delete documents associated with records based on user permissions through the Documents widget. You can use this widget in your portal or clone and customize it.

**Note:** The Documents widget is available with the Multi Provider Document Services Framework plugin \(com.snc.multiprovider\_documents\). For more information, see [Multi Provider Document Services Framework](../../servicenow-platform/document-management-services/mp-document-services-framework-landing.md).

Add, edit, and delete documents related to a record with the Documents widget. You can drag and drop multiple files at a time, including editing and adding new versions. The default version shown is the latest version.

The maximum document size is 100 MB and concurrent uploads should be less than 10 MB.

**Note:** External users don’t have permission to share documents, review or approve documents, or access records in the platform.
