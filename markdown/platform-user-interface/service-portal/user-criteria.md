# User criteria for Service Portal

User criteria enables you to allow access to users based on role, department, group, location, or company. Administrators can control access to pages, widgets, widget instances, announcements, and search sources in a portal by creating and applying user criteria.

User criteria records define conditions that are evaluated against user records. When user criteria is defined, portal records are only visible to users who pass the defined conditions.

User criteria is a platform feature used in Service Portal. Learn more about user criteria in the ServiceNow AI Platform:
