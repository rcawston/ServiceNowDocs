# Current Status widget

The Current Status widget displays any issues reported in the system. You can use this base system widget as-is in your portal or clone it to suit your own business needs.

The Current Status widget checks the Outages \[cmdb\_ci\_outage\] table to see if the system is experiencing any outages.

Service owners and service desk managers report planned or unplanned outages by creating outage records. Each outage record includes **Begin** and **End** fields to indicate the duration of the outage. If the **End** time is later or empty, then the outage is still ongoing. The Current Status widget displays all ongoing outages.
