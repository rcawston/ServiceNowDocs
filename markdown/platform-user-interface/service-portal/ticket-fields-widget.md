# Ticket Fields widget

The Ticket Fields widget displays information about a request that a user has made. You can use this base system widget as-is in your portal or clone it to suit your own business needs.

## Using the widget

After a user submits a request, they can track their request on a ticket page in Service Portal. The user can consult the Ticket Fields widget to review the details of their request and check its resolution status.

Fields for the Ticket Fields widget are defined by the HTML template and the server.

If a user entered variables when submitting the request, they can view those variables in the Options section.

**Note:** The values that appear in the Options section are not field values from the ticket. They are Service Catalog variables that are associated with the ticket. For more information, see [Service catalog variables](../../servicenow-platform/service-catalog/c_ServiceCatalogVariables.md).

## Instance options

Use the instance options to configure the Ticket Fields widget for a portal page.
