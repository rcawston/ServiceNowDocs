# Create a condition statement using the condition builder

A condition builder constructs a condition statement with a series of contextually generated fields. Condition builders are used in many operations, such as creating filters, administering surveys, and administering access control.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

A condition consists of three parts: field, operator, and value.

|Part|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Field|A choice list based on the table and user access rights. The choice list can include fields on related tables by dot-walking.|
|Operator|A choice list based on the field type. For example, in the Incident \[incident\] table, the greater than operator does not apply to the **Active** field but it does apply to the **Priority** field.|
|Value|A text entry field or a choice list, depending on field type. For example, in the Incident \[incident\] table, the **Active** field offers a choice list with the values **true**, **false**, and **empty**, while the **Short Description** field offers a text entry field.|

## Procedure

1.  To add a dependent condition, select **AND** or **OR** next to the condition.

2.  To add a top-level condition, select **AND** or **OR** on the condition builder toolbar above the conditions.

3.  To remove a condition, select the delete icon \(X\) next to the condition.
