# Set the number of list collector items visible in the available column

You can modify the **glide.xmlhttp.excessive** property to change the number of items that appear in the **Available** column of the list collector.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Add the property to the System Properties \[sys\_properties\] table.

2.  Change the **Type** to **Integer**.

3.  Enter a number in the **Value** field.

    **Warning:** The default value is 100. Selecting a number significantly higher than 100 can lead to performance issues on your instance as the data is loaded into the list collector.

4.  Save the property.
