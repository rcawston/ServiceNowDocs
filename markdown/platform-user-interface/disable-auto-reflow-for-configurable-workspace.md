# Disable reflow for Configurable Workspace

Disable reflow for an instance, experience, or page.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

**Important:** Configurable Workspace pages must use the latest layout system for reflow to be available. For more information, see [Upgrading layouts in UI Builder](../application-development/ui-builder/upgrade-layout-uib.md)

Reflow helps users with low vision or who have trouble seeing web content in a browser due to monitor size, device type, poor lighting, or other situations by transforming page layouts into a vertical, stacked view automatically when users increase browser zoom to 400%. Additionally, content can be enlarged without scrolling in two dimensions at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels or a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels.

A width of 320 CSS pixels is equivalent to a starting viewport width of 1280 CSS pixels at 400% zoom. For web content designed to scroll horizontally, a height of 256 CSS pixels is equivalent to a starting viewport height of 1024 CSS pixels at 400% zoom.

Although reflow is available by default, you can disable it for instances, experiences, and pages.
