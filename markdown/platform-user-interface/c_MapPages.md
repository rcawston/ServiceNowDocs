# Map pages

Map pages display ServiceNow data graphically on a Google map page based on location data that you provide.

You can create as many map pages as required to define the types of data to display, the links to show, and the appearance of the map. After creating the map pages, you can create modules to display the map pages.

**Note:** Map pages are subject to the non-production access limitations. See [Set up Google Maps API](set-up-google-maps-api.md) for details.

## Map locations

Locations are used by various applications to locate users, facilities, or configuration items \(CI\) and are stored in the Location \[cmn\_location\] table. You can configure different levels of location in a parent-child hierarchy. For example, an email server might be associated with a location of Second Floor, whereas the email business service might be associated with New York City.

Each level of this hierarchy contains a separate location record, with the next higher level specified as a parent.

The location is also used to generate a full identifier in the **Full name** field, which is available by configuring the form. For more information, see [Show or hide fields on a form](../platform-administration/configure-form-layout.md).

## How locations are defined

To create a location, navigate to **User Administration** &gt; **Locations** and select **New**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Parent

</td><td>

Name of the parent location for this location. Location hierarchies are described earlier.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Latitude

</td><td>

The latitude of the location.The **get\_lat\_long** business rule automatically populates this field and the **Longitude** field described below when the form contains enough information, such as an address or city name and a postal code.

 Deactivate this business rule to avoid the system overwriting any values entered manually into these fields.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Longitude

</td><td>

The longitude of the location.

</td></tr><tr><td class="sub-head" colspan="2">

A read-only, calculated field that assembles the parent hierarchy of the location into a full name.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Stock room

</td><td>

A Boolean field that identifies whether the location is being used as a stock room.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Time zone

The time zone of the location. By default, the location uses the system time zone.

</table>## Latitude and longitude

When a **Company** or **Location** record is created, or has one of its address fields changed `[street, city, state, zip or country]`, the **get\_lat\_long** business rule is triggered. This business rule uses the **GoogleMapsHelper** script include to create `sys_geocoding_request` records.

The scheduled job **Process Geocoding Request** must be enabled to process `sys_geocoding_request` records. **Process Geocoding Request** uses the Google Map service to populate the latitude and longitude fields of the changed or created **Company** and **Location** records.

After the latitude and longitude are populated, Map Pages can be defined that display locations in an interactive map.

**Note:** Latitude and longitude are expressed as a floating point data type. Previous releases expressed this information as a string. During an upgrade, the system converts the data where possible.

-   **[Set up Google Maps API](set-up-google-maps-api.md)**

-   **[Create a map page](t_CreateAMapPage.md)**  
Your ServiceNow instance provides several default map pages. You can also create custom map pages with the script examples described in this page.
-   **[Create a map page module](create-map-page-module.md)**  
You can create a new application module for desktop or smartphone users to display a Google map page.
-   **[Create an advanced Map Page](create-advanced-map-page.md)**  
Use advanced configuration to set up Map Pages without scripting.
-   **[Set map application scope](set-map-application-scope.md)**  
Enable map application scope to specify which application can modify your Map Page configuration.
-   **[Create a smartphone map page module](t_CreateASmartphoneMapPageModule.md)**  
You can create a custom smartphone module that links directly to a map page.
-   **[Scripting for map pages](scripting-for-map-pages.md)**  
The Script field on the Map Page form allows the use of attributes or custom code to define map characteristics, such as marker appearance, display information, and more.
