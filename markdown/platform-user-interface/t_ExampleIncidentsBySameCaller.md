# Add incidents by same caller related list

This example adds the existing relationship, Incidents by Same Caller, to incident forms.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

-   **Applies to table**: This list appears as an available related list when viewing an incident record.
-   **Queries from table**: This list displays a list of incidents.
-   **Query with**: This script selects records where the **caller\_id** matches the **caller\_id** of the parent record \(the incident you are viewing\).

## What to do next

Notes and limitations:

-   Creating a record using a related list applies the list filter to the record and auto-populates the related field. This behavior applies to reference, string, Boolean, and menu fields when the criteria in the filter is set to **is** or **=**.
-   For example, if you click the **New** button on one of these new relationships, the system attempts to ensure that the new record matches the list conditions. For example, clicking **New** on the example list results in an incident where the **caller\_id** is pre-populated with **Bud Richman**.
-   When scripting your condition, **current** is the record to which you want to add queries while **parent** is the main record being displayed.
-   These relationships do not refresh until you update a form. In the example, if you changed the caller from **Bud Richman** to **Fred Luddy**, the list at the bottom of the screen still displays the incidents belonging to Bud Richman until you save the incident.
-   You are not limited to a single query condition. It is, for example, possible to have a related list of all incidents opened by the same caller in the last week, or all **open** incidents opened by the same caller.
-   The **current** and **parent** objects cannot be used with the **Queries from** field. Instead, the **gs** object is available for GlideSystem calls.
-   The **Edit** button is not available on defined relationships, as the relationship is scripted.

Additional use case: You can enable a similar relationship for the Request table to display **Requests by the Same Caller** using **Requested For** on the Request table.
