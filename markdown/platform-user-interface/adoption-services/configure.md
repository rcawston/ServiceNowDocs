# Configure

Configure Dynamic Guidance to be available in the Help Center and Now Assist panel.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_dyn\_guidance\_admin and sn\_nowassist\_admin.nsa\_admin

**Note:** By default, Dynamic Guidance as a skill is active for applicable users but not accessible. The admin \(with role sn\_dyn\_guidance\_admin\) must assign sn\_dyn\_guidance\_user role to users who can access Dynamic Guidance.

Follow these steps to enable Dynamic Guidance on Help Center and Now Assist panel:

## Procedure

1.  Log in to the relevant instance.

2.  Navigate to **Now Assist Admin**.

3.  Select **Platform** &gt; **Knowledge** under **Now Assist Skills**.

4.  Search for **Dynamic guidance** and select **Activate skills**.

    -   Dynamic Guidance gets enabled on Help Center.
    -   External Content Connectors\(XCC\) ServiceNow Docs plugin is automatically installed as a dependency. This ensures that the XCC infrastructure for documentation search is available.

## What to do next

-   Configure external content connectors to integrate with Dynamic Guidance. See [External content connector in Dynamic Guidance](external-content-connector-in-dynamic-guidance.md).
-   Link Dynamic Guidance to additional documentation sources. See [Adding custom sources](adding-custom-sources.md).
