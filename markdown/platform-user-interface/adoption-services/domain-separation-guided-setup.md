# Domain separation and Guided Setup

Domain separation is supported for Guided Setup. Domain separation enables you to separate data, processes, and administrative tasks into logical groupings called domains. You can control several aspects of this separation, including which users can see and access data.

## Support level: Basic



-   Business logic: Ensure that data goes into the proper domain for the application’s service provider use cases.
-   The application supports domain separation at run time. The domain separation includes separation from the user interface, cache keys, reporting, rollups, and aggregations.
-   The owner of the instance must set up the application to function across multiple tenants.

Sample use case: When a service provider \(SP\) uses chat to respond to a tenant-customer’s message, the customer must be able to see the SP's response.

For more information on support levels, see [Application support for domain separation](../../platform-security/domain-separated-apps.md).

## Key points

There are some key points to note with domain separation support.

-   Guided Setup player can view new guided setup execution for every domain.
-   Creation and updation of Guided Setup is allowed in global domain scope only. This requires builder roles.

    Migration of existing setups is initiated only in global scope.

    Status of setups in progress is shown as applicable to the domain scopes.
