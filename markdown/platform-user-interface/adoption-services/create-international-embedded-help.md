# Create internationalized embedded help

Translate provided English embedded help content into other languages or create custom embedded help content in the language of your choice.

## Before you begin

Role required: embedded\_help\_admin or admin

## About this task

All embedded help content records are in English by default. To create a non-English embedded help content record, there must first be an English content record in the Embedded Help \[sys\_embedded\_help\_content\] table. The English embedded help content record is parent to all other language embedded help content records. Once you create a non-English embedded help content record, it resides in the Translated Texts \[sys\_translated\_text\] table.

To translate provided English content into another language, create a copy of the English content record and save the edited, non-English, copy record. The new record is saved to the Translated Texts \[sys\_translated\_text\] table. Refer to [Add custom embedded help from a copy](add-custom-help-copy.md) to translate available embedded help content.

To create a non-English custom embedded help content record, your working instance must be configured to the same language you intend to write in. You create custom non-English embedded help content when English embedded help content is not available to copy.

After creating a non-English embedded help content record, you must create the same content record in English and store it in the Embedded Help \[sys\_embedded\_help\_content\] table. The English embedded help content record is parent to all other languages.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Embedded Help** &gt; **Help Content**.

2.  Open the embedded help topic to copy.

    You can also open an embedded help topic by selecting **Edit Help Article** from the menu in the embedded help pane.

3.  Update the fields as appropriate.
