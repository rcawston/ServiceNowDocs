# Enable Guided Tours

Enable guided tours for Standard platform UI, Workspace, Service Portal pages, and Custom UI.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  In the application navigator, enter `sys_properties.list` and press the Enter key.

2.  From the System Properties list, find the following properties and make sure that their values are set to **True**.

    |Property|Description|
    |--------|-----------|
    |com.snc.guided\_tours.standard\_ui.enable|Enables guided tours across your instance to run on the Standard platform UI and Workspace.|
    |com.snc.guided\_tours.sp.enable|Enables guided tours across your instance to run on Service Portal pages.|
    |com.snc.guided\_tours.custom\_ui.enable|Enables guided tours across your instance to run on the Custom UI pages.|

3.  If the values of the system properties aren’t set to true, change them to **True**.


## Result

You can create, update, and play guided tours within the ServiceNow® user interface.

**Note:**

-   The Guided Tour Designer is only available in Core UI. The designer isn’t compatible with UI15. For information about how to activate the Core UI plugin, see [Activate Core UI](../t_ActivateUI16.md).

-   Guided Tours are supported in Next Experience pages, such as Workspace or pages configured in UI Builder using the Next Experience UI Framework.

    Set the value of the system property `com.snc.guided_tours.standard_ui.enable` to **True** to enable Guided Tours under Next Experience. The following scenarios are still supported with Next Experience enabled:

    -   Creating and running new or existing Guided Tours in the Classic Environment \(including lists and forms\).
    -   Creating and running new or existing Guided Tours for a Service Portal.
    -   Creating new Guided Tours for Unified Navigation menus \(such as the **All** or **Favorites** menus\).
