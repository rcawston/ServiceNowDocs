# Filters and breadcrumbs

A filter is a set of conditions applied to a table to help you find and work with a subset of the data in that table.

You can apply, modify, create, and save filters. A hierarchical list of conditions at the top of the table — breadcrumbs — indicates the current filter.

Breadcrumbs offer a quick form of filter navigation. They are ordered from left to right. The left condition is the most general, and the right condition is the most specific. Clicking a breadcrumb removes all the conditions to its right. Clicking the condition separator \(&gt;\) before a condition removes only that condition.

By default, a user with no roles cannot see the breadcrumbs or filter. Administrators can configure the ESS portal to allow unauthenticated users to see breadcrumbs and filters by using a script include. For more information on using script includes to suppress breadcrumbs and filters, see [Use script includes to suppress filters and breadcrumbs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/list-administration/t_SuppressFiltersScriptInclude.md) .

Examples:

-   Clicking **Priority = 2** removes the condition **Category = Software** and returns all active incidents with a priority of 2.
-   Clicking the condition separator \(&gt;\) before **Priority = 2** removes the condition **Priority = 2** and returns all active incidents in the software category.
-   Clicking **All** removes all conditions and returns all incidents in the system.

Click a breadcrumb to refresh the list of records and show the latest information for those records.

**Note:** Clicking the **New** button in a filtered list automatically applies the same filter to the new record. For example, clicking **New** in the Resolved Incidents list opens a record preset with **State** set to **Resolved**. In a list filtered for active, priority 1 incidents, clicking **New** opens a record preset with **Active** selected and **Priority** set to **1 - Critical**.

You can change the preset values on the form as needed. If there is a field you do not want to have populated in this way, you can add the following dictionary attribute to the field: **ignore\_filter\_on\_new=true**.

Additional navigational functions are available when you right-click a breadcrumb.

<table id="table_wr2_3mw_tt"><thead><tr><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Open new window

</td><td>

Opens the results list for the breadcrumb in a new tab or window.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Copy URL

</td><td>

Copies the URL to the clipboard for the results list of the breadcrumb. Follow browser instructions if browser security measures restrict this function.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Copy query

</td><td>

Copies the encoded query to the clipboard for the breadcrumb. You can use this query in the URL of an instance or in the reference qualifier field of a dictionary entry.For example, if you are viewing a list of all active incidents with a high or medium impact, right-click the breadcrumb and copy the query **active=true^impact=1^ORimpact=2**. You can append this query to the end of the instance URL as follows:

 `https://{instance_name}/incident_list.do?sysparm_query=active=true^impact=1^ORimpact=2`

 This selection is not available for the **All** breadcrumb.
