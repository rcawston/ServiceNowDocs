# Create defined related lists

You can add default related lists to the form for all users to see when viewing records.

## Before you begin

Role required: related\_list\_admin

## About this task

For example, you may include a list of related incidents at the bottom of a problem record, or a list of members at the bottom of a group record. This functionality depends on reference fields or many-to-many table relationships. If two tables are related via the system dictionary, one can appear as a related list on the other.

Defined related lists allow relationships between arbitrary tables to be expressed as a related list. Any two tables that can have a logical relationship can appear as a parent/child pair via a related list. The following are some examples.

-   On an incident record, show all incidents opened by the same caller.
-   On a user record, show the last 20 transactions that user has made.
-   On an incident record, show all problems opened on the reported CI.

These relationships are beyond the relationships normally defined in the system dictionary through reference fields and many-to-many relationships.

Every related list requires a relationship record. Before creating a relationship, verify that there is not an existing relationship record that already provides the needed information. Use the following steps to create a relationship record.

## Procedure

1.  Click **System Definition** &gt; **Relationships**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  Specify the relationship record fields.

<table id="table_rqf_w5c_xp"><thead><tr><th>

This field is hidden in Advanced relationship records.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Specify the records to include by typing a script.For example:

```
current.addQuery('opened_by', parent.sys_id);
```

-   The `current` object specifies the current record on which the script is triggered.
-   The `addQuery` method adds a filter that returns records meeting a specified condition.
-   The `opened_by` variable is the field name you're querying in the table from **Queries from table**.
-   The `parent.sys_id` variable refers to the **Applies to table** and the ID of the record being displayed.
