5.  If you chose to upload a brand image , generate your theme colors using AI.

    4.  Modify the palette by selecting either the Primary or Secondary tile and select the **add \(+\)** button or choose from the AI-generated supporting colors.

        **Note:** The AI detects up to eight colors from your image, with the two most dominant pre-selected as the primary and secondary. Any additional detected colors are suggested as available options that you can swap in as needed.
