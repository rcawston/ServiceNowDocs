# Search a list

You can search a list to find information quickly. The list title bar includes options for searching the list. Administrators can enable text searches for any list.

## Before you begin

Role required: none

## About this task

There are two options for searching the list: for a string in a selected field, or for a text string found in any field. These options are labeled **Go to** and **Search**.

-   The **Go to** option sorts the list by the selected field and returns records where the field value is equal to or greater than the search term. For the **Number** field, which is a string type field, it finds the records that have a number ending with the number that you enter. For example, searching a list of incidents by selecting **Number** and entering `4` shows records with numbers like **INC0000004** and **INC0000014**.
-   The **Search** option appears when you select **for text**. It returns records that contain the search term in any field in the list table. If you added a related list condition, the search does not include records in the related table.

Each option in a choice list is defined with a column label and a value. For example, the incident **State** field contains several options, such as **New** and **Closed**. These labels are column labels, and each one has an underlying value. For incidents, the default value for **New** is **1** and the default value for **Closed** is **7**. You can search a column for either the column label or the value with the following results.

-   Enter the column label to list matching records, for example, all incident records in the **New** state.
-   Enter the value to find records that have a state greater than or equal to \(=&gt;\) the specified value. For example, enter **6** to list incident records in the **Resolved** and **Closed** states.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to a list of records.

2.  If necessary, personalize the list to add the desired fields.

3.  Select a field or select **for text**.

4.  Enter the search text.

    Use wildcards to further refine list searches.

5.  Press the Enter key to execute the search.

## Available list search wildcards

The platform supports several wildcard characters to expand and refine search results.

<table id="table_jht_2xz_bz"><thead><tr><th>

Wildcard

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

\*search-term

 %search-term%

</td><td>

Search for values that contain search-term.

</td></tr><tr><td>

%search-term

</td><td>

Search for values that end with search-term.

</td></tr><tr><td>

search-term%

</td><td>

Search for values that start with search-term.

</td></tr><tr><td>

=search-term

</td><td>

Search for values that equal search-term.

</td></tr><tr><td>

!\*search-term

</td><td>

Search for values that don't contain search-term.

</td></tr><tr><td>

!%search-term

</td><td>

Search for values that start end with search-term.

</td></tr><tr><td>

!=search-term

</td><td>

Search for values that don't equal search-term.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>**Note:** Reference fields support a different set of wildcard operators. For details on using wildcards to search reference field auto-complete values, see [Auto-complete for reference fields](../platform-administration/c_AutoCompleteForReferenceFields.md).

## Configure the default search behavior

The default search behavior in a list is to search for values that are greater than or equal to the value you enter. Administrators can add properties to change the search behavior to use either a contains search or a starts with search by default, instead of a greater than search.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

### About this task

If you enter text in the search box without using a wildcard, the search is performed for values greater than or equal to the value you enter. For text data-type-fields, this means that the search first sorts the records on the selected field, then finds the first record that starts with the text and all following records. For numeric data-type-fields, this means that the search finds all records where the number field ends with the entered number.

**Note:** The system treats some string fields that contain record numbers as numeric fields. Any field named number or u\_number is treated as a numeric field.

Changing the default search behavior to contains or starts with can cause performance issues as both search options return more results than a greater than search.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to the list of system properties by typing `sys_properties.list` into the navigation filter.

2.  Add one of the following properties depending on your default search behavior preferences.

<table id="table_s4q_pmb_qcb"><thead><tr><th>

Name

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

**glide.ui.goto\_use\_contains**

</td><td>

Changes the default search behavior for a list to a contains search.-   Type: true \| false
-   Value: true


</td></tr><tr><td>

**glide.ui.goto\_use\_starts\_with**

</td><td>

Changes the default search behavior for a list to a starts with search.-   Type: true \| false
-   Value: true


</td></tr></tbody>
</table>3.  Click **Submit**.

### Configure default search behavior using a dictionary attribute

Change the default search behavior at the field level by adding an attribute to a field using the system dictionary.

#### Before you begin

Role required: admin

#### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Definition** &gt; **Dictionary**.

2.  Search for the field in a table that you want to apply the default search attribute to.

3.  In the Attributes field, add one of the following attributes.

    **Note:** You may need to switch to the advanced view for the dictionary entry to see the attributes field.

    |Attribute|Description|
    |---------|-----------|
    |**goto\_use\_starts\_with=true**|Changes the default search behavior to use the starts with operator for a specific field. Applying starts with to a non-text field returns any data starting with that search, which can cause performance degradation.|
