Script Debugger

</td><td>

Opens a JavaScript debugger with a script tracer and a session log. For more information, see [Debugging scripts](../api-reference/scripts/script-debug-overview.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

UX Source Maps

</td><td>

Enables you to perform debugging using UX source maps in your browser. For example, when used with Firefox v102+, the user can set a break point in component code and, when the browser stops at that break point, variable names should appear in the scope section. **Note:** When you are not debugging using UX source maps, it is best to toggle this user preference off as it can cause performance degradation of the instance.

Automated Test Framework Page Inspector

</td><td>

Enables you to identify and inspect pages created in classic custom UI pages using the page inspector. For more information, see [Page Inspector](../application-development/automated-test-framework-atf/atf-page-inspector.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Seismic Developer Tool

</td><td>

Opens a link to the Chrome web store Seismic Developer Tools download page. The Seismic Dev Tools \(SDT\) Chrome Extension is a tool that helps Seismic developers effectively identify, diagnose, and resolve defects and performance issues.**Note:** This option can be removed from the Debugging user preferences by setting the **glide.ui.next\_experience.seismic\_developer\_tool\_user\_pref\_enabled** system property to **false**.
