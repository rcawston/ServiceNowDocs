# Configuring search in Next Experience

Administrators can customize Next Experience search settings. Add new searchable tables, modify the fields displayed for search results from a table, or add workspace applications to the search context menu for users.

Next Experience search is enabled by default in the Unified Navigation.

## Add a searchable table

A search source specifies a table to include in Next Experience search. The search results page displays matching records and their counts on a per-table basis. Users can select a table to filter their search results, displaying only matching records from the selected table.

To make a table searchable in Next Experience, add it as a new search source. For details on this procedure, see [Add a search source for Next Experience](../platform-administration/search-administration/search-settings-filter-group-table.md).

For the list of tables searchable by default in the base system, see [Default global search sources for Next Experience](../platform-administration/search-administration/search-settings-filter-group-table.md).

## Modify the fields displayed for each search result from a table

The text\_search list view for a searchable table determines which fields the system uses to populate the title, field list, and description for each result from that table.

To learn how the system uses fields in the text\_search list view to populate search result entries, see [Text search views control format of global search results for tables](../platform-administration/search-administration/text-search-view-formats-results.md).

For the list of fields included in the base system's text\_search list views for the default searchable tables, see [Default display fields for global search tables](../platform-administration/search-administration/global-search-default-tables.md).

## Add a workspace application to the search context menu

The search context menu enables users to view and open search results in available workspace applications as well as in global search.

To add a workspace application to the search context menu, see [Add a workspace application to the Unified Navigation search context menu](../platform-administration/search-administration/add-app-search-context-polaris-ui.md).

For details on using the search context menu, see [View and open search results using workspace applications in Next Experience Unified Navigation](../platform-administration/search-administration/global-search-polaris-ui.md).

For more information on configuring search settings in Next Experience, see [Global search finds records from multiple tables](../platform-administration/search-administration/c_GlobalTextSearch.md).
