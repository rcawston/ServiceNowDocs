# Adjust a component to meet accessibility standards

Adjust a component to meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines \(WCAG\) 2.1. When you're editing a component in Theme Builder and see a warning symbol, that indicates that the component doesn't conform with the guidelines for color contrast.

## Before you begin

Role required: ui\_builder\_admin

For information on granular roles, see [Granular admin roles](../platform-security/granular-admin-roles.md).

## About this task

When you're editing a component in Theme Builder, you may encounter a warning symbol \(![Accessibility error](../image/tb-accessibility-icon.png)\), which indicates that the component doesn't comply with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines \(WCAG\) 2.1 for color contrast. The WCAG 2.1 contrast ratio that Theme Builder targets for content and UI variables is 3:1. This ratio determines the contrasts between brighter and darker screen colors and how they relate to the user interface. The first digit shows the level of bright colors, and the second digit shows the relative level of dark colors. The 3:1 threshold provides optimal visibility to visually challenged users. For more information, see the [W3C Recommendation site for WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).

The total number of accessibility violations are indicated on the red numbered badge \(![Accessibility inspector numbered badge.](../image/tb-a11y-inspector-badge.png)\) alongside the Accessibility inspector panel.

## Procedure

1.  From the Editor page, access the accessibility violations in one of the two ways listed in the following table.

3.  Select from the link in the warning to fix the contrast issue.

    The color picker opens.

    **Note:** You can select the Hide inaccessible choices slider within the color picker to limit the color choices to those colors identified as accessible, based on Web Content Accessibility Guidelines \(WCAG\) guidelines.

4.  Select the undo symbol to revert your changes back to the original color, if needed.

5.  When you complete your changes and the accessibility warning symbol is no longer visible, select **Save changes**.

    For example, after you select a color that passes the contrast ratio violation, the warning symbol turns green in the color picker.
