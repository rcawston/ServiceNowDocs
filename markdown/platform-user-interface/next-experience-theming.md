# Working with themes in Next Experience

Themes enable you to tailor the visual experience for your users, helping to update the look and feel to be more like your brand.

Quickly create, edit, preview, and publish themes to your experiences using Theme Builder. See [Configure Next Experience with Theme Builder](configuring-next-experience-with-theme-builder.md) for more information.

**Important:** Theming applies to the classic environment in Lists, Forms, and Dashboards. Custom components don't reflect theming.

## Theming at a glance

-   Theming is the ability to customize the Next Experience Design System to reflect your product or brand.
-   Theming means styling various aspects of the ServiceNow® platform while maintaining the overall look and feel.
-   Theming typically involves changing the colors to your company brand colors but can also include typography, imagery, shape and form.

## Next Experience default themes

New customers launching on Zurich will have the Next Experience Coral theme enabled by default on their instance.

Existing customers upgrading from a previous release will continue to see the theme they've applied to their instance prior to upgrade, for example the Next Experience Polaris theme or a theme created in Theme Builder. Use [Theme Builder to publish Coral theme to your instance](tb-apply-theme.md) or [add Coral theme to the Next Experience UX Parent App Theme table.](configure-presentation-order-of-themes.md)

## Theme record

This image shows the default Polaris theme, which is read-only. You create your own themes and styles to be used by experiences in your instance by either cloning the Polaris or Coral theme or [by cloning a Theme Builder theme record](create-custom-theme-using-theme-builder-record.md). If you clone either the Polaris or Coral theme, you also must clone the styles under UX Theme Styles and make changes to those styles, as desired. At least one Core type style must be defined.

## Theme styles

You can configure a theme to match your company brand look and feel in ServiceNow. When you configure a theme, you adjust the color schemes, fonts, and images of your applications. On the Theme Builder Theme form, you configure Order, Style, and Type settings.

-   **Order**

    Style records with higher-order values override styles with lower values. The base system styles all have the order 0. If you meet the Applicability constraint, styles with higher values override the base system styles. If not, the lower-value style is used.

-   **Style**

    Style records define reusable styles that together comprise a theme. Core styles include color, shape and form, typography, and imagery. Variants are a different version of the theme, commonly different colors, that users can select in preferences. The most common use of variants is for accessibility purposes, particularly to account for color blindness. If you decide to use a dark theme, consider selecting the Polaris or Coral theme or [create a dark alternate color palette in Theme Builder](tb-edit-color-palette.md).

-   **Type**

    Styles can be of either the Core type or the Variant type. Core styles are active by default. Users can choose from available variants from their Theme user preference, and those variant styles override the core style. Theme Builder doesn’t automatically generate dark theme variants; however, you can create a dark alternate color palette with limited customization. For more information, see [Add an alternate color palette](tb-edit-color-palette.md). The Polaris and Coral themes include a Dark Theme variant that is available on instances with Next Experience enabled.
