# Change survey question header colors

The Classic Environment uses a header color from the base color, which allows theming from CSS properties.

## About this task

One notable exception is the survey, which has its own CSS. It is possible to change the CSS by adding a property.

## Procedure

1.  Enter `sys_properties.form` into the navigation filter and press the Enter key.

    A new Property form displays.

2.  Name the new property `css.list.row.survey.background.color`.

3.  Enter the hexadecimal value of the desired color into the **Value** field.

4.  Click **Submit**.

    The survey should now use the desired color.
