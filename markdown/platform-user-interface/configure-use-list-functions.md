# Configure and use list functions

All users can interact with lists for the tables their role permits them to access. Some list and column header menu options are controlled by permissions grated to the user role.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

The following procedures describe functions that users can configure or use with lists.

**Parent Topic:**[Lists in the classic environment](c_UseLists.md)

## Sort a list

You can quickly find information in a list by sorting the list. The method that the system uses to sort a list depends on the type of record in the sort column.

### Before you begin

Role required: none

### About this task

Consider the example record: Label=**Requested Item**; Value=**sc\_req\_item**. Field types other than choice list types are sorted based on the label. The example record label, **Requested Item**, would be sorted with records whose labels start with "r."

A choice list field lets the user select from a pre-defined set of choices. Choice list fields are sorted by the underlying dictionary entry value of the field, not by the label. The example record value, **sc\_req\_item** would be sorted with records whose values start with "s."

Sorting by value can be useful. For example, choices for the **State** of tasks are ordered **New** &gt; **Work in Progress** &gt; **Closed**. Based on the label, the sort would be **Closed** &gt; **New** &gt; **Work in Progress**.

An arrow next to the column name indicates the current sort order. A downward pointing arrow indicates that the column is sorted in descending order. Only the primary sort order is indicated.

**Note:** The following sorting rules apply to lists:

-   In a translated instance, only translated\_text, translated\_field, and translated\_html type columns support sorting.
-   The column label should be created in English first then translated accordingly.
-   You cannot sort a list by an array-based field, such as a Glide list.

To sort a list, use one of the following methods:

### Procedure

-   Click a column name to sort the list in ascending order.

    Click again to sort in reverse order.

-   Right-click a column name and select **Sort \(a to z\)** or **Sort \(z to a\)** to sort in ascending or descending order, respectively.

-   Specify a sort order with a filter.

    Filters provide for sorting by more than one column \(for example, by Category and then Subcategory\).

## Configure field status indicators

You can enable or disable modern cell coloring for list field status indicators. This setting is available when you personalize a list. This setting is available in your system settings.

### Before you begin

Role required: none

### About this task

Field status indicators on lists are displayed with modern cell coloring, as a colored circle on the left side of the field. You can select the style of the field status indicator. You can revert to using a field background color by disabling modern cell coloring.

## Customize the number of list rows per page

You can customize the number of records, or rows, to display on each page of a list. The default is 20 rows per page.

2.  Right-click the list title and select **Show** &gt; **&lt;Number&gt; rows per page**.

    The list refreshes to display the number of records selected, or, if there are fewer than the number of rows you are displaying, the total number of records. The page control is updated to show your selected number of records \(![Page control](../image/PageControl.png)\).


## Switch between list views

A view defines the elements that appear when a user opens a list.

### Before you begin

Role required: none

## Speed up loading large lists

Remove the calculation of the total number of records in a list to speed up loading lists.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

### About this task

Calculating the total number of records to be included in a list filtered from extremely large tables can take a long time.

To improve performance, you can remove that calculation for all or specified views.

### Procedure

1.  On a list, click the menu icon \(![Menu icon](../../../administer/navigation-and-ui/image/MenuIconUI14.png)\) and navigate to **Configure** &gt; **List Control**.

2.  On the List Control page, select a check box:

    -   **Remove pagination count**—Removes pagination calculation from all views.
    -   **Remove pagination count for specified views**—Removes pagination calculation from specified views.
3.  If you selected **Remove pagination count for specified views**, click the lock icon \(![Lock icon](../../../common/image/icon-lock.png)\) and select the views that suppress displaying the number of pages in the list.

4.  Verify that the pagination is not calculated for your view by switching to that view.

    On a list, click the menu icon \(![Menu icon](../../../administer/navigation-and-ui/image/MenuIconUI14.png)\) and navigate to **View** &gt; **&lt;a view&gt;**.

    The pagination calculation should not appear and the fast forward icon \(![Fast forward icon](../../../administer/workspace/image/icon-fast-forward.png)\) should be grayed out.


## Perform actions on selected items in a list

Action check boxes enable you to perform actions on one or more items in a list.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

### About this task

![Action check boxes and action choice list.](../image/ActionList.png)

### Procedure

1.  Select the check boxes beside the records you want to affect.

    To select all records on the page, select the check box at the top of the list.

2.  Apply the desired action.

    -   In the column context menu, select **Update Selected** to update all the selected records.
    -   In the Action on selected rows menu, select an action such as **Delete** \(administrators only\), or **Add to Visual Task Board**. The available actions vary depending on the list and which plugins are activated.

## Embedded lists

Some lists may be embedded in forms. Use list controls to work with records in an embedded list within a form.

Use these controls to work with an embedded list. For more information, see [Edit a form](t_EditingInForms.md#).
