# Personal lists

You can create personal lists to customize which columns appear and the order in which they appear. Personal lists modify a specific list view according to your individual preferences.

Personal list customizations don’t affect what other users see in their lists. Administrators can [manage](../platform-administration/list-administration/c_AdministeringPersonalLists.md) the personal lists function.

**Parent Topic:**[Lists in the classic environment](c_UseLists.md)

## Personalize a list

You can personalize a specific list view based on your individual preferences.

### Before you begin

Role required: personalize\_list or admin

### Procedure

1.  Open the list.

2.  Select the personalize list icon \(![Personalize list icon](../image/PersonalizeListIcon.png)\) in the right corner.

3.  Select the columns and the desired order.

    ![Personalize list columns](../image/PersonalizeListColumns.png)

    **Note:**

    -   Values in the first column appear as links. If the first column isn’t a reference field, the link opens the record from the list, as expected. If the first column is a reference field, the link opens the record from the referenced table. This behavior can be confusing. For this reason, avoid using a reference field as the first column.
    -   If an inactive field is removed from an admin-configured default view, any personal lists will reset to follow the default view, thus removing the inactive field from the personal list.
4.  Select display options.

    **Note:** These options apply to all lists, not just the view you’re personalizing.

<table id="choicetable_qgk_vbz_3r"><tbody><tr><td id="d44033e171">

</td><td>

Select the **Wrap column text** check box. Clear the check box to display text on one line.In Core UI, this option is also available in the **Lists** section of the [system settings](r_UI16BannerFrame.md).

    **Note:** These options apply to all lists, not just the view you’re personalizing.

**Allow the list editor to open for the list**

</td><td>
