# Customize the list block

List blocks are content blocks that dynamically generate a list of links to records within the instance. When a user clicks a link in a list block, the associated information is displayed in a detail page determined by its content type.

## Before you begin

Role required: content\_admin or admin

## About this task

Make the list using a simple query on any table or by scripting a more advanced query. Lists are powerful and flexible. Here are some places that allow you to have complete control over the list display.

|Option|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Frames|Frames provide a method to create decorative containers for content blocks and other elements within the site. When frames are used with the **Type** field, the designer has complete control over list placement.|
|List Type|The List Definitions module defines the type of lists available for content pages. On the List Block form, select a list definition in the **Type** field.|
|List Filtering|Provides every field in the referenced table for more granular results.|
|Max Entries|Limits the results from a table to fit the design of the block.|
|Order and Order Direction|Allows sorting by any field in the referenced table, in either ascending or descending order.|

You can also use list blocks to create a list of links to information outside your instance. Create the external links as records on the Content Link \[content\_link\] table, and then follow the steps in this procedure.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Content Management** &gt; **Lists**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  Complete form.
