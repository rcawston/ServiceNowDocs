2.  Open the site to add the page.

3.  In the **Pages** related list, click **New**.

4.  Complete the form.

Name

</td><td>

A unique name for the page. Prefix each page name with the name of the site followed by a dash and the page function. For example, **ESS - Catalog Detail** and **ESS - Search Results** are page names within the **ESS** site.

</td></tr><tr><td>

URL suffix

</td><td>

The URL suffix that identifies the page. It is incorporated into the URL as follows: `http://instance name.service-now.com/site/url_suffix.do`

</td></tr><tr><td>

Parent page

</td><td>

</td></tr><tr><td>

Layout

</td><td>

The layout to use for the page. Layouts define dropzones where content blocks can be added to the page. If this field is left blank, the page inherits the default layout of the site. If the site does not have a default layout, there is a single dropzone for the entire page.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Content theme

</td><td>

The theme to use for the page. Themes bundle CSS style sheets that are applied to all content within the page.If this field is left blank, the page inherits the default theme of the site. Use the default theme unless the page requires a different set of CSS style sheets from the other pages in the site.

</td><td>

Select the check box to remove any restrictions placed by frames that contain the page. This way you avoid frame-within-frame issues that sometimes occur with improper linking.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Content site

</td><td>

The site associated with the content page. If you created the page from the related list in the site, the value defaults. The content site provides the &lt;site\_suffix&gt; in the page URL, as follows:`http://<instance name>.service-now.com/site_suffix/page_suffix.do`
