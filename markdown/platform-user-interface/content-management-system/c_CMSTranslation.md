# CMS translation

You can translate CMS sites by activating internationalization plugins and manually translating custom interface strings.

Two tables support the translation of a CMS site into other languages.

-   Translated Name / Field \[sys\_translated\]: Stores strings that are shared or commonly used within a site. These include menu section names, menu item names, site breadcrumb names, link names, and footer menu links. Internationalization plugins typically provide translations for these strings. See[System Localization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/system-localization/system-localization-landing.md).
-   Translated Text \[sys\_translated\_text\]: Stores unique string translations which you create when you manually translate interface elements. See [Export and edit translation records](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/system-localization/t_TranslateTheInterface.md).
