# Integrate Live Feed with CMS

You can provide access to Live Feed from pages built in the Content Management System \(CMS\). For example, allow an end user to access your company feed via the ESS portal.

## Before you begin

## About this task

The ESS Portal template includes the **Portal - Live page** and **Live Feed** dynamic block \(requires the Live Feed plugin\). To provide access to Live Feed from CMS pages, [add the Live Feed dynamic block](t_AddContentToAPage.md) to a CMS page or include the **Portal - Live page** in a site.

## Procedure

2.  Click **New**.

3.  Complete the iFrame block form with the following values.

    |Field|Input value|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Name|Type a unique name: `Live Frame`|
    |Frame name|Type a frame name: `live_frame`|
    |URL|Enter `https://instance name/live_feed.do?sysparm_doctype=true`. Replace instance name with your instance URL, for example, `<myinstance>.service-now.com`.|
    |Sizing|Select **Fixed Size** and enter height and width pixel dimensions according to the page on which you plan to display the feed. For example, enter a width of 1024 and height of 768.|
