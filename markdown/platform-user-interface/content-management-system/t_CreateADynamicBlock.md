# Configure dynamic blocks

Use dynamic blocks to use scripting or to pull information from the system. Dynamic blocks are where most of your content resides.

## Before you begin

Role required: content\_admin or admin

## About this task

A good use of dynamic blocks is job postings. Store the postings in knowledge articles and display the postings with a dynamic block.

Several dynamic blocks are predefined, including the following items.

-   **New Content**: Each of the new content blocks allows for creating blocks while editing content pages.
-   **Clean Login**: The default login page requesting user name and password, which includes a "Remember Me" check box. After the user logs in, this block triggers login rules.
-   **Login**: An area that allows a logged out user to log in and a logged in user to log out. This block is especially useful on publicly available content pages.
-   **Search**: The global text search field. Currently, global text search is the only form of search that can be included in a content page.
-   **Search Results**: An area for displaying global text search results.

**Note:** Dynamic Content Blocks in Content Management System are not automatically escaped. These blocks must implement their own content escaping \(e.g., to protect against potential Cross Site Scripting attacks\). For more information, see [Jelly escaping types](../../api-reference/scripts/r_JellyEscapingTypes.md).
