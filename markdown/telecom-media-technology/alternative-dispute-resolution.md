# Alternative dispute resolution management

Use the Alternative Dispute Resolution \(ADR\) case to resolve customer disputes efficiently while confirming transparency, accountability, and regulatory conformance.

## ADR overview

ADR is a specialized complaint management system within ServiceNow, Inc.'s CSM/FSM workspace. An ADR in the context of customer complaints is a formal process used to address and resolve disagreements between a customer and an organization. ADR extends the complaint case functionality to handle dispute resolution processes. The ADR case provides an end-to-end workflow that includes the necessary steps to resolve a customer complaint.

## ADR workflow

The ADR workflow begins when a customer raises a complaint regarding a product, service, billing issue, or contractual matter. As an ADR manager records the escalated complaint, captures requester details, the reviews the related complaint cases, and gathers relevant evidence. Then, communicate with the customer to understand the issue clearly and propose a solution. The objective is to investigate fairly, provide a justified response, and reach a mutually acceptable solution. If the customer accepts the resolution plan, the ADR manager creates the case tasks and resolves the customer issue. If the customer rejects the resolution plan and chooses to escalate the issue externally, the ADR manager issues and shares a deadlock letter with the customer.

|Component|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|ADR case type|Captures all necessary details, including the ADR category, customer information, and previous interaction history. Also includes partner contact information for disputes involving third parties.|
|Fact capture|Captures all facts, investigation details, findings, and proposed resolutions, such as credit notes or bill corrections.|
|Service Level Agreements \(SLAs\)|Defined and adhered to based on the severity of the ADR, confirming issues are addressed within specified timeframes to maintain customer trust and satisfaction.|
|Audit trail|Maintains a comprehensive record of all interactions and root cause analysis \(RCA\) details, including evidence, for reporting and compliance purposes.|
|Deadlock letter|Created in cases where a deadlock is reached, capturing the history and RCA of the ADR and informing the customer of the deadlock situation and dispute details.|

## ADR stages and activities
