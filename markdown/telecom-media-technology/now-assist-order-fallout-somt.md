# Now Assist for Sales CRM for Telecommunications AI agent Order fallout AI agent

Use the AI agent to automatically create the fallout records based on reported issues on the task's notes.

## Order fallout AI agent overview

Use the Order fallout AI agent to:

-   Eliminate manual review of completed orders by automatically analyzing work notes.
-   Reduce manual effort in the fallout creation and assignment process.
-   Ensure that all relevant fallouts are captured and linked to original order tasks.

The agent automatically creates a fallout in case of an order task failure. The agent identifies the correct category in which the fallout must be created. The agent doesn’t create a fallout if the fallout is already created.

This agent analyzes the order fulfillment tasks when a task status is changed to on hold and automatically creates relevant fallout records based on issues identified in work notes. It leverages Now LLM Service to match task observations with predefined fallout types, streamlining the post-fulfillment issue tracking process.

Order fallout AI agent performs the following task:

1.  Analyzes all the order task work notes.
2.  Identifies reported issues.
3.  Matches issues with available fallout types.
4.  Creates appropriate fallout records.
