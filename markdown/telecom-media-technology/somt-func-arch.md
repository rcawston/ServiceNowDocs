# Sales CRM for Telecommunications functional architecture

Sales CRM for Telecommunications is a comprehensive order management solution designed specifically for telecommunications service providers. Sales CRM for Telecommunications serves as a critical orchestration layer within the larger telecommunications ecosystem, integrating with key systems to manage the complete journey from prospect identification to service activation.

## Sales CRM for Telecommunications in the Telecommunications ecosystem

Sales CRM for Telecommunications is a critical application in the telecommunications industry, serving as the central orchestration layer for order management. It acts as a central hub connecting various systems across the telecom operator's landscape:

-   Customer-facing channels: Mobile apps, web portals, and sales representatives.
-   Supporting systems: Product catalogs, inventory systems, and service qualification platforms.
-   Fulfillment systems: Field service management and network activation platforms.

Sales CRM for Telecommunications leverages TeleManagement Forum \(TMF\) industry standards to manage telecommunications orders across both selling and fulfillment phases while integrating with multiple upstream and downstream systems.

## Foundation components

Sales CRM for Telecommunications is built on the following core data entities that underpin the entire order management process:

-   Account: Customer account information and organizational hierarchy.
-   Contact: Customer contact details and relationships.
-   Location/Site: Service delivery locations and site information.
-   Product Model: Product specifications and definitions created using the Product-Service-Resource \(PSR\) framework.
-   Sold Product: Customer's purchased products and entitlements
-   Install base item: Customer's product configuration.
-   Entitlements: Entitlements associated with the sold products.
-   Contracts: Customer contract including account details and specific assets covered.

These foundational elements provide the essential data structures that support all operations, from lead management through service activation. The Sales CRM for Telecommunications functional architecture operates across two distinct phases: the Selling Phase and the Fulfillment Phase.

## Selling phase

This phase covers the customer acquisition and order capture process:

-   Lead Management: Initial prospect identification
-   Opportunity Management: Sales opportunity qualification
-   Product Catalog: Product offerings and configurations
-   Sales Agreement: Pre-sales contractual arrangements
-   Shopping Cart: Customer selection management
-   Quote: Pricing and proposal generation \(CPQ\)
-   Contract: Post-sales contractual obligations
-   Order Capture: Final order submission

During this phase, Sales CRM for Telecommunications integrates with digital apps, self-care portals, account managers, product catalogs, and service feasibility systems.

## Fulfillment phase

After order submission, the next phase is the fulfillment process:

-   Order Distribution: Decomposition into service orders and work orders.
-   Service Order Management: Tracking through activation lifecycle.
-   Activation Handoff: Submission to provisioning systems.

During this phase, Sales CRM for Telecommunications coordinates with Field Service Management for Telecommunication, external inventory systems, and network activation platforms.

**Note:** Sales CRM for Telecommunications orchestrates the order management process and submits service orders to downstream activation systems but does not perform network activation or provisioning.
