# Create and publish resource specifications

Create and publish a base version of a resource specification to define all the resource options for a customer-facing product that you sell and to designate how to fulfill these options.

## Before you begin

Create characteristics, characteristic options, and specification categories. To learn more about characteristics, characteristic options, and specification categories, see:

-   [Create product characteristics and characteristic options](../order-management/som-product-config-add-characteristics.md)
-   [Create and associate specification categories with model categories](../order-management/create-associate-specification-categories.md)

Role required: sn\_prd\_pm.product\_catalog\_manager

## About this task

You create a resource specification to define the technical information for a resource, which includes the following:

-   All the specification characteristic options that are available for a resource, and how they should be fulfilled.
-   Various categories of information, such as the manufacture, model, and brand-related information about a resource, including the resource visuals and activation guides. Resource specifications are not customer-facing.
-   Its relationship to other product, service, and resource specifications. You can enable the product and service delivery by using the required resource.

2.  Navigate to **Specifications** &gt; **Resource specifications**.
