# Create specification relationships, quantity mapping, and decomposition rules for Sales CRM for Telecommunications

Create the specification relationships and optional decomposition rules that define the associations between the product, service, and resource specifications for a product that you offer. These relationships impact how an order is fulfilled for a customer.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_prd\_pm.product\_catalog\_manager

## About this task

Specification relationships define the relationships and associations between the product, service, and resource specifications. They designate how an order that contains the source specification is decomposed, fulfilled, and delivered to the customer. For example, if you have a product that you deliver through a service specification, you can designate that it is composed of three unique service specifications \(product, service, or resource\).

**Note:** The target product, service, or resource specification you select in the **Target Specification** field can be in any state, including a Draft state. The selected specification does not have to be published before selecting it in this field.

You can also select the characteristic options of the quantity characteristic for the specification relationship to provide the quantity of the target specifications. The order decomposition process refers to the mapped quantity to decompose the order for the source specification and creates the required number of domain orders for the target specification.

Optionally, you can create decomposition rules for the selected source and target specification relationships. The specification relationships can have product, service, or resource specifications as the source specifications.

**Note:** To learn more, see [Order decomposition](../order-management/order-mgt-order-decomposition.md).

## Procedure

1.  Open CSM Configurable Workspace.

2.  Navigate to **List** &gt; **Specifications** and select a specification type.

    -   Product Specifications
    -   Service Specifications
    -   Resource Specifications
    A list of specification records is displayed.

3.  Select a record you want to modify.

4.  Navigate to the **Specification Relationships** tab.

5.  Select **New**.

6.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_ytw_wcr_4nb"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Source specification

</td><td>

Product, service, or resource specification that you create the relationship from.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Target type

</td><td>

Type of specification:-   Product Specification
-   Service Specification
-   Resource Specification


</td></tr><tr><td>

Target specification

</td><td>

The target product, service, or resource specification you select can be in any state, including a Draft state. The selected specification does not have to be published before selecting it in this field.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Mandatory

</td><td>

Option that designates if the relationship between the selected source and target specifications is mandatory and should always exist when a customer orders the product.-   If selected, the target specification is always included with the source specification. During the ordering process,you must select the characteristics and characteristic values for the target specification.
-   If cleared, it is an optional target specification and is only included with the product if the customer selected it during the ordering process.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Relationship type

</td><td>

Type of relationship that designates how an order that contains the source specification decomposes for fulfillment after you receive and approve it. -   **Composed of** is applicable for following specification:
    -   If the source specification is product specification and selected target is product specification.

An order that contains the source specification and characteristics decompose into a single service order.

    -   If the source specification is service specification and selected target is service specification.
    -   If the resource specification is source specification and selected target is also resource specification.
-   **Realized as** is applicable for following specification:
    -   If the source specification is product specification and selected target is service specification.
    -   If the source specification is service specification and selected target is service specification.
-   **Bundles** is applicable for following specification:
    -   If the source specification is product specification and selected target is product specification.

An order that contains the source specification and characteristics decompose into unique order line items for each of the target specifications bundled from that parent product specification.

    -   If the source specification is service specification and selected target is service specification.
    -   If the resource specification is source specification and selected target is also resource specification.
-   **Requires** is applicable for following specification:
    -   If the product specification is product specification and selected target is resource specification.

To enable the delivery of the promised services in the specification, an order that contains the source specification and characteristics also requires the target resource specification.

    -   If the service specification is service specification and selected target is resource specification.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Order

</td><td>

Enter a numeric value that represents the order in which this relationship is applied, if there is more than one relationship.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Minimum quantity

</td><td>

Required minimum number of specifications for an order.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Default quantity

</td><td>

Default quantity if there is no selected amount.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Maximum quantity

</td><td>

Maximum quantity of specifications.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Quantity characteristic

</td><td>

Source specification characteristic that is used for quantity mapping. The quantity characteristic is supported only for a specification relationship in a product specification.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>7.  Select **Save**.


## What to do next

Optionally, create decomposition rules for selected specification relationships that have a product, service, or resource specification as the source specification.
