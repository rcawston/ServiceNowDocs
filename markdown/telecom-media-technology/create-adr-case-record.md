# Create an Alternative Dispute Resolution case

Create an Alternative Dispute Resolution \(ADR\) case record in the CSM/FSm Configurable Workspace so that you can investigate and resolve an escalated complaint.

## About this task

At the initial stage, you capture the complaint initiator details and complaint details. Throughout the investigation, all relevant interactions, updates, and findings are captured within the ADR case record. After completion of the review, you propose the resolution with the customer. If the customer accepts the resolution, close the case accordingly. If the customer doesn't accept the resolution, generate and issue a deadlock letter to conclude the internal complaint process formally. The ADR case record details are captured in the ADR Complaint \[sn\_telco\_adr\_mgmt\_complaint\] table.
