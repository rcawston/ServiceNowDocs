# Task plan templates driven order fulfillment

Use the task plan template to define tasks and their dependencies that are needed to orchestrate the fulfillment journey for a product to standardize fulfillment processes across products.

A no-code approach in ServiceNow® that allows you to create task orchestration workflows using task plan templates. It as an alternative to flow designer, giving more options for implementing product configurations.

For more information about Flow actions for fulfillment subflow definition, see [Flow actions for fulfillment subflow definition](../order-management/order-mgt-flow-actions-fulfillment-subflows.md).

When the template is configured for a specification, the out of box logic, on domain order creation automatically searches for a matching template, based on the task's specification and action of domain order. When a template match is found, the template is applied to generate the order tasks under the domain order. To learn more about task plan template, see [Task plan templates](../customer-service-management/task-plan-templates.md).
