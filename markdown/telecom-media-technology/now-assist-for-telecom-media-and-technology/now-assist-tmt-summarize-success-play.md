# Summarize a customer play using Now Assist for Telecommunications, Media and Technology \(TMT\)

Generate a summary from a customer play record and all associated customer play tasks.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_acct\_lc.customer\_success\_agent

## About this task

The customer play summary skill provides you with a summary of the customer play record and associated customer play tasks. This skill available in CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace and in Core UI.

-   In CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace, you use the Customer play summary by Now Assist component to generate a summary. This component appears above the Activities card.
-   In Core UI, you select the **Summarize** button on the customer play record to generate a summary.

**Note:** The customer play summarization skill must be active. If it isn’t active, summaries are generated using the out of the box case summarization skill.

The customer play summarization skill checks the record to determine if there is enough information available to create a summary:

-   When an agent opens the customer play record.
-   When an agent refreshes the customer play record page.

**Note:** The customer play summarization skill requires a minimum 50 words in the record to generate the summary.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace** &gt; **Lists** &gt; **All Customer plays**.

2.  Open a customer play and select **Summarize**.

    The Customer play summary by Now Assist component appears above the Activities card. The component is collapsed by default and expands to display the summary. Based on the inputs provided in the Engagement, account, and Short Description, the summary is generated with the following details:

    -   Overview: Summarizes the primary goal \(subject, description\), engagement, account, product, progress, due date, squad, and customer contact details.
    -   Progress updates: Summarizes current status \(work notes, recent emails\), details of meetings associated with the customer play, total number of customer play tasks, number of open and closed tasks.
    -   Next steps: Shows a summary list of all open customer play tasks, required agent actions, scheduled meetings, and tasks that are due in the next 7 days.
    **Note:** Generating and displaying the summary may take several seconds. For longer summaries that don't fit in the window, select **View more** and use the scroll bar to view the rest of the content.

3.  After you're finished summarizing the customer play, manage the results.
