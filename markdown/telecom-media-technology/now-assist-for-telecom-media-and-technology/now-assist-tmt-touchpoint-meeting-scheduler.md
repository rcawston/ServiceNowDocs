# Now Assist for Telecommunications, Media and Technology \(TMT\) AI agent collection trigger risk mitigation touchpoint

Use the Trigger risk mitigation touchpoint agentic workflow to schedule and edit a touchpoint meeting for a specific user.

## Trigger risk mitigation touchpoint agentic workflow overview

The agentic workflow enables customer success agents to optimize meeting schedules within the customer success workflow by creating and managing meetings. It create and manage meetings based on key details such as invitees, agenda, meeting type, and scheduling preferences. With this agentic workflow, customer success managers can:

-   Take timely and contextual action.
-   Create a meeting with all required details.
-   Schedule draft meetings without manual coordination.

In the Trigger risk mitigation touchpoint agentic workflow, when the risk record's probability is very high or occurred, the customer success agent is assigned to that risk receives a Now Assist panel notification. From the risk record, the agentic workflow automates the creation of meeting and schedules the meeting.

To modify the Trigger risk mitigation touchpoint agentic workflow [Duplicate an agentic workflow](../../intelligent-experiences/clone-aia-usecase.md), and adjust the settings according to your requirements.

**Note:** You can use Now LLM Service, Azure OpenAI, Google Gemini or Anthropic Claude on AWS as the AI model provider for all Now Assist skills and AI agents. Use the Configuration Controls in [AI Control tower](../../intelligent-experiences/ai-control-tower/ai-model-providers.md) to define which options are available, then set the skill-level preferences in the [Now Assist Admin console](../../intelligent-experiences/manage-large-language-models.md). For more information, see [Large language models on the ServiceNow AI Platform®](../../intelligent-experiences/servicenow-large-language-model-now-llm/exploring-large-language-models.md).

## Role masking

Required role: sn\_acct\_lc.customer\_success\_agent

Agentic workflows and their AI agents use [role masking](../../intelligent-experiences/aia-role-masking.md) to determine which users can access them. Ones installed with Now Assist applications have specific roles that come included with the application. If you select **Users with specific roles** for user access, you must configure the security controls to include these roles. For the instructions to change the security controls, see [Define security controls for an agentic workflow](../../intelligent-experiences/define-sec-controls-aw.md).
