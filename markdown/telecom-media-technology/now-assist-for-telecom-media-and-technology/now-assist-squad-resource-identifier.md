# Now Assist for Telecommunications, Media and Technology \(TMT\) AI agent collection Squad resource identifier agentic workflow

Use a squad resource identifier agentic workflow to identify and recommend internal experts based on record under consideration, skill set, region, and real-time availability.

## Squad resource identifier agentic workflow overview

The agentic workflow assists the customer success teams to quickly identify and connect with the right individuals to support success plays, initiatives, or critical escalations, ensuring faster and more effective collaboration across engagements.

The Squad resource identifier agentic workflow supports these tables:

-   Touchpoint \(sn\_acct\_lc\_touchpoint\)
-   Account Onboarding Case \(sn\_acct\_lc\_onb\_case\)
-   Success Task \(sn\_acct\_lc\_success\_task\)
-   Engagement \(sn\_acct\_lc\_engagement\)
-   Implementation Record \(sn\_acct\_lc\_implementation\_record\)
-   Customer Play \(sn\_acct\_lc\_success\_case\)
-   Success Initiative \(sn\_acct\_lc\_success\_initiative\)
-   Internal Play \(sn\_acct\_lc\_internal\_play\)
-   Internal Play Task \(sn\_acct\_lc\_internal\_play\_task\)
-   Risk Signal and Issue \(sn\_acct\_lc\_risk\_signal\_issue\)
-   Onboarding Task \(sn\_ti\_core\_task\)
-   Data Import Task \(sn\_ti\_core\_imp\_task\)

Role required: sn\_acct\_lc.customer\_success\_agent and sn\_acct\_lc.agent

To configure the Squad resource identifier agentic workflow, see [Squad Resource Identifier AI Workflow: Setup and Configuration Guide](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?sys_kb_id=99f441a747d6365077748d01426d433a&id=kb_article_view).

To modify the Squad resource identifier agentic workflow, [Duplicate an agentic workflow](../../intelligent-experiences/clone-aia-usecase.md), and adjust the settings according to your requirements.

**Important:** In the Edit trigger form, make sure that the **Active** button is turned on to enable the AI agent to trigger autonomously.

## Assign customer success role

The squad members assigned through the squad resource identifier workflow aren’t automatically granted customer success roles. An administrator must manually assign the appropriate role to enable record access.

To assign customer success roles to users using the ServiceNow AI Platform user administration feature, see [Assign a role to a user](../../platform-administration/user-administration/t_AssignARoleToAUser.md).
