# Summarize a touchpoint using Now Assist for Telecommunications, Media and Technology \(TMT\)

Generate a summary from the fields you select on the touchpoint record. Get a quick summary of all the meetings and emails exchanged between different stakeholders and any follow up activities.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_acct\_lc.agent

## About this task

The touchpoint summary skill provides you with a concise summary of the different touchpoints in the engagement lifecycle. With this skill you can do the following tasks:

-   Generate an initial summary of the touchpoint so that you can understand the context.
-   Summarize all the work associated with a touchpoint.

The touchpoint summarization skill is available in CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace and in Core UI.

-   In CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace, you use the Touchpoint summary by Now Assist component to generate a summary. This component appears above the Account details card.
-   In Core UI, you select the **Summarize** button on the touchpoint record to generate a summary.

**Note:** The touchpoint summarization skill must be active. If it isn’t active, summaries are generated using the out of the box case summarization skill.

The engagement summarization skill checks the touchpoint record to determine if there is enough information available to create a summary:

-   When an agent opens the touchpoint record
-   When an agent refreshes the touchpoint record page

If there is enough data, the Touchpoint summary component displays the **Summarize** button. If there is not enough data, the component displays a message in place of the button.

**Note:** The touchpoint summarization skill requires a minimum 50 words in the record to generate the summary.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace** &gt; **Lists** &gt; **All Touchpoints**.

2.  Open an touchpoint.

3.  In the Touchpoint summary by Now Assist component, select **Summarize**.

    The Touchpoint summary by Now Assist component appears above the Account details card. The component is collapsed by default and expands to display the summary. For longer summaries that don't fit in the window, select **View more** and use the scroll bar to view the rest of the content.

    **Note:** Generating and displaying the summary may take several seconds.

4.  After you're finished summarizing an engagement, manage the results.
