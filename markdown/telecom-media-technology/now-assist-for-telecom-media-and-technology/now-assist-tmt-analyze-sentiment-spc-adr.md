# Analyze the sentiment of a service problem case using Now Assist for TMT

Generates the requester's sentiment and the reasoning behind it on the complaint cases in the Now Assist for TMT application. Make informed decisions on complaint cases based on sentiment to link the cases on the Alternative Dispute Resolution \(ADR\) case record.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_telco\_adr\_mgmt.manager

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace** &gt; **Lists** &gt; **Alternative Dispute Resolution** &gt; **All**.

2.  Open the ADR case that you are working on.

3.  Select Investigate stage.

4.  On the Lookup record history activity, under the Relevant record section, navigate to the complaint cases.

5.  Select the information icon \(![More info icon.](../image/icon-more-info.png)\).

    The Customer sentiment component appears and provides an explanation for why that sentiment was given.

    The Customer Sentiment component shows the assigned sentiment and explains why that sentiment was given.

    **Note:** Generating and displaying the summary may take several seconds.

**Provide feedback for the summary**

-   If you think that the sentiment information was helpful, select the helpful icon \(![Helpful icon.](../image/icon-helpful.png)\).
-   If you think that the sentiment information wasn’t helpful, select the not helpful icon \(![Not helpful icon.](../image/icon-not-helpful.png)\).
 This feedback improves the generative AI model and can help to improve the future versions of this skill. The system gathers the feedback on each generated sentiment information and stores it in the generative AI logs \(sys\_generative\_ai\_log\_list.do\).
