# Now Assist for Telecommunications, Media and Technology \(TMT\) Support renewals and expansion

Assess engagements and contracts due for renewal, analyze trends, and recommend renewal strategies.

## Support renewals and expansion agentic workflow overview

The Support renewals and expansion agentic workflow enables customer success agents to assess the health, value, and product adoption of an engagement or contract. It provides data-driven insights and renewal play recommendations and enables customer success agents to manage multiple customer engagements efficiently. The workflow uses the Renewal Insight Engine skill to evaluate individual product metrics, health score trends, usage trends, and value scores at both the engagement and contract level, providing more granular insights than the earlier decision table-based approach. See [Renewal insight engine skill](renewal-insight.md)for details.

Customer success managers can use the Support renewals and expansion agentic workflow to:

-   Track how much value has been delivered since onboarding.
-   Measure progress against goals and service delivery metrics.
-   Retrieve and calculate health and adoption scores.
-   Analyze trends to support informed adoption and engagement decisions.
-   Generate renewal likelihood assessments and expansion potential at the engagement and contract level.
-   Receive up to three recommended actions, each with a specific play type, target product, priority, and reasoning.

**Note:** The Support renewals and expansion agentic workflow is available in read-only mode. Before using the workflow, you must make a copy and adjust the settings according to your requirements. See [Duplicate an agentic workflow](../../intelligent-experiences/clone-aia-usecase.md) for details.

## Configure the Support renewals and expansion agentic workflow

Before you use the agentic workflow, you must do the following:

-   Activate the Renewal Insight Engine skill in Now Assist for TMT. The skill is inactive by default and must be manually activated. See [Renewal insight engine skill](renewal-insight.md) for details.
-   Configure the following fields in the Renewal analysis AI agent:
    -   Engagement adoption source sysID
    -   Contract adoption source sysID
    -   Health source sysID
    -   Time period \(in days\)
    -   Metric aggregation type

**Note:** The source sysIDs must be configured correctly in the Data Context Engine as follows:

-   Health: Source and context table must be set to Engagement.
-   Engagement: Source table must be set to Sold Products and the context table must be set to Engagement.
-   Contract: Source table must be set to Sold Products and the context table must be set to Contract.

For more details on configuring the data sources, see [Set up the Data Context Engine](../../acct-lifecycle-events/account-lifecycle-setup-dce.md).

## Support renewals and expansion agentic workflow

**Note:** Before running the workflow, you must configure the generic prompt as follows:

1.  Navigate to the OneExtend Capability \(sys\_one\_extend\_capability\) table by entering `sys_one_extend_capability.list` in the navigator.
2.  Search for `generic prompt` and open the record.
3.  In OneExtend Capability Attributes related list, set the **Default** to **True** for any of these definitions:
    -   Generic Prompt \(Azure OpenAI Chat\)
    -   Generic Prompt \(Now LLM\)
    -   Generic Prompt Vertex AI \(Google Cloud Chat Completion\)
    -   Generic Prompt \(Amazon Bedrock Chat Completions\)

When a contract is due to expire in 90 days, the customer success manager receives a notification and the Support renewals and expansion workflow is automatically triggered. The customer success manager can monitor the progress in the [Now Assist panel](../../intelligent-experiences/now-assist-panel-overview.md) and select one of the following scans:

-   Value
-   Health
-   Usage
-   Value &amp; Health
-   Health &amp; Usage
-   Value &amp; Usage
-   Value &amp; Usage &amp; Health

When the workflow is completed, two reports are generated for the engagement and the associated contract \(that is due to expire in 90 days\) with the following details:

-   Renewal likelihood
-   Expansion potential
-   Recommended actions
-   Adoption trend
-   Health trend
-   Value score

You can then select the appropriate renewal play based on the report.

## Testing the agentic workflow

To access the use case testing page:

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Agent Studio** &gt; **Testing**.
2.  On the Overview page, select **Support renewals and expansion**.

To test the use case, see [Manually test the execution of an agentic workflow](../../intelligent-experiences/test-aia-use-case.md).
