# Summarize an internal play using Now Assist for Telecommunications, Media and Technology \(TMT\)

Generate a summary from a internal play record and all associated internal play tasks.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_acct\_lc.customer\_success\_agent

## About this task

The internal play summary skill provides you with a summary of the internal play record and associated internal play tasks. This skill available in CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace and in Core UI.

-   In CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace, you use the Internal play summary by Now Assist component to generate a summary. This component appears above the Activities card.
-   In Core UI, you select the **Summarize** button on the internal play record to generate a summary.

The internal play summarization skill checks the record to determine if there is enough information available to create a summary:

-   When an agent opens the internal play record.
-   When an agent refreshes the internal play record page.

**Note:** The internal play summarization skill requires a minimum 50 words in the record to generate the summary.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace** &gt; **Lists** &gt; **All Internal plays**.

2.  Open an internal play and select **Summarize**.

    The Internal play summary by Now Assist component appears above the Activities card. The component is collapsed by default and expands to display the summary. Based on the inputs provided in the Engagement, account, and Short Description, the summary is generated with the following details:

    -   Overview: Summarizes primary goal \(subject, description\), engagement, account, product, progress, due date, squad, and details of any contracts under consideration.
    -   Progress updates: Summarizes current status \(work notes, recent emails\), total number of internal play tasks, number of open and closed tasks.
    -   Next steps: Shows a summary list of all open internal play tasks, required agent actions, and tasks that are due in the next 7 days.
    **Note:** Generating and displaying the summary may take several seconds. For longer summaries that don't fit in the window, select **View more** and use the scroll bar to view the rest of the content.

3.  After you're finished summarizing the internal play, manage the results.
