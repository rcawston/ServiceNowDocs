# Exploring Now Assist for Telecommunications, Media and Technology \(TMT\)

With the Now Assist for Telecommunications, Media and Technology \(TMT\) application, your agents can use generative AI to summarize service problem cases, account onboarding cases, engagements, touchpoints, internal plays, customer plays, successive initiatives, tests, risk signal and issues, and generate resolution notes. Additionally, you can automate transformation mapping between provider and consumer instances in Service Exchange.

## Overview of Now Assist for TMT

The following generative AI capabilities are available:

-   **Telecommunications Now Assist capabilities**
    -   The Telecom Customer 360 insights generation automatically generates AI-powered insights for a customer or consumer account.
    -   A service problem case sentiment analysis enables you to understand the customer sentiment on a service problem case.
    -   A comprehensive summary of linked records enables you to generate a summary of linked records of an escalated complaint in the Alternative Dispute Resolution \(ADR\) case.
    -   A deadlock letter draft generation enables you to generate the deadlock letter for an ADR case. If the customer rejects the resolution plan, you can share the deadlock letter with the customer.
    -   A resolution notes generation enables the agent to create a resolution plan for an escalated complaint in the ADR case record.
    -   A service problem case summary enables an agent to gather the case context on long-running or complex cases. Because these cases can contain several details, including conversation with customers or other agents, generating a summary can help agents to get a quicker understanding of the case.
    -   The case resolution notes can help an agent to wrap up cases faster and provide the context about the case resolution to the other agents who might encounter similar issues.
    -   A test summary assists an agent with obtaining the test results that were generated after executing the test runs. It provides a high-level overview of the test run in a clear format.
    -   Knowledge generation can help an agent to streamline content creation. An agent can automatically generate knowledge articles by using the relevant data from the case record after proposing a resolution or closing the case. By not having to generate knowledge articles manually, this feature can save your agents valuable time and effort.
    -   The customer service summary skill provides you with a concise summary of a sold product, including the current situation, root cause indicators, critical actions, and resolution details.
    -   Remote Hands Agents can generate a case summary from both the Remote Hands Case table and the CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace using the Summarize option. The summary provides a consolidated overview of the case, including key case details and related case summary for quick understanding.
-   **Technology Now Assist capabilities**
    -   A draft closure notes for a risk signal automatically generates closure notes and closes eligible risk signals at the end of each day based on the status of their associated risk solutions.
    -   A lookup similar engagements skill to automatically generate a product adoption roadmap based on engagement data and insights from similar engagements.
    -   A renewal insight engine skill to analyze the renewal likelihood and expansion potential of an engagement or contract and generate recommended actions.
    -   An account onboarding case summary enables an agent to gather case context on onboarding cases. Agents can generate a summary to gain an understanding of any stage of the onboarding cycle.
    -   An engagement record summary can enable an agent to summarize initiatives, outcomes, risks, and internal plays associated with an engagement.
    -   A touchpoint record summary can enable an agent to summarize meetings and emails exchanged during the engagement life cycle.
    -   A customer play record summary that includes details of the record and all the associated tasks.
    -   A internal play record summary that includes details of the record and all the associated tasks.
    -   A success initiative record summary that includes details of the record and all the associated tasks.
    -   Collects and analyzes metric data, processes large data sets, identifies patterns and anomalies.
    -   Transform map assist enables providers to automatically generate transform maps between provider and consumer tables.
    -   The risk signal and issues summarization skill provides you with a summary of risk history and resolution context.
