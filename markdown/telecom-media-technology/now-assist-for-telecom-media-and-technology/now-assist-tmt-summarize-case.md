# Summarize a service problem case using Now Assist for Telecommunications, Media and Technology \(TMT\)

Generate a summary from the fields that you selected on the service problem case record. Quickly understand the case context by using the service problem case summarization skill in the Now Assist for TMT application.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_customerservice\_agent, sn\_customerservice.consumer\_agent

## About this task

The service problem case summarization skill provides you with a concise summary of a service problem case, including the issue, actions taken, and resolution details. With this skill, you can do the following tasks:

-   Generate an initial summary of a service problem case so that you can understand the service problem case context.
-   Summarize all the work that has been done on a service problem case.

The service problem case summarization skill is available in CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace and in Core UI.

-   In CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace, you use the Service Problem Case summary by Now Assist component to generate a summary. This component appears below the Case highlights card.
-   In Core UI, you select the **Summarize** button on the service problem case record to generate a summary.

The service problem case summarization skill checks the service problem case record to determine if there is enough information available to create a summary:

-   When an agent opens the service problem case record
-   When an agent refreshes the service problem case record page

If there is enough data, the Service Problem Case summary component displays the **Summarize** button. If there is not enough data, the component displays a message in place of the button.

**Note:** The service problem case summarization skill requires a minimum 50 words in the case record to generate the summary.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace** &gt; **Lists** &gt; **Service Problem Case**.

2.  Open a service problem case.

3.  In the Service Problem Case summary by Now Assist component, select **Summarize**.

    The Service Problem Case summary by Now Assist component appears below the Case highlights card. The component is collapsed by default and expands to display the summary. For longer summaries that don't fit in the window, select **View more** and use the scroll bar to view the rest of the content.

    **Note:** Generating and displaying the summary may take several seconds.

4.  After you're finished summarizing a service problem case, manage the results.
