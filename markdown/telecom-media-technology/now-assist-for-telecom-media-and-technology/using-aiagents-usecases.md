Available AI agents

Test and repair telecom service issues

</td><td>

The agentic workflow gets triggered when the service problem case is assigned to the case agent and the state of the case is Open or New. The customer raises a case on the service disruption.

 The service problem case \(SPC\) starts with the SPC number.

 This AI agent is designed to handle the service problem case requests that require troubleshooting, diagnostics, analysis, or resolution for a task \(case\), when an identifier or description for the task is given. It’s also capable of retrieving relevant context and details related to the task given to them.

 AI agents perform their tasks to resolve the customer issue.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Help remediate bill issues

</td><td>

The agentic workflow is designed to handle billing inquiry requests by analyzing current invoice usage, providing insights into high bill usage, and suggesting alternative plans based on customer usage patterns. For example, if a customer with a domestic mobile connection uses it internationally, they may incur extra charges; our bill analysis can identify such international usage and provide optimal plan to help manage costs.

</table>Enable security implementation to execute AI agents and agentic workflows through access control lists \(ACLs\) and user identities. ACLs provide the Run As capability to let agents and agentic workflows execute actions either as a dynamic user or as an AI user. For more information, see [Implement access control in Now Assist AI agents](../../intelligent-experiences/aia-security-implementation.md).

**Important:** By default, all agentic workflows and AI agent records are read only.

To run the AI agents autonomously, you must first duplicate the agentic workflow, and then proceed with the following steps:

-   Activate the agentic workflow.
-   Activate all agents within the agentic workflow.
-   Activate the trigger to invoke the agentic workflow automatically. If you prefer to invoke it manually, activating the trigger isn’t necessary.

Once you [duplicate](../../intelligent-experiences/clone-aia-usecase.md) the agentic workflow, adjust the settings according to your requirements. Next, you [activate](../../intelligent-experiences/activate-aia-use-case.md) the duplicated agentic workflow. You can also [test](../../intelligent-experiences/test-aia-use-case.md) the agentic workflow to analyze its performance in the AI Agent Studio, while it executes the instructions that you defined.

There might be AI agents installed with the Now Assist application that are not used in agentic workflows. To learn how to see all agents that are available to you, see [Find AI agents](../../intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md).
