# Summarize an account onboarding case using Now Assist for Telecommunications, Media and Technology \(TMT\)

Generate a summary from the fields that you selected on the account onboarding case record. Quickly understand the case context by using the account onboarding case summarization skill in the Now Assist for TMT application.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_acct\_lc.agent

## About this task

The account onboarding case summarization skill provides you with a concise summary including details about each stage in the account boarding lifecycle. With this skill, you can do the following tasks:

-   Generate an initial summary of an account onboarding case so that you can understand the onboarding case context.
-   Summarize all the work that has been done on an account onboarding case.

The account onboarding case summarization skill is available in CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace and in Core UI.

-   In CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace, you use the Account Onboarding Case summary by Now Assist component to generate a summary. This component appears above the Activities card.
-   In Core UI, you select the **Summarize** button on the account onboarding case record to generate a summary.

**Note:** The account onboarding case summarization skill must be active. If it isn’t active, summaries are generated using the out of the box case summarization skill.

The account onboarding case summarization skill checks the record to determine if there’s enough information available to create a summary:

-   When an agent opens the account onboarding case record.
-   When an agent refreshes the account onboarding case record page.

If there’s enough data, the Account Onboarding Case summary component displays the **Summarize** button. If there isn’t enough data, the component displays a message in place of the button.

**Note:** The account onboarding case summarization skill requires a minimum 50 words in the case record to generate the summary.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace** &gt; **Lists** &gt; **Account Onboarding Case**.

2.  Open an account onboarding case.

3.  In the Account Onboarding Case summary by Now Assist component, select **Summarize**.

    The Account Onboarding Case summary by Now Assist component appears above the Activities card. The component is collapsed by default and expands to display the summary. For longer summaries that don't fit in the window, select **View more** and use the scroll bar to view the rest of the content.

    **Note:** Generating and displaying the summary may take several seconds.

4.  After you're finished summarizing an account onboarding case, manage the results.
