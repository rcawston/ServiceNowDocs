# Summarize test for a technology product support case using Now Assist for Telecommunications, Media and Technology \(TMT\)

Generate the test run summary for a technology product support case record to understand the context of test outcomes and the root cause of the problem.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_customerservice\_agent and sn\_customerservice.consumer\_agent

## About this task

The test summarization skill provides you with a concise summary of the test executed for a technology product support case, including the test outcome, test interpretation, and other parameters configured for the specific test definition. With this skill, you can generate the test summary of a technology product support case so that you can analyze the root cause of the problem.

The test summarization skill is available in CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace and in Core UI.

-   In CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace, you use the Test Run summary by Now Assist component to generate a summary. This component appears in the test results record.
-   In Core UI, you select the **Summarize** button on the test result record to generate a summary.

The test summarization skill checks the test results record to determine if there’s enough information available to create a summary. If there’s enough data, the Test summary component displays the **Summarize** button. If there isn’t enough data to generate a summary, the system displays a message in the Test summary component field.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace** &gt; **Lists** &gt; **Technology Product Support Case**.

2.  Open a technology product support case.

    If there are no test results available, run the tests to get test results.

3.  In the **Troubleshoot** tab, select **Test results**.

4.  Identify the test result that you want to open and select the View Details icon \(![View details](../image/mab-icon-launch-weblink-sol.png)\)

5.  In the Test Run summary by Now Assist component, select **Summarize**.

    The Test Run summary by Now Assist component appears in the test result record. The component is collapsed by default and expands to display the summary. For longer summaries that don't fit in the window, select **View more** and use the scroll bar to view the rest of the content.

    **Note:** Generating and displaying the summary may take several seconds.

6.  After you're finished summarizing the test for the technology product support case, manage the results.
