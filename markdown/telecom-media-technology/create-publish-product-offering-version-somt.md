# Create and publish a product offering version

Create and publish a version of an existing product offering in a Published state so that you can offer an improved version of it in your product catalog.

## Before you begin

Before you can create a version of a product offering, an initial base version of the product offering must exist and already be published. The type of information that you supply for a new version is the same as what you entered for an initial base version, but with certain differences. To learn more, see [Create and publish your product offerings to a catalog](create-product-offerings-somt.md).

Role required: sn\_prd\_pm.product-catalog\_manager

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Product Catalog Management** &gt; **Product Offering**.

2.  In the Product Offerings list, select the product offering that you want to create a version for.

3.  On the form, select **Create New Version**, and then fill in the fields.

    The manner in which you create a version of a product offering is similar to how you created its initial version with the following exceptions.

    **Note:** For information about the remaining field descriptions, see [Product Offering Versions form](../order-management/field-descriptions-product-offering-form.md)

4.  To reflect the engineering changes that were made to the physical product, update the product offering version:

    1.  To update the characteristics that are associated with your product offering, use the Product Offering Characteristics related list.
    2.  To update the product visuals for your versioned product offering, use the Product Visuals related lists.
    3.  **Note:** To learn more, see [Create and publish your product offerings to a catalog](../order-management/order-mgt-product-offerings.md).

5.  When you finish creating the product offering version, do one of the following actions.

<table id="choicetable_product_offering"><thead><tr><th align="left" id="d27700e134">

Action

</th><th align="left" id="d27700e137">

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td id="d27700e143">

**Publish**

</td><td>

Publish the draft product offering so that you can use it in a product catalog:-   When you publish it, its state changes from Draft to Published.
-   After you publish a product offering, you can't change or delete it, unless you create a version for it.


</td></tr><tr><td id="d27700e161">

**Update**

</td><td>

Update the product offering with the new data that you added, but don't publish it for use in a product catalog.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d27700e170">

**Copy**

</td><td>

Copy the data in this product offering so that you can create a product offering from it. For example, you can use the Copy function if you want to create a base version product offering that is similar to Premium SD-WAN Offering v3, but with a separate version track.

 When you use the Copy function, it creates a base version product offering and sets the values in these fields:

-   **Version**: 1 \(base version\)
-   **Initial Version**: Premium SD-WAN Offering v3
-   **Previous Version**: blank


</td></tr></tbody>
