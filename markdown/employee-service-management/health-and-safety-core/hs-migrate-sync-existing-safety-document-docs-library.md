# Migrate existing safety documents to the Document library

Migrate your existing safety documents from the deprecated **Standards and Documents** list to the new **Health and Safety document library** list.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ohs\_im.admin

## About this task

To securely maintain version control of safety documents across multiple languages and locations, Health and Safety applications now use the ServiceNow® Document Management \(com.snc.platform\_document\_management\) plugin. The previous **Standards and Documents** list and its associated table \[sn\_ohs\_im\_document\] have been deprecated.

Use the Document Migration tool to seamlessly move your existing safety documents from the deprecated table to the new **Health and Safety document library** list. This new list is based on the Health and Safety document \[sn\_ohs\_im\_document\_v2\] table. The tool supports batch migration of up to 200 records at a time. After migration, all documents can be efficiently managed within the new list.![image.hs-document-migration-tool]

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Health and Safety** &gt; **Standards and documentation \(Deprecated\)** &gt; **Document migration**.

2.  Select **Health and Safety document \(Deprecated\)** \(sn\_ohs\_im\_document\) and then select **Migrate records**.

    A batch of up to 200 documents are migrated and listed in the **Migration records** list.

3.  Repeat step 2 until you have migrated all existing document records.


## Result

-   All migration records with their migration status and logs are listed in the **Migration records** list.
-   The count of documents that have successfully migrated, documents pending migration, and failed migration are listed in the **Migrated records**, **Remaining records**, and **Fail records** widgets.
-   The successfully migrated records appear in the new **Health and Safety document library** list under **Configuration**, and are saved in the Health and Safety document \[sn\_ohs\_im\_document\_v2\] table.
