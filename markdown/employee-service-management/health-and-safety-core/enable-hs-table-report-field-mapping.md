2.  In the property **Report field mapping tables**, add the table name, for example, `sn_ohs_im_action`, to enable it for report field mapping.

    `sn_ohs_im_incident`, `sn_ohs_im_observation`, and `sn_ohs_im_injury_illness` tables are set as default value in this property.

3.  Select **Save**.


## Result
