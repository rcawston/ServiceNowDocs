# Generate a knowledge article from multiple cases

Create drafts of knowledge articles from multiple cases with the Now Assist for HR Service Delivery \(HRSD\) application. Use generative AI to gather and create the content from multiple cases so that you can reduce the amount of time that you would have spent manually to get the same information.

## Before you begin

-   Install the following plugins:
    -   Knowledge Management Advanced plugin \[com.snc.knowledge\_advanced.installer\]; This is not a mandatory plugin and it cannot be uninstalled.
    -   Now Assist in Knowledge Management \[sn\_km\_gen\_ai\]
    -   Human Resources Scoped App: Core \[com.sn\_hr\_core\]
    -   Latest version of Agent Workspace for HR Case Management \[sn\_hr\_agent\_ws\]
    -   Human Resources Scoped App: Lifecycle Events \[com.sn\_hr\_lifecycle\_events\]
    -   Human Resources Scoped App: Employee Relations \[com.sn\_hr\_employee\_relations\]
-   Activate the Knowledge Assist skill from the Now Assist Admin console.

Role required:

-   sn\_hr\_core.case\_reader and sn\_hr\_core.kb\_writer roles to view the **Generate article** option on the HR Case \[sn\_hr\_core\_case\] and its extended tables.
-   sn\_hr\_le.case\_reader and sn\_hr\_core.kb\_writer roles to view the **Generate article** option on HR Lifecycle Events Cases.
-   sn\_hr\_er.case\_reader, sn\_hr\_core.kb\_writer roles to view the **Generate article** option on the employee relations cases.
-   You must have the required role for the knowledge base that you selected in the Now Assist Admin configuration.

**Note:** For Core UI users, in the **AI search indexed sources**, you must set the **Active** state to **true** for the HR Case \(source: HR Case sn\_hr\_core\_case\) table. The required roles to make this change are the **HR Admin** and **Agent** roles.

## About this task

You can use the KB generation skill in either Core UI or Agent Workspace. The fields that are used as inputs for generating knowledge articles are the Short description, description, close notes, work notes, and additional comments fields. You can also use up to five additional relevant tasks to help you create knowledge articles.

**Note:** The KB generation skill is supported in the Now Assist panel for the HR Case records \[sn\_hr\_core\_case\] table, but not on its extended table records.

You can make a copy of this skill to configure it to meet your business needs. For more information, see [Make a copy of a Now Assist skill](../../intelligent-experiences/make-a-copy-of-a-now-assist-skill.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **HR Agent Workspace**.

2.  Open an HR case that is assigned to you.

3.  Set the HR case to the **Close Complete** state.

4.  Select **Create knowledge**.

    **Note:** You can now select what type of article that you want to create.

5.  If displayed, select a **Knowledge base** and an **Article template** .

    **Note:**

    -   If your admin installed the Knowledge Management Advanced plugin \[com.snc.knowledge\_advanced.installer\] and enabled at least one article template, a modal is displayed so that you can select the knowledge base and article template. Otherwise, the article is created with the standard template.
    -   Disable the Use Now Assist to draft an article toggle if you don't want the AI to generate a knowledge article.
    -   Additional tasks that are relevant to your case can be used to draft your article. You can select up to five relevant tasks to help you create your article.
6.  Select **Create Article**.

7.  Select **Draft article** with **Now Assist**.

    **Note:** You see the message "We have found additional relevant tasks-select up to 5 to help in the creation of article." You also see a list of relevant tasks that you can select from.

8.  Select up to five tasks to help you create your article.

9.  If you don't need any other tasks to help you create your article, select **Continue without more tasks**.

10. **Note:** Now Assist starts to generate a draft of a an knowledge article and you see the "Drafting article" message box. After Now Assist finishes the draft and loading the article successfully, the article gets a unique ID number.

11. View, edit, or publish the article by using the UI actions on the screen.

    Now Assist has generated your article from multiple cases.
