# Use Floor Plan

Use the floor plan to manage space and user assignments in your workplace.

## Before you begin

Make sure that you have installed Workplace Core. For more information, see [Install Workplace Core](../workplace-core/install-workplace-service-delivery.md)

For the Floor plan, make sure that you have configured the map in Indoor Mapping. For more information about configuring an indoor map, see [Configure Indoor Mapping](../indoor-mapping/configure-ind-mapping.md).

Role required: sn\_wsd\_core.workplace\_manager

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workplace Central**.

2.  Select the **Space Planning** module.

    The Floor Plan tab opens by default.

3.  Select a campus, building, and floor to view the map.

4.  View the KPIs on the details panel.

    The following KPIs are displayed based on your selection on the map.

    -   `Space count`: Number of spaces on the floor or in the selection.
    -   `Total effective capacity`: Capacity of the number of spaces multiplied by their capacity ratio.

        For example: If 20 spaces have a capacity ratio of 1.5, and 10 spaces have a capacity ratio of 1, the space count is 30 and total effective capacity is 40.

    -   `Profiles assigned`: Number of workplace profiles assigned to the floor or selected spaces. If a user is assigned to multiple spaces, they are considered to have multiple profiles.

        For example, if a user is assigned to 2 spaces, and another user is assigned to 3 spaces, the number of assigned profiles is 5.

    -   `Unassigned spaces`: Number of spaces that do not have any assignments.
    -   `Assignment ratio`: Ratio of the assigned profiles to the total effective capacity.
5.  Select a **View by** option to group spaces on the map.

    The default view by option is set to **None**.

    Based on the view by option, the details panel displays information about Neighborhoods or Space Types. If the view by option is **None**, the details panel displays both Neighborhoods and Space Types.

6.  Perform any of the following actions based on your requirement.
