# Contract amendments

The contract amendment workflow enhances contract lifecycle management by enabling you to initiate, track, and finalize amendments to existing contracts with an audit trail.

Amendments can be made by adding, removing, or updating terms, without the need to replace the entire contract.

You can use the **Amendment request** intake form available in the Employee Center to submit an amendment request.

## Distinguish contract and amendment request

The field, **Request type**, differentiates contract and amendment requests. For amendment request, the value is **Amendment** and for contract request its **New contract**.

The Request type field is displayed in the contract details secondary header, and list pages making it easy to differentiate between the two request types.

This field is also available in the following base system configurations \(when demo data is installed\) to indicate whether the configuration applies to a contract or an amendment request:

-   Contract template rules
-   Contract configurations

## Types of paper for an amendment request

The amendment workflow supports both own-paper and third-party amendment requests.

**Note:** Third-party amendments are supported only for single contract types.

While submitting an amendment request, you can select the **Type of paper** from the intake form.

## Amendment intake form and record producer

The intake form and record producer for an amendment are available in the base system, enabling you to submit an amendment requests.

![Amendment intake from and record producer in the base sytem (OOB)](../image/lsd-amend-OOB-intakeform.png)

You can also create a customized record producer by copying a base system \(OOB\) record producer to reuse its existing configuration settings. For more information on how to create record producer, see [Create a legal contract intake workflow](snlc-create-legal-contract.md).

While linking the record producer to an intake form, verify that the **Amendment request indicator** is selected in the **Options** field.

The following other configurations are available in the base system when demo data is installed:

-   Contract template \(Sample - NDA Amendment-SignBlocks\) used to generate amendment document for own-paper based amendment request.
-   Contract template rule \(Sample - NDA Amendment-SignBlocks\) to identify the contract template used for generating a contract document for an amendment request.
-   Contract Configuration \(Sample - NDA Amendment-SignBlocks\) to define and map the fields that will be populated in the amendment document.

## View contract amendment details

The following tabs are available within the contract repository record to provide amendment details:

-   Contract Documents: Provides access to all documents related to the signed contracts, including those generated or updated as part of amendment processes.
-   Contract Requests: Displays all contract and amendment requests associated with the contract.
-   Amendment Field Changes: Shows a detailed log of all field changes made through amendments, enabling easy tracking of modifications over time.

## Contract amendment workflow

The contract amendment workflow might progress as follows:

1.  The contract requester does the following:
    1.  Initiates an amendment request from the Employee Center.
    2.  Selects a contract for amendment or enters contract details manually.

        **Note:** When a contract is selected while submitting an amendment request, it’s automatically linked as the parent contract for the amendment request.

    3.  Enters amendment details and submits the request.
2.  The contract fulfiller does the following:
    1.  Assign the amendment contract request.
    2.  Link a parent contract, if it’s already not linked.
    3.  Modify legal request.
    4.  Review the details of the amendment requested.
    5.  Update the contract details and contract document according to the amendment request.
    6.  Upload revised contract document using **Create revision** option.
    7.  Finalizes the contract amendment using the review, approval, and signature workflow.
3.  After all signatories have approved the document, the signed amendment is attached to the contract repository record.
4.  The contract repository record displays the amendment details in the Contract Documents, Contract Requests, and Amendment Field Changes tabs.
5.  The signed amendment is stored on the ServiceNow instance or an external storage system and referenced in the contract repository. The signed contract and its amendment documents are stored in a centralized repository under the parent contract for easy access and manage all related documents from a single location. The field values that have been modified is updated in the amendment according to the contract configuration mapping.
