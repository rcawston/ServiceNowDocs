# Domain separation and Legal Service Delivery

Domain separation is supported for applications in Legal Service Delivery. Domain separation enables you to separate data, processes, and administrative tasks into logical groupings called domains. You can control several aspects of this separation, including which users can see and access data.

## Support level: Basic



-   Business logic: Ensure that data goes into the proper domain for the application’s service provider use cases.
-   The application supports domain separation at run time. The domain separation includes separation from the user interface, cache keys, reporting, rollups, and aggregations.
-   The owner of the instance must set up the application to function across multiple tenants.

Sample use case: When a service provider \(SP\) uses chat to respond to a tenant-customer’s message, the customer must be able to see the SP's response.

For more information on support levels, see [Application support for domain separation](../../platform-security/domain-separated-apps.md).

## How domain separation works in Legal Service Delivery

-   If an employee submits a legal service request, the request can be assigned to legal department users who are in the same domain as the employee.
-   Lawyers or paralegal staff can work only on those legal requests that have been created within the domain that they belong to.
