# Workplace dashboard in Workplace Service Portal

Use the Workplace Dashboard from Workplace Service Portal to visually analyze the available workspace capacity, space request and reservation trends, and monitor the maintenance tasks of your workplace. You can also reserve a space for an employee or create a workplace maintenance task directly from this Workplace Service Portal page.

To open the Workplace dashboard on the Workplace Service Portal, navigate to **Workplace Core** &gt; **Dashboard**.

Selecting a region and site in the filter at the top displays reports for available campuses in separate tabs.

**Important:** For new customers, from Workplace Core \(sn\_wsd\_core\) version 2.2, the **Dashboard** is removed from the Workplace Service Portal and Service Portal. Customers using Workplace Core version 2.1 and below can still access the dashboard after an upgrade.
