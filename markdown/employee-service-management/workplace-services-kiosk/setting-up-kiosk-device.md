# Setting up a kiosk device

Set up a kiosk device by assigning a kiosk to a physical device.

To enable usage of a kiosk device, you must select a kiosk for the device. The kiosk module displays the pages configured by an admin and visitors can use the device to check in and self-register. For more information about configuring kiosk devices, see [Create a kiosk configuration](create-kiosk-device-config.md).

You can access the kiosk page by using the following URL: `https://<instance name>.service-now.com/kiosk`

## Select a kiosk for a device

Select a kiosk for the device to render the configuration pages created by the kiosk admin.

### Before you begin

Role required: sn\_wsd\_kiosk.operator

### Procedure

1.  On a kiosk device, login using your operator credentials.

2.  On the Kiosk setup page, select **Select Kiosk**.

4.  Provide camera permissions for the kiosk.

    1.  On the Allow camera access page, select **Continue**.

    2.  On your browser prompt, select the option to always allow camera access to the website.

        **Note:** If you are using the Apple Safari browser, you must allow the website to always access the camera from your browser settings.

        Security features of Google Chrome on iOS don't allow permanent camera access to websites, therefore, camera-related functions of the kiosk are disabled.

    3.  After the camera access is granted, select **Save Kiosk**.

    If you have existing kiosks that do not have camera permissions, you will receive a notification to update the kiosks and allow camera access.
