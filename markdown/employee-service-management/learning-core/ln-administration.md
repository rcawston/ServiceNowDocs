# Administration tasks in Learning Core

Complete the administrative tasks in Learning Core with the Learning admin \[learning\_admin\] role.

## Before you begin

Role required: learning\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Create source records for learning management systems that are integrating with Learning Core.

    For more information, see [Create a source for a learning system](set-up-int-lc.md).

    **Important:** Once you set up the Learning Core application, the source record for Cornerstone OnDemand, Pluralsight, Udemy, Sumtotal , and Saba applications are automatically created in the Source module in Enterprise Service Management Integrations Framework. These source records contain a predefined set of properties and integration services that help in pulling learning courses from Cornerstone On Demand, Pluralsight, Udemy, Sumtotal, and Saba applications into your ServiceNow instance.

2.  Configure properties for various settings used in Learning Core.

    For more information, see [Configure properties for Learning Core](config-ln-prop.md).

3.  View the consolidated report on courses in each source, the number of catalogs associated with each of the source, and the status of learning tasks by source.

    For more information, see [Reporting Solutions for Learning Core](learning-exp-db.md).
