# Add a contractor company from Health and Safety Workspace

Add a contractor company to prequalify it and its workers. You can then manage the contractor workers from this company for their health and safety.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hs\_crm.contractor\_coordinator

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Health and Safety** &gt; **Health and Safety Workspace**.

2.  Select the contractor management icon \(![Contractor management icon](../image/icon-contractor-mgmt.png)\) to open the **Contractor Management** tab.

3.  In the **Lists** tab, select **Contractor companies** and then **All**.

4.  Select **New** to add a contractor company for health and safety.

5.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    1.  Enter company details such as Company name, Services provided, Industry type, address, and its star rating.

    2.  Add a primary contact from the contractor company in the **Primary contact** field.

        The **Primary contact** field displays only users who have been assigned the \[snc\_external\] role and have the Health and Safety profile created for them.

        For more information, see [Assign Health and Safety profile to a contractor worker](hs-assign-hs-user-profile-contract-worker.md).

7.  Select **Save**.


## Result

## What to do next

-   In the **Workers** tab, select **Add** to add contract workers from this company who will perform required tasks at your site. Add all the contractor workers including their areas of expertise and contact details.

    **Note:** Only users who have been assigned the \[snc\_external\] role and have the Health and Safety profile created for them appear in the list and can be added as contract workers.
