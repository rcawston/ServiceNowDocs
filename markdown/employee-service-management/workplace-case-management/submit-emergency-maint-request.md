    |Floor|Floor where the maintenance is to be carried out.|
    |Space|Workspace which needs maintenance.|
    |Describe the issue|Short description of the maintenance case.|

    A workplace case is created and it is assigned automatically to the Workplace Event Planners assignment group.

    When the emergency maintenance request case is assigned to a orkplace Event Planners assignment group, the AI agentic workflow **Manage temporary space closures** is triggered. The team of AI agents block a workspace location for maintenance. AI agents create a record in the sn\_wsd\_core\_block\_location table for blocking a location. If there are any impacted reservations for a blocked location, AI agents move any existing reservations to a new location.For more information, see [Manage temporary space closures agentic workflow](../now-assist-for-wsd/maintenance-meeting-room-agent-ai.md).
