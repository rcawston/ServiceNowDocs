# Work with Location Directory for Now Mobile app

Work with Map view and Card view on the Location directory. Search for employees, locations, and neighborhoods. Filter spaces based on reservation status, occupancy status, and space types. Get directions to a workplace location or collaborators or a workplace profile user using floor maps. Reserve a space or raise a workplace service request or an issue for a location.

## Before you begin

Make sure that the following applications are configured:

-   Workplace Core
-   Indoor Mapping
-   Workplace Reservation Management \(Optional\)

    Filter and display reservation status for a selected location on the Location directory.

-   Workplace Connectors \(Optional\)

    Filter and display occupancy status for a selected location on the Location directory.

-   Workplace Space Mapping

**Note:** Confirm that the map properties for the Location directory are configured by your administrator. Map properties for the Location directory provide options to:

-   Filter spaces based on the reservation and occupancy states.
-   Automatically refresh reservation and occupancy data on the Location directory.
-   Control the Map display setting options to display permanent and private workplace profile users.
-   Show or hide neighborhoods for a location.

For more information, see [Configure map properties for Location directory](wsd-mobile-map-config-properties-loc-directory.md)

Role required: sn\_wsd\_core.workplace\_user \(workplace\_user\)

## Procedure

1.  Log in to the Now Mobile app and select the add \(+\) option on the home page.

    ![Workplace Service Delivery Mobile Home Screen](../images/wsd-mobile-homepage.png)

2.  Tap to select **View Location directory**.

    ![Option to select and open the View Location directory on Now Mobile app.](../images/wsd-mob-showing-view-location-directory-button.png)

    By default, the Map view is displayed. The Location directory home page is displayed on the World map.

    **Note:** If a location doesn’t have indoor Maps, the Location directory opens in the Card view.

3.  Tap to select the **Select Campus** tab.

    ![Now Mobile showing the option to select a campus on the Location Directory home page.](../images/wsd-mobile-location-directory-homepage.png)

    You can also search for a campus or zoom in to select a campus or location.

    1.  On the search bar, search for a campus or location.

    2.  Use the zoom in \(![Zoom in control icon to focus on the map artifacts.](../images/wsd-mobile-zoom-in-icon-new-loc-directory.jpeg)\) controls on the map to bring into focus the location pin marker icon \(![Location pin marker on map.](../images/wsd-location-pin-icon.png)\) to select a campus.

    3.  Employees can also pinch to zoom in the location.

        You can also swipe your mobile screen and move around the map to select a location.

4.  When you select a campus, the **Select Building** tab is enabled and the buildings in a campus are displayed.

    For example, Demo campus with Building A and Building B.

    ![Location Directory campus showing buildings in a campus on Now Mobile.](../images/wsd-mobile-new-loc-directory-home-page.png)

5.  Tap on the **Select Building** tab and select a building.

    When you select a building, the **Select Floor** and the **Filters** menu options are enabled.

    **Note:** The **Last updated &lt;time interval&gt;** label is shown on the map after selecting a building. For example, **Last updated 1 min ago**. The map is automatically refreshed if your administrator has enabled the map property \(**Auto Refresh time interval \(in mins\) for showing Reservation and/or Occupancy information on the Location directory**\). This property fetches the latest reservation and occupancy data on the map.

    ![Last updated time interval label to show the time when the latest occupancy and reservation data is fetched.](../images/wsd-mobile-last-updated-time-new-loc-directory.jpeg)

6.  Tap **Select Floor** to select a floor.

    You can also search and select floor from the list.

    ![Search for a floor from the Floor list option.](../images/wsd-mobile-new-search-floors-loc-dir.png)

7.  Select **Filters**.

    Filter spaces or locations on the map by reservation states, occupancy states, and space types \(rooms, gym, elevator, and so on\).

    ![Filter space availability by reservation status and occupancy status.](../images/wsd-mobile-filters-new-rsv-occ-status-loc-dir.png)

    Spaces are filtered and the ones that match the filter conditions are displayed on the map. Spaces that don’t fulfill the filter conditions or that don’t have a filter applied are shown in white \(map polygon color\).

    -   When both reservation and occupancy filters are applied then spaces fulfilling both these conditions are shown.
    -   When only reservation or occupancy filters are applied then only reservation or occupancy states are displayed.
    **Note:** The option to show **Filters** option is configured by your administrator using a map property \[sn\_wsd\_space\_map.show\_rsv\_occ\_data\_loc\_dir\]. Filters can be applied at a floor or space level for both Card view and Map view.

    1.  Tap to select the **Reservation status** check box to display reservation status and icons on the map.

        For more information about Legends, see Step 12.

    2.  Select and filter spaces based on reservation states.

        For example, you can select any of the following reservation states to display only the selected filter conditions on the map:

        -   Booked
        -   Available
        -   Not Reservable
        -   Currently booked
    1.  Tap to select the **Occupancy status** check box.

        ![Filter space availability by occupancy status or spaces.](../images/wsd-mobile-filters-occupancy-spaces-new-loc-dir.png)

        Occupancy status and related icons are displayed on the map. For more information about Legends, see Step 12.

    2.  Filter spaces by occupancy states.

        For example, select any of the following occupancy states to display on the map:

        -   Occupied
        -   Not Occupied
        -   Sensor not installed
        -   Sensor not working
    -   Tap to select **Spaces** &gt; **Show all space types**.
    -   Filter selected space types on the map. For example, the following space types can be selected:

        -   Rooms
        -   Gym
        -   Cafe
        -   Phone booth
        -   Workspace/Desk
        -   Restroom-Men
        -   Restroom-Women
        -   Miscellaneous
        -   Elevator
        **Note:** Indoor Mapping places types are shown as Spaces types on the Location directory.

    -   Select **Apply** to apply your changes on the map.
    -   Tap and select **Clear** to remove filters.

    Space card details show labels or tags for space occupancy and reservation states. For example, **Available**, **currently booked**, or **Sensor not working**.

    1.  Select **Reserve** to reserve an available space.

        For example, tags for reservation and occupancy status are shown in the space card details panel \(**Available \| Sensor not working**\).

    2.  Select **Get Directions** for wayfinding.

        This option enables employees to navigate to a meeting room or to a co-worker's desk and collaborate effectively.

        You can find directions from a selected space to another space in the same building or to another building or to a different floor in another building.

    1.  Tap and enter the starting route for wayfinding in the **Select start point**.

        You can enter a workplace profile name, location, desk, or meeting room.

    2.  Tap and enter the destination for the wayfinding route in **Select End Point**.

        The location is selected by default. You can change it as required to another building, space, or to a workplace profile.

        Accessible routes or pathways are near or adjacent to an elevator.

        The directions are displayed on the map. You can define directions from one building or floor to another building or floor. For example, get directions from Building A to Building B.

        ![Get directions from one building to another.](../images/wsd-get-directions-new-loc-dir-wayfinding-buildings.png)

        ![Get directions to a workplace user or collaborator.](../images/wsd-get-directions-collaborator-new-loc-dir.jpeg)

        If you try to provide a route or location that is not configured by your administrator, an error message is shown `Sorry! This location is not configured to be shown on the map`.

        ![Location directory Get directions pathways showing error for locations that are not configured.](../images/wsd-mobile-get-directions-error-use-new-loc-directory.png)
