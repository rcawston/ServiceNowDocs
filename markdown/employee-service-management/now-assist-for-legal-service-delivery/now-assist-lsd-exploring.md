This summary captures key details and the actions taken throughout the lifecycle of the request or matter. Request fulfillers can review the summary to quickly understand context, refresh it as needed, and post it to work notes for reference and collaboration.

The summary is displayed above the activity stream and includes the information from the fields and variablesconfigured as inputs.![Legal matter summarization](../image/lsd-sum-matter-landing.png)

## Conversational intake

Conversational Intake guides legal users through submitting Conflict of Interest \(COI\) requests using a chat‑based experience from the Now Assist in Virtual Agent interface of Employee Center

Instead of completing static forms, legal users can describe the COI details in natural language. Details provided in conversational language are automatically populated into the intake form, reducing the effort required to fill in form fields. The system asks relevant follow‑up questions based on the request type, and validates responses to ensure that all required details are captured accurately.

After submission, the system evaluates the COI request to determine risk. Low‑risk requests are auto‑approved, while medium‑ and high‑risk requests are routed for approval.

For more information on COI application and the risk assessment, see [Legal Conflict of Interest](../legal-conflict-of-interest/legal-conflict-of-interest-landing-page.md) and [Exploring Legal Conflict of Interest](../legal-conflict-of-interest/conflict-of-interest-overview.md).

You can use Now LLM Service, Now LLM Long Term Stable models \(LTS\), Azure OpenAI, Google Gemini or Anthropic Claude on AWS as the AI model provider for all Now Assist skills and AI agents. Use the Configuration Controls in [AI Control Tower](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/ai-control-tower/ai-model-providers.md) to define which options are available, then set the skill-level preferences in the [Now Assist Admin console](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/manage-large-language-models.md).
