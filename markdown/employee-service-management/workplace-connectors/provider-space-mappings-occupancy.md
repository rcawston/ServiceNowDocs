# Configure Provider Space Mapping for occupancy data

The Provider Space Mapping data table stores the workplace locations and external Ids provided by the occupancy data provider.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workplace Connectors** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Provider Space Mapping**.

    The location data is mapped with the external Ids of the provider. For example, Metrikus occupancy data using the External Ids. The location hierarchy is shown for the spaces or locations that you selected in the [Provider Connector Configuration](provider-connector-config-occupancy.md) table.

<table id="table_qsm_r3s_s1c"><thead><tr><th>

Workplace locations mapped with Occupancy data provider. The location data shows the complete location hierarchy \(Region, site, campus, buildings, floors, and spaces\)

</td></tr><tr><td>

Option to enter manually the external id provided by the Metrikus spoke or any other occupancy spoke data provider. Select and select a row in the External id column, enter the Metrikus Id or spoke provider Id and select the tick mark icon \(![check-mark-icon to save an entry](../images/green-check-mark-icon.png)\) to save it. External Ids are corresponding space Ids or location ids on the provider side. External ids from the Provider \(for example, Metrikus\) are mapped with the space records in Workplace Connectors

.The external Id data is transformed to a corresponding Workplace Connectors space Id in the Metrikus Spoke data converter extension point. The data is then mapped to a space id in Workplace Connectors.
