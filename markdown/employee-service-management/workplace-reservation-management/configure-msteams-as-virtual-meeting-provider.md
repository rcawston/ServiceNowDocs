# Configure Microsoft Teams as virtual meeting provider

Set Microsoft Teams as your virtual meeting provider.

## Before you begin

-   Ensure the following:
    -   Update the Workplace Reservation Management application only after installing the Microsoft Teams spoke. Otherwise, you must repair the Workplace Reservation Management application.
    -   Microsoft Teams works only with a Microsoft account \(Exchange Online, Exchange OnPrem\). If you have both Google and a Microsoft Teams account, the virtual meeting provider cannot be added. If you want to create a Microsoft Teams account, you must create a Microsoft account. The Microsoft Teams account is mapped to the Microsoft account and not to the Google account.
    -   For Microsoft Teams, to create a meeting link on behalf of other users, refer to [Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/cloud-communication-online-meeting-application-access-policy/).

The Workplace Reservation Management application provides the **Template** virtual meeting provider by default. After you setup a connection between Workplace Reservation Management and Microsoft Teams, the system, by default, provides the **Microsoft Teams** virtual meeting provider configured with the following flows:

|Field|Flow|
|-----|----|
|Create meeting|`Create Microsoft Teams Meeting`|
|Get meeting details|`Get MS Teams Thread ID`|
|Get recording|`Get Microsoft Teams Recording`|

For more information on how to create a flow, refer to [Create a flow](../../build-workflows/workflow-studio/create-flow.md).

**Important:** The virtual meeting providers are deactivated by default. Change the **Active** status of the desired virtual meeting provider to **true** to start using.

Role required: sn\_wsd\_rsv.admin

## Procedure

1.  Connect Workplace Reservation Management and Microsoft Teams.

    To create a connections, refer to [Connect Workplace Reservation Management with Microsoft Teams](connect-rsv-mgmt-with-teams.md).

    After the connection is configured, the application by default provides with the **Microsoft Teams** virtual meeting provider.

2.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workplace Reservation Management** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Virtual Meeting Providers**.

3.  Select **Microsoft Teams**.

4.  On the form, to activate, select the **Active** check box.
