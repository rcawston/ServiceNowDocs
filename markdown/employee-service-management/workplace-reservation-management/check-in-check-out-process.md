# Manage check-in and check-out reservations

Reservation check in and check- out reminders are managed through the Check-in and check out reminder scheduled jobs

The following properties are being used in this scheduled job:

-   sn\_wsd\_rsv.time\_before\_check\_in\_out\_reminder
-   sn\_wsd\_rsv.time\_when\_reservation\_cancelled\_without\_check\_in

Ensure check-in is required on the Reservable module at the space level. For more information, see [Configure a reservable module](config-reservable-module.md).

-   This can be enforced through the Reservable Module property value **Override check-in policy**” on the Reservable Module to **always require check-in**
-   This can be managed at the space level. Space is indicated as check-in required. Set **Override check-in policy** on the Reservable Module to **no override**.
-   On the Reservation summary page, the check-in state should be set to **awaiting\_check\_in**.
-   Reservations are only cancelled when the **Cancel reservations exceeding check-in time** check box is selected on the Reservable Module
-   The check-in and check-out schedule job runs every 30 minutes by default. It takes into account all the workplace reservations that require check-in or check-out, and validates the next action.

</table>    **Note:**

    -   Takes about 30 minutes \(based on the default configuration\) to receive an email notification for an employee who has not checked in the reservation.
    -   Takes about 60 minutes \(based on the default configuration\) for the reservation to be cancelled in case the employee did not check-in the reservation.
    The daily scheduled job **Reservation daily tasks** closes all reservations at the end of the office working hours. Reservation may be closed the day after. The check-in state for reservations that are checked-in is indicated as **no\_check\_out**.
