# Create a workplace service to provide an extra service for a reservation

Create a workplace service and provide it as an extra service to employees while making a reservation. Use the Workplace Case Management application to create the workplace service.

## Before you begin

Ensure that you have the following:

-   Have the Workplace Case Management application installed.
-   Task templates and Case templates to link to the workplace service.
-   Record producer to link to the workplace service.
-   Active flows in case you want to create a workplace service flow.

Role required: sn\_wsd\_case.admin or sn\_wsd\_case.manager

## About this task

To understand workplace services and the workplace service-related options, refer to [Workplace Services](../workplace-case-management/workplace-services.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workplace Case Management** &gt; **Workplace Case Management - Setup** &gt; **Workplace services**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    For a description of the field values, see [Workplace Service form](../workplace-case-management/workplace-service-form.md).

4.  Click **Submit**.


## Result

The workplace service is created and will be available to employees as an extra service.

When an employee requests an extra service, a workplace case is created in the Workplace Case Management application. If the extra service is modified by the employee, then the existing workplace case is canceled and a new workplace case is again created with the modified details.

## What to do next

-   If the extra service requires an employee to select from a list of options, then you must add those options as workplace service items to the workplace service. To add workplace service items, refer to the following:
    -   [Add a workplace service item to a workplace service](../workplace-case-management/add-workplace-service-items.md).
    -   [Make a workplace service item available to a workplace location](../workplace-case-management/add-workplace-service-item-to-workplace-locs.md).
-   To view the workplace cases, navigate to **Workplace Case Management** &gt; **Workplace Cases**.
-   You can also view the reservation details of a Workplace case. To view the details, perform the following actions:
    1.  Right-click the form header.
    2.  Select **View** &gt; **Reservation View**.

        In the **Reservation view**, you can view details such as the reservation and comments added by the employee while requesting an extra service.

-   You can also view the extra service cases and tasks in the Workplace Reservation Management application.
    -   To view the cases, navigate to **Workplace Reservation Management** &gt; **Reservation Overview** &gt; **Extra Service Cases**.
    -   To view the tasks created for the cases, navigate to **Workplace Reservation Management** &gt; **Reservation Overview** &gt; **Extra Service Tasks**.
