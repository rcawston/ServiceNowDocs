# AI Search in mobile

The AI Search search engine in the Now Mobile platform enables users to find answers to issues and then proceed quickly with their tasks.

The mobile platform supports two search engines within applet launchers: AI Search and Zing.

AI Search uses user data sources \(people\), catalog items \(services\), and knowledge articles. The Zing search engine uses additional data sources not associated with AI Search, for example, user tasks and requests.

-   For more information on AI Search configuration, see [AI Search](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/ai-search/overview-ais.md).
-   For more information about Zing configuration, see [Global search for mobile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/mobile-search-config.md).

**Note:** You cannot simultaneously use both AI Search and Zing search engines within the same search field. However, you can configure individual applet launchers to host a different search engine per applet. For more information, see [Add AI Search to a launcher screen](aisearch-add-applet-launcher.md).

AI Search offers the following features:

-   Navigation tab filters - Filters help users narrow down results on a site.
-   Auto-complete - As the user enters text, AI Search predicts the query and helps formulate the user's question.
-   Recent and popular searches - When the user starts to search, two categories of search answers display: the user's personal search history and the most common queries by all users on the instance.
-   Auto-correct typos - Typos are auto-corrected based on indexed content. 
-   Synonym handling - The search engine also looks for words similar to the search term.
-   Genius cards and action items - Genius result cards display the most relevant answers and offer users the option to perform actions within the card, for example, adding buttons to make a call, send an email, or add to a shopping basket.
