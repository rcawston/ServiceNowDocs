# Review AI-extracted metadata and contract reminder date

Use the contract playbook to review and update the AI-extracted metadata and contract reminder date.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cm\_gen\_ai.ai\_contract\_fulfiller

## About this task

The Manage contract repository agentic workflow uses AI agents to extract key metadata from signed contracts and calculate contract reminder date. The metadata is extracted based on the applicable use case in the Contract metadata extraction skill. After the extraction process is complete, a message appears on the contract record and an email notification is sent with a link to review the extracted metadata. Once you have reviewed and submitted the extracted metadata, the contract reminder date is calculated based on the contract end date, auto-renewal clause, and notice period for contract renewal or termination.

To receive notifications when AI agents complete metadata extraction, ensure that notifications are enabled by the system administrator. For more information, see [Enable notifications for AI extracted metadata and obligations](cmpro-na-me-agentic-ntf.md).

## Procedure

1.  Open a contract repository record where you want to review the extract information.
