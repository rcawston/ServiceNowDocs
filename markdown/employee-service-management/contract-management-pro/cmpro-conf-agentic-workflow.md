# Configuring agentic workflows in Now Assist in Contract Management

Configure agentic workflows in Now Assist in Contract Management so that contract fulfillers can use the AI agents to perform specific tasks autonomously.

Complete the following steps to configure agentic workflows in Contract Management Pro.

1.  Install the Contract Management Pro - Prime plugin \(sn\_cm\_ai\_prime\).

    For information about the plugin installation process, see [Install Now Assist plugins](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/install-now-assist-feature-plugins.md).

2.  Ensure Now Assist panel is turned on. For more information, see [Activate the Now Assist panel standard chat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/activate-now-assist-panel.md).
3.  Ensure **Now Assist Panel - Platform \(default\)** assistant in the CI Admin Experience is turned on. For more information, see [Manage LLM virtual agents on the Assistants screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/manage-llm-va.md).
4.  Configure the security controls to specify the users who can discover or use the agentic workflow, and provide data permissions for the agentic workflow.

    For more information, see [Configuring user access and data permissions for agentic workflows](cmpro-conf-users-agentic-wf.md).

5.  Configure the security controls to specify the users who can discover or use the agentic workflow, and provide data permissions for AI agents.

    For more information, see [Configuring user access and data permissions for AI agents](cmpro-conf-users-ai-agents.md).

6.  Ensure that Contract metadata extraction and Contract obligation extraction skills are configured and activated in Now Assist Admin console.

    For more information, see [Configuring contract metadata extraction](cncore-conf-metadata-extraction.md) and [Configuring contract obligation extraction](cncore-conf-obligation-extraction.md).

7.  Activate business rules for the agentic workflow to run the AI agents autonomously. For more information, see [Activate business rules for the Manage contract repository agentic workflow](conf-repository-agentic-ai.md).
8.  If you want to modify an agentic workflow, duplicate it and then update it.

9.  If you have customized the Manage contract repository agentic workflow, update the script include to run it autonomously.

    For more information, see [Update the contracts AI agents handler script include](cmpro-script-includ-agenticAI.md).

10. Configure system properties to set the notice period for the Manage contract repository agentic workflow that will be used when the contract renewal notice period and termination of contract renewal notice period are not available in a contract.

    For more information, see [Set the default notice period for the Manage contract repository agentic workflow](conf-sys-prop-default-np.md).

11. Enable the email notification for contract metadata and obligation extraction to notify users when metadata extraction is completed.

    For more information, see [Enable notifications for AI extracted metadata and obligations](cmpro-na-me-agentic-ntf.md).
