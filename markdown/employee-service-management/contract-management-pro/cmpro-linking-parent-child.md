# Linking parent-child contracts

Link a parent contract to a child contract to establish hierarchical relationships between contract requests and inherit fields from the parent contract request.

You can associate a contract request with a parent contract from the Related Contract Request tab. When linked, the **Parent contract** field in the contract request Details tab is automatically populated with the parent contract request number. Depending on configuration, child contracts can inherit fields from the parent contract. Additionally, the associated contract repository records for the parent and child contract requests are automatically linked.

To link a contract as a parent, the following conditions must be met:

-   The user must be assigned to the contract request, be a group manager, or a collaborator.
-   The contract request must be in one of the following states: Draft, Work in progress, Awaiting review, or Contract signed.

    **Note:** If the contract request is in Contract signed state, the parent contract request must be in Contract signed or Closed complete state.

-   The parent contract must not be in a Canceled state.
-   Only one parent contract can be selected while linking.
-   The parent contract must be a single contract type using own paper or third-party paper.
