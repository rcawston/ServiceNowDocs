# Assign a role for configuring template mappings

Enable a contract user to configure information placed in the contract document by assigning a contract configurator role.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

Template mappings automatically insert default information in the contract document. To configure template mappings, the contract user requires a contracts configurator \(sn\_cm\_core.contract\_config\) role.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **User Administration** &gt; **Users**.

2.  Search for and select the user.

3.  In the Roles related list, select **Edit**.

4.  Move the sn\_cm\_core.contract\_config role from the Available list to the Selected list.

    ![Add sn_cm_core.contract_config to the user](../image/cmpro-bu-add-config-role.png "Add sn_cm_core.contract_config role to user")

5.  Select **Save**.

6.  Save the user record by selecting **Update**.


## Result

The user who with the sn\_cm\_core.contract\_config role can update template mappings to pre-fill information that's placed in the contract document. For more information, [Update contract template mappings](cncore-template-mapping.md).
