# Add content controls in a Microsoft Word document

As a contract configurator, prepare a Microsoft Word document that you want to import as a contract template by marking the content with content controls so it can be efficiently parsed and reused.

## Before you begin

Ensure that you are on a Windows system to add content controls in a Microsoft Word document.

Role required: sn\_cm\_core.contract\_config

## Procedure

1.  In Microsoft Word, open the document that you want to import as a contract template.

2.  On the Microsoft Word Home ribbon, select the Show/Hide formatting marks icon \(![Show/Hide formatting marks icon](../image/lsd-word-formatting-icon.png)\) to see the formatting symbols.

3.  Display the **Developer** tab in Microsoft Word.

    For more information, see the [Show the Developer tab](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/show-the-developer-tab-e1192344-5e56-4d45-931b-e5fd9bea2d45) topic in the Microsoft Office 365 documentation.

4.  Select the content to be tagged.

5.  Select **Plain Text Content Control** from the **Developer** tab.

6.  Select the **Properties** option from the **Developer** tab.

7.  In the **Content Control Properties** dialog box, enter a title for the content control.

8.  Enter a tag value.

    **Note:**

    -   The tag names are not case sensitive. If there are two tag names as clause\_PURPOSE and clause\_purpose, both will be treated same.
    -   The maximum character limit for the tag is 200.
    -   When inserting content controls for signatures or signatories, ensure the font color of the tagged text matches the document’s background color.
    Tag names contain a prefix with the content control type.

    |Content control type|Description|
    |--------------------|-----------|
    |field\_|Indicates metadata.|
    |clause\_|Indicates a clause.|
    |signature\_|Indicates a signature.|
    |sign\_date\_|Indicates the signing date.|
    |signatory\_name|Indicates the name of the signatory.|
    |signatory\_email|Indicates the email of the signatory.|
    |signatory\_title|Indicates the title of the signatory.|

9.  Select **OK**.
