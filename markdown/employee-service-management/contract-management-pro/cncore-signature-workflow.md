# Signature workflow for a contract request

Contract Management Pro supports electronic signature or wet \(manual\) signature for a contract request.

-   Electronic Signature: Enables signatories to sign the contract document electronically. For more information, see [Configure an e-signature provider](cncore-integrate-esign.md).

    If you want to generate a certificate of completion, you must select the **Electronic Signature** as signature type in the contract request. For more information, see [Activate a system property to generate a certificate of completion](cncore-config-system-prop-COC.md).

-   Wet Signature: Enables signatories to sign the contract document manually. You can then upload the signed document to a contract request. For more information, see [Upload a manually signed contract document](cncore-upload-doc-wsignature.md).

## Electronic signature workflow

-   Send the finalized document to the signatories for signing.
    -   The state and contract status updates to Awaiting Signature and the electronic signature flow is triggered as configured in [Configure an e-signature provider](cncore-integrate-esign.md).
    -   An email notification that the contract document is available for signature is sent to the first signatory. The email contains a link to the contract document that the signatory can open and sign the document through the Docusign or Adobe Acrobat Sign electronic signature provider.

        The signatories will receive signature request email according to the order set in the signatories tab.

    -   The signatory fields—such as Name, Title, and Email—are not pre-filled in the contract document before it is sent for signature. These fields will be populated by the electronic signature provider when the signatory access the document to sign it.
-   Signatories can sign or decline the contract document.

## Modify signatories when the signature workflow is in progress

Modify Signatories options enables you to add, remove, edit, or reorder pending signatories  while a signature workflow is in progress. Initiating this action pauses the signature workflow  for a duration defined by the system property  **maximum\_signature\_pause\_duration**. To continue the signature workflow after making changes, use the  **Resume Signature ** option to resume the workflow.

The workflow might progress as follows:

-   Use **Modify signatories** option to modify the signatories.
-   Add, remove, modify, or reorder signatories.

    **Note:**

    -   For signature block-based contract templates, you can add, modify, remove, and reorder actions, whereas for participant based templates, only modify and reorder actions are enabled.
    -   Modify signatories option is available in wet signature workflow and Electronic signature workflow with Docusign electronic signature provider integration.
-   Select **Resume signature** to resume the signature workflow once modifications are complete.

    **Note:** If the signature workflow is not resumed within the configured time duration, any changes made to the signatories are reverted, and the signature workflow resumes from its previous state.

-   Signature request email notifications are sent to the signatories.
-   After the last signatory has signed the document, the contract repository record is created and the signed document is attached to it.

For more information, see [Modify signatories](cncore-pause-signature.md) and [Resend signature request](cncore-resend-sign-req.md).

## Contract document access

Access to a contract document is based on the following user roles and conditions:

-   A contract fulfiller can view and update contract documents
-   Only a contract administrator can delete contract documents.
-   Requesters can view only the contract documents for which they submitted the contract request.
-   Users added to the watch list can view only contract documents for contract requests they have added.

While generating the contract repository record, mapped fields and their values are validated for data type and correctness. If validation errors are found, an email notification is sent to the contract fulfiller. The email also displays the list of fields that haven’t been copied into the final contract document and the link to the contract repository record. The fulfiller then opens the record using the link and corrects the values to resolve the validation errors.

-   **[Upload a manually signed contract document](cncore-upload-doc-wsignature.md)**

Modify signatories while a signature workflow is in progress.
-   **[Resend signature request](cncore-resend-sign-req.md)**
