# Review move conflicts

You can review the reason behind a move request conflict and decide how to resolve the conflict.

If the state of a move request is set to Closed incomplete, it means that the move request couldn’t be completed due to various reasons. As a move manager, you can review if there are any conflicts with the move request in the Conflicts review related list.

The different types of conflicts are as follows:

-   **Selected destination location is not active**: Conflict due to inactive to location selected to move.
-   **Selected destination location is already occupied**: Conflict due to unavailability of the location selected to move.
-   **The cost centre/department of user and the selected destination location does not match**: Conflict due to mismatch in the user's cost centre/department and the location selected to move. The conflict is considered based on the Allocation type \[**sn\_wsd\_core.ALLOCATION\_TYPE**\] system property
-   **The selected destination location is a flexible location**: Conflict due to the location that is selected to move is a flexible location.
-   **Created a workplace move request for a space that is a workplace profile of another user**

You can also customize the list of validations that you want to run on a move request. You can add validations or change existing validations in the **WSDMoveRequestValidations** script include.
