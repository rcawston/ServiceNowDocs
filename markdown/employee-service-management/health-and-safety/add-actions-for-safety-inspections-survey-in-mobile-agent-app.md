# Add actions for safety inspections survey in Mobile Agent app

Learn how to use the Mobile Agent app to create actions for an inspection survey in online or offline mode.

## Before you begin

Verify the following conditions:

-   The system properties for the offline mode behavior of the mobile application are configured. For more information, see [Configure offline mode behavior](../../mobile/sg-configure-offline-mode.md).
-   The offline mode for the Mobile Agent app on your mobile device is turned on. For more information, see [Offline mode for Mobile Agent](hs-health-safety-mobile.md#section_hs_mobile_offline_mode).
-   The **glide.sg.offline.scheduled\_download.enabled** system property for scheduled offline caching is set. If the property is not set, manually update cache before you go offline. To update cache, navigate to **Settings** and tap **Update Cache**. This ensures that the survey is downloaded and it's ready for you to complete.

Role required: sn\_hs\_rm.safety\_inspection\_agent
