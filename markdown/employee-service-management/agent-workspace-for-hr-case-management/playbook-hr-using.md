# Using HR Service Delivery Playbook

Currently, HR Service Delivery Playbook is only available for use with lifecycle event HR cases.

Playbook shows as a tab on the HR Agent Workspace form after displaying an LE case.

**Note:** The Playbook tab only appears after the HR case has moved to **Ready** or **Work in Progress**. This triggers the lifecycle event and data appears for all launched activities.

![HR Service Delivery Playbook](../image/playbook-hr-playbook-tab.png)

Selecting the Playbook tab allows you to view and work all lifecycle event activities and their child tasks in a single pane.

**Note:** Tasks that are created ad-hoc and not part of the workflow do not appear in the tab, but may be accessible in regular related lists.

-   **Lifecycle event**

    The title of the lifecycle event is at the top below the **Playbook** tab in the stage panel.

-   **Activity sets**

    The list of lanes along with their status icon appear below the lifecycle event description.![HR Agent WS - Stage panel](../image/playbook-hr-le-column.png)

    Under the New Hire Onboarding \(Demo\) lifecycle event are five \(5\) activity sets:

    -   Start onboarding
    -   Prepare for day 1
    -   Start your new job!
    -   Ramp up
    -   Initial check-in
-   **Activities**

    Click on an activity set to view the associated activities.
