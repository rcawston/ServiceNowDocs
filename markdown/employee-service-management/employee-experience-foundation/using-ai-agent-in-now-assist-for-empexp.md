</table>## System properties

To display the AI agent output to users in the Now Assist in Virtual Agent conversations, you must set the system property **sn\_aia.enable\_va\_conversation** value to **true**. By default, the property is set to **false**.

The properties are listed in the System Properties \[sys\_properties\] table. To access the table, enter `sys_properties.list` in the navigation context-menu filter.

Set this property to **true** to display the AI agent output to users while using the Now Assist in Virtual agent in the Employee Center.-   Type: true/false
-   Default value: False

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>**Important:** All use case and AI agent records are read only by default.

To run the AI agents autonomously, you must first duplicate the use case, and then do the following steps:

-   Activate the use case.
-   Activate all agents within the use case.
-   Activate the trigger to invoke the use case automatically. If you prefer to invoke it manually, activating the trigger isn't necessary.

There might be AI agents installed with the Now Assist application that are not used in agentic workflows. To learn how to see all agents that are available to you, see [Find AI agents](../../intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md).
