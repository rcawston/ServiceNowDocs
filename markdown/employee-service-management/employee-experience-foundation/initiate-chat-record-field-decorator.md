    The Microsoft Teams app displays the chat title and the opening message provided by the agent.

    The system captures the work notes about the chat details.

    ![Chat work notes](../images/chat-work-notes.png)

    If the agent initiates the chat from the record with the same user, the **Start Microsoft Teams Chat** appears as shown.

    ![Continue chat modal](../images/continue-chat.png)

    The system displays **Continue Chat** button to resume the conversation. However, if any other user is added, the chat modal displays the **Chat title** and the **Create an opening message** fields.

    The interaction is only created when the conversation is with the requester. If the conversation doesn't include the requester, such as a conversation between the agent and a collaborator, an interaction is not created, but the Microsoft Teams chat record is still created.

    A Microsoft Teams chat interaction is automatically created and you can access the chat details from the Activities log.

    1.  In the Activities log of the record, look for the comment that has the link to access the chat interaction.
    2.  Click the link.

        The chat transcript is stored in the **Activities** section.
