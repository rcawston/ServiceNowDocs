# Components installed with Content Governance

Several types of components install with the activation of the Content Governance \[sn\_cg\] plugin, including tables, user roles, and scheduled jobs.

**Note:** The Application Files table lists the components that are installed with this application. For instructions on how to access this table, see [Find components installed with an application](../../platform-administration/find-components.md).

Demo data is available for this feature.

**Note:** The Content Governance \[sn\_cg\] plugin activates the sn\_cda.min\_admin\_count system property \[sys\_properties.list\]. This property prevents you from deleting your only Governance admin user by requiring a minimum number \(default is two\) of active users with this role.
