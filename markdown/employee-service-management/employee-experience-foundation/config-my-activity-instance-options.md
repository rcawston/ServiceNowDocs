4.  Click **Save**.

5.  **My Active Items Widget Layout Guidance**

    The My Active Items widget is designed for optimal display and usability when configured using a column size of 3 or greater. This layout ensures that information presented within the widget remains readable and visually consistent across Employee Center topics.

    **Note:** The My Active Items widget does not support column sizes less than 3. If you use a column size below 3, the widget is not guaranteed to display correctly for all screen widths. Currently, there are no plans to improve support for smaller column sizes. We suggest you use a column size of 3 or higher moving forward.
