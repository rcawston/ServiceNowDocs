# Activate Now Assist for Employee Experience skills

Activate Now Assist for Employee Experience skills to enable AI-powered summarization and assistance capabilities for employee requests, cases, and approval workflows.

## Before you begin

Before activating the Now Assist for Employee Experience skills, you must install the following plugins:

-   Now Assist for Employee Experience
-   Now Assist for HR Service Delivery \(HRSD\) — required for the Case summarization for approvals skill
-   Now Assist for IT Service Management \(ITSM\) — required for the Request summarization for approvals and Requested Item summarization for approvals skills

Role required: admin

## About this task

Activate the Now Assist for Employee Experience plugin to enable generative AI on your instance.

-   Admins can select the roles for whom the skill is available.
-   When you don't have the required role to read the record, you can't see the skill summary.
-   When you activate the skill, you can see the skill or summary.
-   The OOB Applicability record includes a filter for the Employee Center portal. To display a summary on any portal, add an applicability record for that portal. The filter format is `{"URL Suffix of portal" + table : <tableName>}`.
-   By default, the availability filter isn't available. Any changes or customization can affect the availability of the summary widget.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now Assist Admin** &gt; **Skills**.

    If you're already in the Now Assist Admin console, select the **Now Assist Skills** tab.

2.  On the navigation panel, select **Employee** &gt; ****Employee Center to review the skill set.

    Toggle between the list and grid layouts for optimum viewing experience.

    **Note:** All three approval summarization skills appear only if Now Assist for HR Service Delivery \(HRSD\) and Now Assist for Employee Experience are installed. If either plugin is missing, the corresponding skills will not be present in the list.

3.  Verify and use the out-of-box settings in **General details**, **Choose input**, and so on.

    Use the options in the default setup for the most common use cases.

    -   Select the step in the guided setup navigation.
    -   Return to a previous step by selecting **Back**.
    -   Select **Save and continue** to go to the next step.
