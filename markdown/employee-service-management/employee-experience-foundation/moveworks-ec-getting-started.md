# Getting started with Moveworks for Employee Center

Moveworks integration adds an AI assistant to Employee Center replacing the standard Virtual Agent with Moveworks conversational AI.

A new plugin, Moveworks for Employee Center \(sn\_ex\_mw\_chat\_int\) assistant, lets your entire workforce ask questions, get instant answers, and complete tasks end-to-end.

Using the Moveworks chat assistant, you can access knowledge articles, requests, and tasks. Ensure that you activate the EC applications before installing the Moveworks app from ServiceNow Store.

-   Employee Center \(sn\_ex\_sp\)
-   Employee Center Pro \(sn\_ex\_sp\_pro\)

-   Upload the Java KeyStore \(JKS\) certificate and create JWT provider.
-   Configure the bot ID and Embedded AI Assistant.
