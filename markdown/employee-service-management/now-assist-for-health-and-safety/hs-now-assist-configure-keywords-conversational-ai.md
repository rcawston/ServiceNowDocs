# Configure keywords for conversational AI

Configure keywords on the incident and observation record producers to enable conversational Health and Safety reporting in the Now Assist panel.

## Before you begin

Verify that the application scope is selected as Health and Safety Core. For more information, see [Application picker](../../application-development/c_ApplicationPicker.md).

Role required: sn\_ohs\_im.admin

## About this task

The keywords for the incident or observation record for conversation AI are the relevant tags used to generate a response in the Now Assist panel. The keywords must be added as a comma-separated list of words.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Catalog** &gt; **Catalog definitions** &gt; **Record producers**.

2.  In the record producers list, select:

    -   **Report Health and Safety Incident-Basic** for incident records.
    -   **Report Health and Safety Observations** for observation records.
    For more information on how to use record producers, see [Record Producer](../../servicenow-platform/service-catalog/c_RecordProducer.md).

3.  In the **Meta** field, add keywords.

    A few examples of keywords can be health, safety, incident, injury, or observation.

4.  Select **Update**.


## Result

The keywords are saved to the record producer. Employees can use these keywords in the Now Assist panel to trigger conversational reporting for Health and Safety incidents or observations.
